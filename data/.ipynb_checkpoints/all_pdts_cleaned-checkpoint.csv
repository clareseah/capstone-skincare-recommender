The Face Vinegar contains Actibiome, a novel prebiotic that works to calm stressed skin and prevent it from further irritations alongside postbiotics that allow the skin’s beneficial bacteria to flourish. The second active is Hibiscus Vinegar. Extracted from the Hibiscus flower that’s native to Central America, it is rich in acetic acid, with astringent properties, to gently dislodge dirt and unhealthy bacteria. Another important ingredient is tannins, which has been found to regulate sebum. It is also full of antioxidants that help stop free radicals from attacking and degrading skin cells. Oxidative stress is reduced so the skin can remain protected from external ageing factors. The gentle exfoliating action of AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) stimulates cell renewal for a smoother, refined finish.

Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,"A hydrating moisturizer that infuses skin with high-potency, advanced vitamin C (THD ascorbate) to fight the first visible signs of aging while providing powerful antioxidant support.","C.E.O. C + E Protect and Repair Moisturizer infuses five per cent advanced, oxygen-stable tetrahexydecyl ascorbate (THD ascorbate) into the skin—the gold standard form of vitamin C. THD ascorbate is the newer, clinically-proven, oil-soluble derivative of vitamin C, which penetrates better into the skin while being exceptionally stable against oxygenation. With 5 per cent THD ascorbate, this moisturizer is powerful at fighting the first visible signs of ageing and restoring vital skin radiance, while being uniquely suitable for those with sensitive skin, as THD ascorbate is significantly less irritating than other forms of vitamin C. Once in the skin, it helps boost youthful-looking skin texture and volume, in addition to providing photostable, antioxidant support. Blended with protective, anti-pollution expopolysaccharides and refining lime pearl extract, this formula visibly repairs the effects of ageing, environmental stress, and pollution-induced damage. It is rich yet never greasy, providing hydration and antioxidant protection to the skin for a visibly younger, softer, and healthier-looking complexion.","AHAs, Anti-oxidants, Fragrance-free, Paraben-free, Sulphate-free, Vitamins","Water, Squalane, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, C10-18 Triglycerides, Peg-8 Beeswax, Polyglyceryl-6 Distearate, Tapioca Starch, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Citric Acid, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Glycerin, Citrus Tangerina Peel Oil, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Bisabolol, Jojoba Esters, Tocopherol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Limonene, Phenoxyethanol, Lecithin, Nylon-12, Rosa Centifolia Flower Wax, Rosa Damascena Flower Wax, Sodium Phytate, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Chlorphenesin, Citrus Australasica Fruit Extract, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Citrus Junos Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa Root Extract, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lippia Citriodora Flower Extract, Oenothera Biennis Seed Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Alteromonas Ferment Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Dehydroacetic Acid.",https://image-optimizer-reg.production.sephora-asia.net/images/product_images/closeup_1_Product_817494012996-Sunday-Riley-CEO-Vitamin-C-Rich-Hydration-Cream-50g_ce936f34dfa936ad1da5538d5a6e7e0ed9e7b564_1581582852.png,"Combination,Dry,Normal,Oily","Ageing,Dryness,Dullness,Pigmentation&DarkSpots,UnevenSkinTexture",Cream,"20s,30s,40s,50+,Under20",night_cream

Containing 22% Non-nano Zinc Oxide, this 100% Mineral formula is ideal for daily use and suitable for all skin types including breakout prone and sensitive due to its non-comedogenic and non-irritating properties. Due to its natural chalky form, Zinc Oxide can leave a white residue on the skin. To help enhance usability, a low-level non-cosmetic tint was added to help counterbalance and assist in blending into the skin. The formula has also been created with layering in mind and does not pill when used with other skincare and make-up products.","AHAs, Anti-oxidants, Clean at Sephora, Fragrance-free, Mineral, Paraben-free, Sulphate-free, Vitamins","Aqua (Water/Eau), CI 77947 (Zinc Oxide), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Coconut Alkanes, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Silica, PEG-100 Stearate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane/Silica Crosspolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Panthenol, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polysilicone-11, Squalane, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lecithin, Polysorbate 60, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tocopherol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Sorbitan Isostearate, Biosaccharide Gum-4, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil.",https://image-optimizer-reg.production.sephora-asia.net/images/product_images/closeup_1_Product_5060422298688-The-Inkey-List-Spf-30-Sunscreen-50ml_7e0c1283711e6e4db4c0c094cd24069a9176b4dd_1618687976.png,"Combination,Dry,Normal,Oily","Ageing,Dryness,Dullness",Cream,"20s,30s,40s,50+,Under20",sunscreen
