OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,Great night moisturiser,"I've been using this every night since I got it. It feels light and cool but sufficiently moisturising for my skin. I think it has improved my skin's appearance over the last month. It smells good too. A little goes a long way so even though the price point is on the high side for me, I think I'll get sufficient value for it over time."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,love this product ,"I love this product and the range of ole Henriksen , it has to be one of the better moisturiser out there. My face feels moist and soft. It’s not greasy or oily! ! ! ❤️ ❤️  ❤️
"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,Best face cream,"This peptide moisturiser is the one I was looking for. I have been using this for few weeks now and I have noticed a change in my skin already. My skin is more 
plump and even. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,Great product,"It does need a second to melt, but it is really nourishing and smoothing, the scent is pleasant too. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,miss ,Wow I am impressed. I always get a lighter moisturiser because I am oily but this moisturiser has nourished my skin and gives it a good drink. I don’t feel like it gets oily through the day. Wish there was an SPF version too
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,Trainer Peptide,Love this! I use this AM and PM.It helps improves dryness and redness on skin after skin treatment. I dont need eye cream this improves wrinkles under eye too.Finished 3 bottle and will continue repurchasing!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,Incredible for mature skin!,"I've tried a lot of creams for mature skin, and I've spent thousands of dollars finding the right one - but I've hit the jackpot with Ole Henriksen Strength Trainer Peptide Cream!
I've been using it once daily (mornings), and in less than a week, my skin has firmed, looks hydrated and plumped!
A little goes a very long way. It's not greasy, it doesn't clog my pores - it glides on ever-so smooth and easy. Well worth the money spent and before the jar I have is empty, I'll be stocking up on more!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Canada,My skin thanks me,Texture isn’t too oily and probably the best moisturizer I’ve ever used.  I had seen Tati Westbrook talked about it and raving about and I had to give it a shot. Highly recommend
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,"The most hydrating, beautiful product I’ve ever used. ","I was recommended to try this product by my sister who has the complete opposite skin type to me (she’s oily, I’m dry & sensitive) and it’s just perfect. It goes on so well you really don’t need much so don’t let the size of the jar stress you out. Less is more with this product. I’m so in love with it and feel like I’ve finally found my staple face moisturiser!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,My go to ,"I’ve bought 3 of tees so far, it being my third jar. I love that it lasts for so long because it feels so luxurious on the skin. It gives me enough moisture without feeling heavy or icky. I have dry/eczema skin. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Canada,Liking this,"I have only used for about a month yet and I feel confident it will do great. Just have to wait and see.
Texture is easy to apply but I wish it were on the creamier side.
A bit oily for my oily skin but should be fine because I expect bedtime products to have more masking strength.
There's a scent to it but mild. So far so good."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Odd consistency and doesn't moisturize well,"I'm a big fan of most Ole Henriksen products but this one was a bit of a let-down for me. I have combination skin that leans dry, and I was looking for a good moisturizer. It has a nice clean scent, but that's about the only thing I liked about it - the product is very thick (in a weird, plastic-y way), and it just felt heavy on my face without moisturizing regardless of how much or how little I applied. It also caused some texture that wasn't there before to appear on my skin. I ended up throwing this in the ""emergency products"" box in my bathroom cabinet as a last resort moisturizer, but I would not repurchase it."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,I like!,Didn't think it was for me but I will always try anything even though I've got sensitive skin. Feel more moisturised however for the price tag..... don't think I'd come back. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,all time fav ,"This is my second time purchasing this moisturiser I can’t fault it, it’s like a gel cream texture and great from my combination dry and oily skin it has a little bit of fragrance but not overpowering at all, just nice and fresh"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,nice product ,Nice moisturiser can’t say it was life changing but I have finished the whole thing without realising so obviously kept going back to it. Very nice and easy to work with. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,beautiful,i bought this after recommendation from a sephora worker - so glad i did. love the texture - it’s a rich gel/cream at the same time. a little goes a long way with this product. my skin is dry and sensitive/acne prone and this has managed to keep my skin moisturised without irritating whatsoever. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Singapore,Moisturiser,Love this product. Texture is cream yet not very heavy. Price point is good too
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,It's become a staple,"Such a wonderful moisturizer for dry/winter skin. It can feel a bit heavy at first, but does dry down after 15 minutes or so. I will continue to repurchase because it meets my combo/dry skin needs and smells great (very light citrus smell)."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,LOVE,"Love this! I use it night and when I wake up the next morning my skin looks so glowy and fresh. it also smells amazing! it's worth the cost as a little goes a long way, plus amazing effects. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Canada,A Must Have In My Skincare Routine,I use this faithfully morning and night.  I was introduced to this by a beauty influencer on youtube and fell in love.  My skin looks so juicy and plump. I am 52 and there are days that I use just this because my skin looks so wonderful.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,Hydration without heaviness,Only been using this for a week so can't say what the long term results are yet if any. However it is nice and light on the skin but really hydrating at the same time. No sticky or greasy feel after application and sinks well into my skin. Plus no irritation from it either. And it's nice under make-up. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Combo Skin Friendly!,After using this moisturizer for the past month or so I've concluded that I enjoy it a lot. I have combo skin and I love using this moisturizer not only at night but also to prep my skin for makeup. You only need a little bit for your entire face and it does not leave you feeling greasy at all. I also have acne prone skin and the skin around my eyes is very sensitive and I'm happy to report that I have not experience any breakouts nor any kind of burning or stinging sensation on my eyes after using this product. Bottom line it is really good and I will buy it again.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Canada,Not worth the price,Literally DOES NOT compare to the Ole Henriksen Sheer Perfecting Moisturizer. This moisturizer is so thick and caused me to breakout and have so many whiteheads. Would not recommend at all.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Malaysia,an ‘okay’,"Been using this for a month and couldn’t see any effect at all, other than just moisturizing,which any other moisturizer would do. Not heavy or anything. In fact, not moisturizing enough for my skin. Has a faint scent of fresh lemon but not bothersome. A bit pricy for the amount. But got free gifts from ole henriksen"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,best nourishing moisturiser around,"I really love this. I can use it day and night and it is really hydrating, soothing, and nourishing for my skin. It has a thick texture but goes on the skin great. I can also wear it under makeup with no issues. If you have sensitive skin, try this."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Breakout madness,"I never break out but this gave me bumpy skin and huge cystic acne. Not sure what ingredient triggered it, so sad!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Singapore,uncertain ,"It’s an adequate product for daily use but I don’t see results on my face. It does provide some moisturizing effect but I don’t see any difference to my complexion 
"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Immediately no.,"Nope. My skin Hated this. I got this per Katie Fawns recommendation and pure regret. I looked up comedogenic ingredients and this has EVERY SINGLE ONE. I wanted to love this, but absolutely not. Since I purchased this I have the worst clogged pores around my mouth. Ugh wish I could return but it’s too late! Do not get this if you’re acne prone. 

not."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Obsessed.,I live in a super dry climate so keeping my skin moisturized is a constant battle. I use this at night followed by a face oil and in the morning under my makeup. My skin is pillowy and moisturized without feeling heavy. Already repurchased.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,gave my skin a boost ,Can see why it’s highly rated - it feels light and fresh but deeply moisturising at the same time. Smells pleasant. Another great product from ole henriksen! 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,love this,I use this after cleansing with the YTTP kale cleanser and a little goes a long way. Super hydrating. I just bought my second pot. My skin has never been better! 4 stars because of the price. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Singapore,Fave cream!,"this is my first time using and I'm officially a convert! the consistency of the gel cream texture is suitable for both and night for my combi skin. my skin felt supple the next morning when used at night.
"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,Skin Food,"Lightweight texture, however is full of substance & a little goes along way, very emollient. It feeds the skin with every ingredient, proven to hydrate, support & protect it. Use under makeup to improve foundation performance or at night to assist skin rejuvenation while at rest. Add a Booster Serum like Fresh’s new Serum Elixir & your skin will thank you for it as they go together so well. Upon application has a light citrus aroma that doesn’t linger long, Feels like your feeding your skin topically with a recipe that works."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Canada,Nice thick consistency,I think it is good but I like La Mer moisturiser  more!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Canada,NEW FAVOURITE,"LOVE this product.  I used to use the Algenist Anti Aging Moisturizer and loved it at first but it didnt really change my skin much and is double the price of this.  When my local store ran out of that, I tried this one, and now I've made the switch.  It is super hydrating but doesnt leave your skin oily.  Makeup goes on very smooth and stays hydrated all day.  Very subtle pleasant scent.  A little goes a long way.  And has everything you could want: peptides, amino acids, ceramides, collagen, hyaluronic acid!  Great product, would highly recommend!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Malaysia,Smells greatttt!,"I love Ole so much! The moisturizer is definitely my fav. The texture is like pudding but I like it. Not sure what kind of smell this is. Just that I don't really like the greasy feeling, it's like my face is really oily after applying it. Overall, very smooth and hydrating!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Moisturizing and brightening without suffocating,"This is my third OleHenriksen moisturizer I’ve tried and it’s by far the best. It’s a perfect mix between a lotion and gel feel. It smells amazing, feels great on the skin, and makes my skin look more alive"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,"Okay, but needs to list their ingredients!","After using this product, I’m not sure I can justify the price point. I wish I had known that this company doesn’t list its ingredients and just expects us to trust that nothing crazy is in the ingredients."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,newest fav!!,have already gone through 3 tubs! doesn't make me get all shiny and oily half way through the day and still hydrates enough and doesn't break out my easily congested skin
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Life Changing,"I would consider myself to have dry skin. I have used Tatcha, skin fix￼, first aid beauty, and fresh. NONE compared to this. My skin is glowing, bouncy, and so well hydrated. ￼"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Singapore,Super hydrating and plumping,Was recommended this moisturiser due to my dry skin and I must say... its one of my BEST buys from Sephora so far. Its super hydrating and it makes my skin looks so plump and healthy. Love it!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Dried out my skin,Wanted to like this but it dried my skin out and made it rough. So sad.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Singapore,Favorite moisturizer ,"It has everything good in it, amazing formulation and ingredients. This is really good for people who want every good ingredient on their face but too lazy to go through a multiple step routine every night. I love the balmy texture, feels amazing on my skin. Very very hydrating. This is now my holy grail moisturizer. I hope this will continue to be restocked. I’ve only used this at night or during the day when I’m not wearing make up. So I don’t know if it will pill under makeup."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Bought this because of Tati,"This really is as good as everyone says! I really don’t need another moisturizer or primer but when you tell me something acts as a two I one, my interest is peeked. This is brilliant and don’t make my skin feel oily. Soaks in great and does blur a hit."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,mixed feelings ,"I don’t know how I feel about this moisturiser🤷‍♀️ I use it everyday now but! I avoided using it for 2 weeks after I bought it’s because I thought it would be too “heavy” for my skin, it feels a bit greasy when you apply it, you need to give a few good minutes to soak in and then bam! It’s great . I guess it grows on you. Probably better for dry skin and winter weather
"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Ole Henriksen Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer - 50ml,"Didn’t think I’d like this moisturizer but I gave it a try anyways! So glad I did, I have very sensitive/ oily skin and for me it works well! I use it at night when I don’t use any retinols, works well when I use lactic acids!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Singapore,moisturizer,wonderful wonderful i will order again when there is another round of sale. highly recommendable for dry skin. this can be applied day and night. therefore very versatile.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,best moisturiser!!!,"it doesn't compare with other moisturisers on the market, definitely lives up to all the claims and expectations, only moisturiser I haven't waited for it to be on sale to buy! because it's worth it!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Just Doesn't Cut it,I tried to like this moisturizer for months after the Sheer Transformation Perfecting moisturizer was discontinued. This one feels greasy and has a bad fragrance. It doesn't cut it for me.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Must have,Absolutely loved this face cream! Noticed visible results after just a few days! Will purchase again
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,New Zealand,great moisturizer ,Tried this after reading reviews for it. Was really surprised how much I liked it leaves my skin feeling so soft will definitely repurchase. Also love the smell
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Worthy of the brand name,I’m totally wow’d by this product. I’ve been looking for a new moisturizer with firming properties and this is my new holy grail. It’s thick to the touch but light on the skin. A little goes a long way. I’ve noticed improvements on my skin firmness and fine lines after only a week. It’s unscented and works well under makeup or mineral sunscreen.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Hmmmmm,Cream is so moisturizing and leaves your face feeling nourished and hydrated do not use under makeup if you have oily skin though but is great for nighttime use and if u dry skin yes you love it
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,actually amazing,Actually amazing. I have used it night with moisturizer or by it’s self. Always a noticeable difference. I wish it wasn’t so expensive because it’s a dream. A little goes a long way because it does seam to melt a little when you take it out. I live in an area with 1% humidity and when I wear this at night I wake up with hydrated skin.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,New favorite moisturizer,"My new best friend, after watching YouTuber I finally gave in an bought this. Although I am older I have combo skin . Still get oily in T-Zone and was worried this would be to greasy for me.  My skin loves this , no excess oil just hydration where it needs it. At first I was only using at night because I was worried it would be to greasy for day but that is not the case. I use it as my last step before makeup and it makes my skin look fabulous. I will definitely repurchase"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Buy,I’ve been waiting for a mini. First off heard about this product being game changer on in flamed skin. Used my retinol to many nights and a row and had itchy and flakey skin…. This stuff saved me form looking all messed up. Love the owner of this brand as well . The man knows to bring it.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,love ,Received this as a sample that little pot last me a good two months or so very little goes along way especially if you emulsify it in your hands before applying leaver skin very dewy and refreshed 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Pretty good day cream,Not as moisturizing as I had hoped and a bit difficult to apply but using the applicator and waiting a bit after using a serum helped. My skin does look good and not as expensive as some of my other favorites
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,New Zealand,Love this.,"I generally don’t really care when it comes to moisturiser, but this product is a game changer! I can use this even when my skin barrier is completely wrecked and it’s so calming while being hydrating enough at the same time. As an oily person, I appreciate that the formula doesn’t leave me greasy and would still be totally happy to use this in the morning as a daily though I prefer to use it at night. Also a huge fan of the scent and texture so 10/10 will be repurchasing."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Lightweight moisture,"I have very sensitive skin, so when I smelled how good this moisturizer smelt, I was a little nervous since fragrance tends to give me a rash. However, I have been using the moisturizer for almost a month and rash / breakout free! This feels so lightweight and absorbs like a dream. I use it in the morning, then use a heavier moisturizer overnight, but for a hot summer day I love it."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Ole Henriksen Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer - 50ml,Dried my skin out - felt like I had to use a lot PLUS a hydrating serum. Won’t buy again
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Malaysia,It was okay,It was a normal moisturizer with little to no results. A little could goes a long way so I think a bottle could last for quite a while though. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,The IT moisturizer!!,This is THE ULTIMATE moisturizer!!! My skin feels juicy and glowing. It soaks in and doesn’t leave an oily residue. My skin has never looked or felt better!! I have super sensitive skin. This is incredibly gentle. Plus it smells great!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Canada,Ole Henriksen Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer - 50ml,"Best peptide moisturizer around. Smells amazing, makes my skin feel instantly moisturizer and really calms overnight."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Malaysia,it’s ok ,It’s consistency is much thicker than other moisturisers and I’m not crazy about its smell but i saw many many famous ppl using this so imma buy it too hahhaa 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,BEST EVER! ,"Highly recommend spending the money. My skin is looking more plump, healthy and glowy everyday! The texture is like a gel to cream but really sinks into the skin for long lasting hydration "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Solid and Soothing for Sensitive Skin,"I tried this moisturizer from an online recommendation. My skin is somewhat sensitive, and moisturizers in particular are often irritating for my skin, especially around the eyes. Much to my satisfaction, this moisturizer doesn’t irritate my skin at all, and feels quite soothing upon application. It’s not crazy hydrating in my opinion, so if you have very dry skin, you may need to apply quite a bit or look for something heavier. I haven’t seen a marked difference in my complexion since I’ve started using this product, but I started in a good place, and I was searching for something that doesn’t irritate my skin, and Ole definitely delivers on that front. My only gripe is that I seem to go through the product pretty fast, but that’s probably a me issue lol."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,not good,"I did not like this product at all, it did nothing, if it says moisturizer at least leave my skin with some moisture.
I used at night and waked up with really dry dehydrated skin. It’s much much better the skinfix barrier moisturizer."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,my holy grail,"obsessed! seriously can't believe how incredibly supple & soft my skin now feels. I first received this product as a sample, I had to purchase it full size. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,Perfect Moisturiser ,I love using this moisturiser as the last step in my night time skincare routine. You only need the tiniest amount as it goes from a balm to almost an oil as it heats up. This is scented which usually I would steer clear from but the scent doesn’t seem to irritate me at all. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Ole Henriksen Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer - 50ml,Made my skin turn all red and splotchy and dried it out!!!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Singapore,"3 months after use, still waiting for the miracle","Bought this 3 months ago and have been consistently using it once daily. I get occasional hormonal breakouts on the cheeks and they have not reduced. The healing of the acne is not quick either. I am still waiting for a miracle internet claims this product to perform! I am in my early 30s and I apply this after cleansing, toning and my niacinamide serum. I top it off with an SPF 50 PA+++ during the day.

Overall, it can do better to live up to the hype."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Ole Henriksen Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer - 50ml,Love love love this moisturizer. Definitely a keeper. I’m currently on my second jar and I can’t let myself run out of it. Goes on very smooth and doesn’t feel sticky afterwards.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,New Zealand,Happily surprised,"It is a good moisturiser with great consistency. The product absorbs in the skin and feels nice. I am happily surprised. Ole products are really good. Its loosing one star because its quite expensive for not immediate results. Its nice. if was $10 cheaper then I would re-buy it… so far its just on the “magic wonder” price range and not delivering as such. But, its nice and of quality ."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,Great Moisturiser,A little goes a long way and it doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy. Received a sample and I then needed to get the full size. Would highly recommend
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Ole Henriksen Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer - 50ml,After a long day of chores this is my go to after a shower!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,love it!!,"Great ingredients list love how it hydrated my skin and plumps it! Feels nice and smooth non sticky texture best moisturiser I have ever used.       
      
     
"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,Love this product!,"I’ve shopped around and tried a few moisturisers, both local and international and this by far is the best for my skin! Firstly, overall packaging and impression is luxe, and true enough the product itself is as promising as it looks! My skin never felt so smooth and supple, it just looks so happy! It glows and has a radiant look! Absolute best buy and worth every penny!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Canada,Ole Henriksen Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer - 50ml,This moisturizer is incredible for my dry skin. One of the best moisturizer I have ever used. It melts into the skin without making it oily or sticky. I am using this moisturizer from last couple of months with vitamin c serum from same brand. I would definitely buy this again.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Malaysia,ms,"I started using it with a free sample. It really moisturizes my skin and not irritating at all. Can be used day & night. Every morning, my skin feels so moisturized & supple. I already bought the bigger size twice and definitely will continue using it for my daily skincare. If you have a combination or dry skin type, this one is a 'must try'."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,STAR ⭐️ INGREDIENTS,"I’m on my 3rd jar of this moisturizer. First purchased this due to the star ingredients 8 powerful Peptides, 3 types of Ceramides, Amino Acids, and Collagen to name a few. These are the building blocks and keys to maintaining healthy glowing skin. Majority of skincare brands make one moisturizer that focuses on the peptides or the ceramides. They rarely combine the two. Personally I seek out brands like Olehenriksen. My Skin is dry but I suffer from the occasional hormonal breakouts and this moisturizer never breaks me out. This has a very, very light scent. I wish it had zero in it but that’s my only con with this moisturizer if I’m being extra picky. Has a great gel like texture that melts into the skin effortlessly. This keep me moisturized while reinforcing my skin barrier. Excellent Anti Aging Moisturizer"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,Does what it says,One of my all time favs. I've loved it since the first day I tried it. I have sensitive skin and this didn't give me any trouble at all. Would highly recommend it to anyone
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,Purple pot of goodness ,"What a lovely little purple pot of goodness! I love using this moisturiser. It reminds me a lot of Creme de La Mer. The texture is almost identical. I live in a place that’s very cold in
winter and they both have the same solid texture. As soon as you put this on the skin, it warms up and melts. It’s absolutely beautiful. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Perfect Balance,"I've honestly waited to review this so I can come up with a better way to describe why I love this moisturizer so much. But the major reason is that it really feels so good on my skin. It's not too heavy, you don't need very much of it at all, absorbs quickly and I feel like it gives a bouncy chopper without making me oily. The days I wear tretinoin at night, I apply a heavier layer of this in the morning and it does help to keep some flakiness at bay. Love this product."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Malaysia,New Fav,Love this! My new Fav! I rly feel like it helps with my skin barrier. Also my super sensitive acne prone skin dud not break out after using this and thats always a plus for me! Deffo will repurchase! 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Ole Henriksen Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer - 50ml,so hydrating and plumping. doesn't cause breakouts. great smell
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,As the name suggests ,Rich moisturiser that is fantastic for winter use. I’d recommend to be careful using actives too often with this moisturiser. I layered this on glycolic acid toner and gave me slight tingle. Otherwise it’s great. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,YouTube made me buy this,"I saw Tati Beauty rave about this moisturiser on her channel so I took a leap and purchased. I really like this product, it sort of melts down nicely into a balmy texture without being too heavy or oily. Makeup applies well over the top (I never use a primer) and the smell is clean & fresh. A little goes a long way as even with daily use it's lasted ages. Has it changed my skin? No, not noticeably at all but it's still a lovely moisturiser. I'm unsure if someone with super oily skin would love the texture but it's fine for my combination face (and I live in a warm climate).

The only thing I don't love as much is that it comes in a pot, I hate getting product under my nails etc as it begins to run low. I'd definitely repurchase though."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Not for dry skin IMO,"I bought this moisturizer during the spring savings event and have used it on and off for several months. Right now I have very dry skin due to several acne treatments and actives I am using. Regardless of the acne treatments, I have always been on the drier side. Once I started using this regularly I realized that it really wasn’t hydrating my skin enough. I would wake up with super dry skin. And my makeup would look terrible part way through the day after using this moisturizer, because I was so dry and flaky. I think this product may work wonders on combo or oily skin, but it didn’t work out for me. I think it’s great that it is a clean product though!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Canada,Ole Henriksen Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer - 50ml,Love this product. I really see a difference in my skin. It moisturizers just enough. I don’t like to feel my skin too oily and this is perfect. What’s amazing about this product is you can mix it with other products and it works wonderfully. I mix it with a few drops of Isle of paradise and I love the glow ! Worth the buy.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,broke me out! ,"I was so excited to try this… I’m in my 30’s with combination skin and was looking forward to feeling hydrated. At first application, it’s gorgeous - lovely rich formula and really nice scent. Every time I use this, I break out. I’ve tried stripping back my routine and had periods of using this and weeks where I tried my more gentle moisturiser and it definitely does break me out. I now use it on my hands to not waste it. An expensive mistake. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,Perfect ,Perfect for my dry winter skin! My husband has also been using this product and really loves it. Absorbs well into skin and works wonders. Will purchase again!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Canada,Ole Henriksen Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer - 50ml,The texture is a little tacky on the skin it’s very gel like and leaves a glow after application. I have oily skin so little goes a long way and used this at night . at first I woke up feeling like the product hadn’t absorbed as surface of skin still felt slightly sticky but the more I’ve used it I realize how moisturized and soft and plump it made my skin . I’m obsessed! Does have a fragrance if you’re not into that . It may just be my new go to over DE polypeptide moisturizer
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Singapore,luxurious,Luxurious cream to repair sensitized or compromised skin. Feels moisturizing but not overly heavy. Minus one star for the irritating orange fragrance consistent with OH. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,USA,Not hydrating enough,"I have normal skin, and this still wasn’t hydrating enough for me. I use a Hyaluronic acid serum, as well as a facial oil, with this on top, and my skin still feels tight in the morning."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Malaysia,yummy!,"I have dry skin and this cream is my HG!! I like the velvet texture as I rub it with my hand before I tap it to my skin. No overpowering smell, no irritation and no breakout. So glad that I found this cream"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Strength Trainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer,Australia,Good but not enough ,"Surprisingly this moisturiser texture is like a balm. Lightweight feels with a refreshing light scent. I enjoyed the texture and it absorbs nicely into the skin. However, it doesn't offer enough moisture for me. My skin becomes dry halfway through my day. I think I will prefer this moisturiser in the Spring/Summer to Winter. "

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Canada,Love it,"It's weird because a lot of people have mentioned that this pilled. I've worn this moisturizer over makeup and haven't experienced any pilling. I really like this - I have oily/combo skin and it's on the heavy/super moisturizing side, but I'm finding that it's perfect for the cool, dry autumn months in Canada. The smell is light, which is perfect because I like some scent but heavily scented products irritate my skin. I liked it so much I just ordered the Christmas gift set with the toner and serum, and the hydrating spray."

"
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,USA,A disappointing experience,"After using this cream for just a few days, my rosacea flared up for the first time in a long time.  I also found that this cream is not that well absorbed into my skin and pills under make-up.  This is the first time I've experienced this kind of problem.  Also, the scent was more like cucumber than rose.  I will not be buying this again.  I'm going back to Skin Fix."

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,Deep hydration,"This product provides deep hydration. I only use it at night, sleeping in aircon room and wakes up with a thin foil of protection on my skin. I think it provides good moisturizing effect but not so fond of the smell.

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Australia,soft like a baby,"I brought this when I was fresh from having a baby to help counter the fact that I really wasn't looking after myself.

it felt amazing. I would touch my skin all day and it would still feel amazing.

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,so-so only ,"Bought this as had used before Fresh moisturizer cream and was not too bad.

However this cream was not that good , for me at least.
First this cream does not work well under makeup. It ruin all my base makeup badly.
Secondly the hydrating level is neutral level,not thick nor lightweight. "
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Canada,Pills something fierce,"I like the hydration level provided, however, after I use it, I cannot use makeup of any kind. It pills and makes my face look like it is decomposing. Not sure if it’s actually dissolving the top level of my dermis. (My face) starts out with cracks and fissures, and then pills like an old sweater. Absolutely awful (and for the price!)."
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,New Zealand,Perfect!!,This is best hydrating face cream I’ve found in a long time. Have a tried a few other but this is the best!  I have used it for some time now and will continue to use! 5stars
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,USA,Prepare for Lots of Pilling!,"This moisturizer caused a massive amount of pilling. I don't understand all the positive reviews. I eliminated my other products because I thought the pilling could be caused by them not mixing well with my other products. That wasn't it; I still had pilling. I already exfoliate twice a week, so it wasn't a lack of exfoliation problem. I quit using it and the pilling stopped."
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Australia,very hydrating,hydrating cream with some light rose scent. as my skin is typically very dry so it was not as hydrating as how I wanted it to be as I have tried others that are more hydrating.
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,"fast absorption, non-sticky feel",Love this moisturiser! I have oily skin but this moisturiser absorbs fast on my skin and doesn’t leave a sticky residue. It isn’t the most light weight in my opinion but it doesn’t feel to heavy too!

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Australia,pretty,"This cream smells so nice and like roses, makes you feel pretty and feminine! However it is so basic and doesn’t really feeel like anything special. When I use this in the night, I add a drop or two of rosehip oil from the ordinary and this really helps."
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,Honestly not a fan,im honestly not a fan of this face cream contrary to all the hype. the rose smell is a little too strong for me and it is a little sticky on application

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,I love roses,"I love the subtle smell of roses in this cream. It is lighter in consistency. And I uses this in my morning and night time routine. However, i do prefer using it at night time as the last skin care routine."
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,"Pilling on face, leaves a film","I regularly use the rose deep hydration toner and the Kombucha treatment essence for my AM routine. Tried this moisturizer but it didn’t work out for me. While I like the rose scent, this thick formula sits on my skin for hours as a film and does not absorb well. Combine this with SG’s humidity, perspiration and the moisturizer makes my face feel slick and greasy. Tried it on freshly cleansed skin and it PILLS (creates lil wisps and balls up). Eliminating it from my AM routine."
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,New Zealand,Excellent moisturizer,"Lovely fragrance. Makes the skin soft and supple. Highly recommend this product.  Good size jar and good value for money.

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,fresh at 20off ,"Bought this at 20 percent off, not bad but could be better. I hope all my purchases will come with fresh samples sachet, thats how I repurchase at Sephora. Just that recently different outlet is not like that "
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,little to no result,"Im a fresh fanatic but this is a miss for me. It smells great and all but its really does not do anything for my skin. If this is your first time trying Fresh, id say try a sample first. All in all i would not recommend. Regret buying this right after i apply it on my skin. Sticking to my other fresh favs like black tea, Umbrian clay masks and tea elixir serum"
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Australia,Not worth price tag,"I bought this in the 15ml and while it is definitely moisturising the bad outweighs the good. It will pill pretty badly on top of or underneath any other product. Like really badly, I would wake up with dried product flaked on my pillow. Also the smell of rose spoils pretty quickly (within a week) as it usually does in moisturisers I’ve found. Honestly, yeah its moisturising but the hassle of it is soooo not worth the price. Won’t repurchase."
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,USA,A fan of this moisturizer,I am on my 3rd or 4th jar of this moisturizer.  It is very hydrating and leaves my skin with a nice glow.  It also has a nice scent.  I’m very happy with this product - it’s worth the price you pay for it.
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Australia,Very disappointing ,"Okay so firstly this cream has a very strong smell for a facial cream. I know, 'rose' is in the name but this smells stronger than some body lotions. The really disappointing thing is that it'pils'into little balls almost immediately as you apply it and is basically impossible to apply makeup on top of. It even pils if you aren't wearing makeup. I think I should have returned this cream as it really isn't usuable as a facial moisturiser. 
I'll keep it as a cream to rub into my cuticles or heels. 
"
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Canada,FINALLY amazing hydration for sensitive skin,"after using this my skin is so glowy, so bouncy, so smooth!
redness is gone, acne is at bay.
the jar lasted me almost 4 months using it every night, and such a reasonable price!
thank you, Fresh!!"
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Australia,Beautifully  soft,"I got this as a satchel sample and loved it so much I purchased the travel size to try out for a longer period. It feels amazingly soft and hydrating and sinks right into the skin. I have sensitive combination skin and this doesn't irritate or cause any breakout, and it lasts a full day 24 hours without  causing oily or shiny spots. It's also nice to use over serums especially BHA's and retina as it provides a soft nourishing moisturiser over those serums that can sometimes dry out patches of the face. I will definitely buy this again."
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Philippines,good,"Does not cause any irritation on my sensitive/dry/skin.

Got this less 25% off on sephora’s sale. Great value for money. Will definitely re-purchase. "

I had very Low expectations since this brand doesn't really have products that work for my skin but I picked this up because I loved the scent and wanted to give the entire line a try. And oh my gosh I am WOWED. I had severe dry skin, flakes and everything, when I tried this. I'm on day 2 and my flakes are already almost 100% gone. I will be getting a larger size."

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,Fresh Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream,I have been using Fresh products and I bought this as a night cream as the texture is heavier. It is moisturing and my skin feels hydrated and supple in the morning. The rose smell has a calming effect and smells lovely. Would be good if the bottle can be the dispenser type as it would be more convenient to apply on the face. 
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,ok only ,Tried this product for a while now. But I just realised that this product does not suit my skin type. It is cream based so it is too thick for my skin type. My skin type is mixture of oily on T zone and dry on other areas.

it is slightly scented however not to overpowering I personally love the scent!

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Canada,The hunt has ended. amazing cream.,"I have been searching for a face cream that provides the hydration the majority of my skin needs, while being tolerable on the sensitive spots, and not causing me to break out.

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,Maybe not for sensitive skin,"I love fresh, but not all products are made the same. Sadly this wasn’t very suitable for my sensitive skin, I prefer the fresh rose hydrating mask, that did a better job, this caused skin irritation "

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,Lovely rose scent,"It's quite moisturizing, and I love the soft rose scent. Though my mum didn't share the sentiments regarding the rose scent.  The downside is that the price is a little steep. But overall a nice moisturizer. I'll repurchase again though, but this time online because the in-store sales person doesn't give me any free samples to try out, unlike the online store."
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,Fav moisturiser ,"Very thick, rich and hydrating & has a mild clean rosewater scent. Suitable for all skin types. Absorbs well and not oily. It works on dry patches. My skin doesn’t get oily at the end of the day when I wear this, because the skin is properly hydrated and no excess oil is produced. "
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,USA,Only con is the scent.,"Don't like the rose scent and I'm not even sensitive to fragrances. I'm surprised that a great brand like this has a product with such a high scent. Smelled it for some time after I applied it to my face. I was worried because my skin doesn't do well with fragrances, I was able to use the sample for about a week and noticed no breakouts and no bad changes in face. Overall I'm kind of torn; I'd like to say I'd purchase and try to overlook the fragrance but I just really didn't like the scent."
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,A good daytime moisturiser ,"The texture of this cream is gorgeous, although I would prefer a formulation without silicones (so it wouldn’t pill under makeup / or prevent facial oil from being properly absorbed if applied after). Right now, I’ve relegated this to the final step of my skincare routine after toner. Works great."
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer,Canada,FRESH Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream Moisturizer - 15ml,I really love this moisturizer . I have combination skin it's very hydrating without being sticky or heavy. The smelll is very nice too!

Got this less 25% off on sephora’s sale. Great value for money. Will definitely re-purchase. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Singapore,nice ,"Redeemed the sample version to try out. Was impressed by it and I l love the cooling feeling it leaves behind. Waited for sale before buying the full
sized product "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,"Nope, Uh Uh, Not It","Not sure why OH changed the formula on their old oily skin moisturizer, but this new one is NOT for oily skin. It made me so oily, nearly from the minute I put it on my face. Was looking for a daytime moisturizer, but this is too much, even for night."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Malaysia,My HG moisturizer,"This moisturizer keeps my skin so clear of any texture, bumps and dare I say, acne(!!). I have combi skin and this does not feel heavy or sticky on my face. Absorbs really well and I love the gel-like consistency. I’m currently on my 2nd tub and will 10/10 repurchase this again. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Malaysia,non greasy & stay moisturised ,it is a great moisturiser and effective in removing dark spots if combined together with their AHA product. I have seen & noticed my dark spots has lighten over time
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Australia,in summer perfect ,The Green color skin care on Ole henriskeen is my to go skin care products during summer for my oily skin but definitely not on winter as it makes it more dry dry.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,Ole Henriksen Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,"It made my skin so oily. Even if I only applied it at night, my face was producing so much oil during the day. I had to return it."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Singapore,Cooling moisturiser,I started to use OleHenriksen products November last year and it didn’t had any adverse reaction to my face (oily type). I would recommend this cold plunge moisturiser during summer or if you are living in a tropical country. It’s so nice at the skin and it doesn’t leave any sticky feeling at all.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Malaysia,My skin looks smooth ,"at first only try the sample... 
After applying the product i fell in love...
so now I purchased this product....
It makes my skin smooth even when I'm wearing makeup..."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,disappointed,I liked it the first couple weeks but started noticing such a funky smell. I’d compare it to my husband’s fish tank. It’s so off putting that I try hold my breath when I put it on. I feel obligated to keep using it because the price isn’t something I could just put aside. Can’t say there’s much of a difference with my oiliness so I often use it at night. Tried it because of the high reviews but will not purchase again.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Singapore,repeat purchase ,I have very oily skin and this is my under make up moisturiser. Works on pores a little and exfoliate skin all day. So light and absorbs fast. Recommend for oily skin for under make up and on its own 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,Ole Henriksen Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,"No, no and no for oily skin. I have extremely oily skin all my life and bought this based off all the 5 star reviews. This makes my face even more oily…my face is so greasy that strands of my hair stick to my face after just a few hours. Gross. My goal was to control my oil better, not increase it. Hard no for me!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,weird texture,This feels good on my skin and refreshing but I absolutely do not like the texture...it's very weird and gummy like the cream created a liquid and a mix of textures. Not fun
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,"For the price, it’s a no.",Harsh for sensitive skin and didn’t replace my need for moisturizer. Had a oily feel after application.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Singapore,cold plunge pore remedy moisturiser,"Loved the mini sized so much that i bought the full size. Somehow enjoyed the mini size more. Liked that it is suitable for oily skin, does not add shine."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,Big fan,"I started incorpporating this in my AM routine to try and reduce sebum and pore size. It's helping! I love the lightweight feel of it and I have noticed a reduction in pore size. As part of this routine change, I have also started using a facewash with salycilic acid as well."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,New Zealand,not for me ,I found this moisturizer didn't absorb well and I would get oily skin after a few hours of wear. I do have very oily skin. Gave it hubby and worked well on his pores. I did like the minty scent and cold tingle 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,New Zealand,Refreshing and effective,This is a great everyday moisturisers but I have quite bad pores and this didn't help as much as the name suggests
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,Ole Henriksen Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,"it's fine, but i really dearly miss the old moisturizer. this one costs so much money for so little product, whereas i had more for my dollar with the old one. very unfortunate since oily skin moisturizer is harder to find"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,still made skin oily.,Smells great. And that’s about it. Didn’t do anything for my oily skin other than increasing the oilyness. Waste of money. Niacinamide powder is the only product that has actually made any sort of significant difference.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,Ole Henriksen Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,"thought i was getting lots of acne caused by my mask, actually turns out it's from this moisturizer.  found it to be really greasy and it made my acne worse. will not buy again. really wish they hadn't changed the moisturizer from this brand :("
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,Ole Henriksen Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,"I have oily skin with large pores and this has helped! However, after a week of daily use, I noticed I had a couple of breakouts. This being the only new product in my routine I knew it was it. I stopped using it right away and breakouts stopped. I use it 2-3 a week and can notice a difference for the day without breakouts."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,My skin likes it,"I really like this moisturizer and so far, my skin likes it too. My only real problem with it is that it doesn’t come with a spatula to scoop out the product. Even if my fingers are clean I don’t like it. Has to but one for it. Aside from that, it has like a cool sensation to it. Feels nice."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,Ole Henriksen Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,". Not for me; it smelled weird, felt like it was expired almost? It definitely had a  chunky consistency, so I threw it away. I love other products from this brand, but this one was a miss."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Australia,skincare enthusiast ,"If you have super oily skin that’s sensitive, I’d stay away.
First of all, the texture is quite greasy. I wasn’t a fan of how slippery my skin felt afterwards.
Secondly, because of the fragrances loaded into this product, I couldn’t use it after I’d exfoliated because it would burn like crazy. 

So try and get a sample before you commit because I was highly underwhelmed.
"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Singapore,Holy Grail ,Beautiful lightweight moisturiser that just melts into skin and gives a fairly velvety finish. I have dry skin but this is sufficiently hydrating for me. Works great under makeup. Perfect for use on hot days in the sun as it is light and non-sticky. The scent is slightly medicinal but not at all unpleasant. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,New Zealand,burns ,It burns my skin not sure that it does much else  I don’t use it that much because of how it feels.  for the price point there’s probably better out there wouldn’t repurchase .          
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Singapore,calming and effective,"I love how this feels - cool, light, yet hydrating. it does a really great job of minimizing pores. it's also a perfect layer under makeup. it's not cheap, though"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Australia,The Best!,I am so in love with this brand!!! Everything I have bought has been so effective and my skin just loves it. My skin has improved so much since starting this!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,Not As Good As the Old Moisturizer,"Wanted to love this but the texture is just all wrong for me. I use the Ole Henriksen Pore cleanser and LOVE it. The Henriksen moisturizer that used to come in the Pore kit was so much better. So much smoother, went on the skin and actually soaked in; this stuff is so thick it just sits on top of my skin and makes it feel sticky and slightly greasy. Can’t layer with any other products because everything else just beads up on top of it. Just not right for me and I wish they would sell the old moisturizer that came in the kit as a stand-alone. Overall it’s a good brand and I would recommend the brand itself just not this product."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,Great Moisturizer!,"I love this stuff! It’s nice and creamy but not heavy. It also has a nice, cooling feeling when you first apply it. Yes, it’s a little pricey, but it’s a big jar and a little goes a long way!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,No. Bring back the old.,No. Just no. It stinks. It doesn't moisturize well but makes me greasy at the same time. I miss the hydrator and I REALLY miss the mattifying cream. They re-released it on their website last year and I bought 5. I'm out now so I tried this since the others are no longer available and it's a no-go.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,If you have oily skin!!!,"As someone who as always dealt with very oily skin and huge pores especially around my T zone, i love this product. it is lightweight and a little goes along way. it isn’t sticky and absorbs into my skin right away. I have been using for almost a month now and I have skipped maybe two days and my face just gets extremely oily without using it. this is definitely a staple in my skin care."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Australia,ms,"Great for day and night use, light weight formula so it perfect for summer/ spring especially underneath makeup. When you apply it it has a coolish sting so I know the AHAs are working"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,Must-Have Moisturizer,"This is an amazing moisturizer for my sensitive, combination skin!  I switched to this from another product (which was also an expensive, quality moisturizer) and within days, my breakouts calmed and have begun to heal.  Am on week 3 of using this and this will be my only moisturizer from here on out."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,So Good!,"Probably my favourite moisturizer!  Feels super lightweight on the skin but gives you lots of hydration at the same time.  It has a really nice cooling effect which I love in the mornings!  I initially received this as a sample, and after using it for about 2 weeks I definitely noticed a reduction in pore size!  I struggle with small breakouts and my skin is very sensitive to products, which is why I typically reach for very basic moisturizers and cleansers, but this one hasn't broken me out and actually reduced the amount of breakouts I have."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Malaysia,Cooling effect,"I really like this cooling, lightweight moisturizer. i used it on daily basis. But im not sure if it helps detoxify and minimize the look of pores. My pores is still the same thou. It did not break me out, thank god."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Singapore,Not for me,Didn’t work for me. Breaks me out but my breaking out stop once i stop using this maybe my face is not suitable with the product. But it has good reviews so don’t be afraid to try it out ladies. Merry Xmas! 🎈
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Singapore,50ml - light and refreshing ,"Bought this based on reviews and I thought why not I give this a try. Texture was abit thick and clumpy - was expecting it to be creamy like most moisturisers. But other than that, I didn't have to dap on too much and the fragrance is light and refreshing (smells similar to their cold plunge pore mask). It doesn't make my skin oily too! "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Singapore,ms,This a good product for oil control. It comes with a light refreshing scent. You can use it on its own or apply it underneath your make up. Highly recommended. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,BRING BACK THE COUNTER BALANCE!!!,"Completely disheartened to see that the Counter Balance Oil Control Hydrator has been discontinued. Now the product line has presented this in it's place. And it. Is. Terrible. 

1. Starting with the application, I find using this open tub less sanitary than the previous moisturizer that came in a pump. 
2. Next, the SMELL! I cannot stand it on my face. It's like rotting seaweed. The ingredients say there is fragrance added...which means this odor is intentional!? 
3. I have oily acne prone skin, so I appreciated the mattifying and pore-tightening effect of the Counter Balance. This product does not claim to be mattifying, so fair enough, it certainly isn't. It does not provide a good base for my makeup and I'm greasy within an hour of washing my face and applying this. My pores remain unchanged. And I've only been using it a week, so I have yet to see if it makes me break out, but I will definitely be returning it before I wait to find out. 

This is unfortunate as I am a huge proponent of Ole Henriksen's products. This one is just a huge miss for me, particularly for my needs. PRETTY PLEASE BRING BACK THE COUNTER BALANCE OIL CONTROL HYDRATOR!!!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Malaysia,suitable for hot weather,"I decided to buy the full size after I tried the sample size. Dont need much for entire face. It doesn’t become oily after whole day, especially in hot and humid weather. Will purchase again when there is sephora sales"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Australia,Light and fresh,"I use this over my OH morning serum and under my skinscreen, and it works perfectly. Moisturises without being heavy and soaks in quickly.

The move to using a jar, compared to the old moisturiser in this line, is also great so you can get it all out at the end.

"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,really impressed with this,"I was bummed when I saw that the original oil control moisturizer had been discontinued, but I’m super happy with this!! It really helps to keep me matte all day, and has also helped with my acne. It provides the perfect amount  of moisture (I’m combo/oily) and wears super well under makeup. I have had no issues with burning like others have said. Definitely recommend!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,Not as impressive as I was hoping.,"Haven't seen a lot of changes with this. For as much as it costs, I thought it would do more. I will say that a little goes a long way, but if it's just for moisturizing, eh. As for including the BHA and LHA, not impressed with the results."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,Ole Henriksen Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Been on the search for a fav moisturizer for years and I’ve found it!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Singapore,ole henrisen cold plunge pore remedy moisturiser,"Heard about this brand from a influencer and decided to give it a try. I have oily but dehydrated skin so this moisturiser actually helped my skin feels hydrated, its feels light, more like a gel and easily absorbed and not oily at all. I love the texture. Been using this for 2 days now and I can see a difference and I really love it! "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,"A must, but a little goes a long way!","Love this 110% if applied correctly. I learned my lesson that too much of this made me look so oily. Through trial and error, I dotted little amounts of this around my face around the size of a dime, if that. This is not your typical moisturizer it is better! It does have a cooling sensation, hence the name ""cold plunge"". I love this product to keep my redness and spots at bay throughout the day and it helps soooooo much with maskne! Beware it does contain essential oils if you are sensitive to that."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Singapore,Good for combination oily skin,Love that it’s oil free and clean at Sephora. Helps control oil and the salicylic acid helps to keep my pores clean. Doesn’t cause any breakouts when first started using it. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,New Zealand,Amazeballs,"I have normal/oily skin and this is honestly the best moisturiser I’ve tried and I’ve tried a lot . It’s very lightweight and refreshing almost has a minty feel , other gel mousturisers have left my face feeling weirdly tight or tacky or dry but this one leaves it feeling hydrated and fresh . Highly recommend and paired with the toner too. Gamechangers "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Singapore,cold plunge pore remedy moisturizer,my new holy grail moisturizer. hydrates my skin without overdoing. consistency is not too runny or thick. the cooling effect is just so refreshing to the skin. smell is awesome. i just wish its put in a tube instead of a pot to avoid dipping hands everytime. aside from that would highly recommend.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Singapore,One good moisturiser ,I like the texture of the gel and how easy it spreads and be absorbed. A little bit goes a long way. It also smell good. It gives cooling effects so i feel like it encourages blood circulation on my face. I press the gel absorbed into my face with my warm palms and it feels good. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Singapore,Bad funky smell,"This product smells funky (smells like plastic/silicon?); weird for a product that contains fragrance in the ingredient list. Just started using this one week ago, does nothing to shrink my pores. Product batch: 1A03A Hoping that someone can check if there is any product recall for this batch."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,Ole Henriksen Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,This does exactly what it claims to do! I use it daily after I wash my face and I have noticed my pores are visibly smaller!! It makes my skin look amazing!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,TAKE THE PLUNGE,LOVE IT. I use this every single day. After I wash my face I immediately apply it. It doesn’t go on thick it’s relatively light weight and doesn’t leave your skin feeling greasy at all. Great for daily skin use in both the morning and night and light weight enough to apply makeup over it
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,Quite nice but not very hydrating,"I wanted to love it and I don’t hate it but I have pretty dry skin and this doesn’t leave long lasting moisture. I like the piney/minty smell and I like the cooling sensation as well as the gel/cream texture but I’m not going to repurchase this. 

If excess dryness isn’t your issue then you should definitely try this."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,just not for me,As much as I wanted to like this moisturizer I had to return it. It made my skin feel a bit sticky and I noticed some break out in the morning after I would put it at night. I liked the smell and the cold feeling after I put it on.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,Ole Henriksen Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I recieved this product complementary from influenster and Ole Henriksen in exhange for my honest review. 

I admit like this product! It has a great texture and goes into the skin smoothly. It is refreshing with a cold kick and tackles that mid day shine thanks to my oily skin. I can already see a difference in pore reduction and my makeup looks every better throughout the day!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,Not too bad,I have normal to dry skin and this is not too bad for this product being suggested for oily skin. I feel like it does held with acne without drying my skin out. I don’t use this every night just every other or every two nights. This product does make your face tingle which I love.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,Ole Henriksen Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,"The first thing I notice when applying this is the satisfying cool sensation and how nicely it absorbs into the skin. This is such a nice product to have with the weather heating up. I have combo skin and do notice this reduces shine when applied while still leaving that hydrated feeling. Overall, I really love it! I received this product for free in exchange for a review. #olehenriksen #taketheplunge #contest #complimentary"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,Ole Henriksen Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Received this product from influenster to review. I was skeptical at first because moisturizer usually causes my skin to become irritated and super oily. I usually end up with acne flare ups sometimes even my eczema takes a hit and glares up. Honestly I can say this moisturizer is really good! I've used it for a week now and my skin feels and looks better then ever! It has a minty smell to it and is so cool on the skin!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,I can’t believe how much my pores have shrunk!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received the new COLD PLUNGE PORE REMEDY MOISTURIZER as a gift from OLEHENRIKSEN skincare. I love this product because it is oil-free and super lightweight. Cold Plunge Pore Remedy Moisturizer is powered by BHA (SALICYLIC ACID) & LHA which helps lift and loosens dead skin cells that clogs pores. This moisturizer also has alpine willowherb extract which is rich in antioxidants to help nourish and condition the skin. I can’t believe how hydrated my face feels! It has completely diminished the look of my pores and I have never found a moisturizer to do that until now! 10/10 in my books!

I have a bit of a mixed review for this product. I like the scent, but it’s not for everyone. I found that it stung on certain parts of my face. But it did make my skin feel soft! I’ve only used it a few times so far so I haven’t noticed any difference look wise for my skin."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,Amazing Product,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Never heard about this brand before until I receiveditas a gift from Influenster. After several days I could already feel positive sides. Amazing quality, refreshing and cooling. I ended up falling in love with the product."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,Refreshing,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Looking at the moisturizer, it looked like it would be really thick but I was surprised when I applied it. It was actually not thick or too thin. Its perfect consistency and hydrating and it has a little minty smell to it which I really liked and the colour ofcourse. Im not sure about how it would work on enlarged pores as I dont suffer from that but all in all, I really liked it and it would be perfect for summers."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,Amazing surprise !!,Not a product I was expecting to fall in love with but totally did !! It’s made such a difference in my skin in just a few weeks - the smell is a bit odd but that’s the only negative part !
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,A must moisturizer for this summer,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I was gifted this product via Influenster Canada and I so happy I was.  This moisturizer cleared up the small pimples/bumps on my forehead within a few days.  The moisturizer is hydrating and leaves a cool refreshing feeling.  If you have oily/combination skin I would highly recommend.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,Ole Henriksen Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I find this to be an interesting product. It works alright as a moisturizer but I didn't see much in the way of reducing pores. It goes on really nice and cool, but I do not find this product to be anything special. I don't find it does anything better than a typical moisturizer so I don't think it'd be worth the money."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,Love!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Im a huge fan of Ole Henriksen 
The products especially the cold pore plunge mask have made a huge difference in my skin.
When the opportunity came up to try this out I jumped at it and I must say I'm a big fan of this moisturizer. Its very light weight yet hydrating and leaves behind a refreshing cooling sensation that wakes me up and I know I'm going to love jn the summer months. 
I have combo skin and this keeps my skin at bay during the day.
Also works great under makeup!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,Great Moisturizer,"This moisturizer feels amazing on my skin. It's just the right consistency and texture, not too heavy and feels silky smooth. I haven't been using it long enough to notice any real difference yet, so I'll have to reserve my judgment for a later date, but so far, so good."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,Ole Henriksen Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I like this moisturizer because it makes my make-up look great! I’ve been using it as a day cream for the past 10 days and I’m satisfied so far. I have a combination skin and my forehead and chin look pretty oily, especially when the weather gets warmer. The Cold Plunge moisturizer does the job and definitely helps with that! I’d just say that I am not a big fan of the smell and the tickling effect on the skin. Also, if you have a dry skin, it might not be hydrating enough. But overall, very good product!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,A Great addition to skin care!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) New favourite moisturizer!

I’ve had it for about four days now and it literally has already become a staple in my routine. I use it morning and night and really love the cooling effects that it has especially under my eyes. It’s safe and gentle enough to not irritate my skin but also has left my skin feeling bouncy am extremely hydrated. I have combination skin and this has not added to my oil production at all, so definitely not a worry if that is your problem with a lot of moisturizers like it is with mine. I definitely recommend this product and will be purchasing for myself when my sample is complete! 10/10 run don’t walk"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,will buy this when i run out!,I wasnt sure when i first tried this if it was gonna work for me. it makes my skin a lil dry but so clear! I've started putting some aquaphor on top of it at night and i wake up with really glowy skin. works well but can be a bit drying. also may sting or burn the first couple times. i rode the discomfort out and now im in love. i think this might be a holy grail product for me. i never knew i needed this. but now i know.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,soft and minty,"This goes on really nice on the skin, made my face feel very soft. Only downside is the minty scent, it irritated my eyes."

OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,Pretty good,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I was pretty excited to try this product as I am a big fan of the balance line. This cream is thick and refreshing on the skin and absorbed nicely. I’ve used it a few times and no breakouts. Left my skin feeling soft and glowy. I would recommend this product to anyone who has or is struggling with acne and oily skin as I did see a difference. I did receive this product free for trial. I dropped a star due to the price being a lot but I would say it’s worth it to keep skin clear of blemishes.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,a great option,I like the texture and the finish of this moisturizer. It applies nicely and dried nicely and i also like how it helps calm down redness on my face
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,Fresh smelling and love it!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Fresh smell with a hint of mint. Goes on smooth without a greasy feeling. Made my face feel moisturized for the day without the oily T zone I normally have. 
I didn’t notice a reduction in the look of my pores, but the sustained shine reduction is what makes this a five star review. 

I love it and will definitely buy it again."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,BEST MOISTURIZER EVER,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) *this is my own honest opinion*

When I received this product in the mail, I automatically put it aside for my nighttime skincare routine. What I love about this moisturizer is that it’s very lightweight. I have extremely oily skin so I knew that my skin would love a product like this. The texture is also like a cream/gel type consistency, and it doesn’t feel sticky or greasy when you apply it. Overall this moisturizer is my new favourite because I have never felt my skin this matte before... I own other moisturizers that is supposed to “help control” oil on the skin. But my moisturizers is nothing compared to this bad boy! Through the entire night my skin felt matte! I cannot wait to incorporate this moisturizer into my daytime routine!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,Ole Henriksen Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,I really liked this moisturizer. I didn’t feel oily at the end of the day but I was moisturized.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,Ole Henriksen Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really enjoyed this product as your skin feels moisturized even after the product has been absorbed into your skin. Another great feature is that this moisturizer can be used in the am or pm. It has a great mint smell and makes your skin feel cool after application. This product actually reduces the look of your pores and I have a lot which is great. Definitely would buy this again and I recommend it!!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,Ole Henriksen Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product is very good and is not deceiving! I saw some reviews saying that it irritates skin, so i would be mindful; however, I’ve been lucky. Usually with moisturizers, right after application I feel half way to a blotting sheet, but not here! I was so worried about not liking this. It does also have a strong mint scent which one may not like but I personally love.  i WILL say, it did not really blur my pores even if it does feel like a mattifying primer."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,love the smell,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this complimentary through Influenster for review purposes. I have been using this for almost a week and so far I’m really enjoying it. I have normal/combo skin and this is more of a gel consistency moisturizer so it works well for me. I’m not sure if this would be enough if you have very dry skin. I love the smell of it - it smells like a muted eucalyptus steam room. The packaging is beautiful. I would likely purchase this again.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,Ole Henriksen Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have received this product as a complimentary sample from Influenster. When I applied this product after exfoliating my face, there was a burning sensation that lasted for a little bit, but it eventually went away.  I really like how the texture was very smooth and left my face feeling refreshed with a slight minty feeling. It really moisturized my face without making it feel oily or sticky! I also feel like it did help my breakouts."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,USA,Perfect daytime moisturizer,"I love this as a daytime moisturizer. It has a lovely finish-- matte but not dull and doesn't kill the glowy-ness of your skin.  Plays well with makeup (no pilling at all!) and sinks in super quickly.  I've been using it now for about a week and I can already tell that my pores have shrunken, even when I'm not wearing this.   I have been searching forever for a moisturizer that would eliminate the midday t-zone oiliness and finally here it is, just in time for summer!  For reference, I have medium, combination  (oily t-zone with dryness around my nose), non-sensitive skin. 
Note: I received this product as a gift in exchange for my honest opinion. I am not sponsored by or affiliated in any way with OH."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Cold Plunge™ Pore Remedy Moisturizer,Canada,Amazed!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Never heard about this brand before until someone gave it to me as a gift. After several days I could already feel positive sides. Amazing quality, refreshing and cooling. I ended up falling in love with the product."

It’s one of the few moisturizers that 1) did NOT clog my pores/adverse reaction 2) did NOT sit on top of my skin 3) worked on my eczema albeit temporarily but I’ll take it! My skin is v dry and at the height of my eczema my face was literally flaking away but this holds it together tho again, it’s a temporary remedy and not a cure to my dry af skin/fix my skin barrier.

"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,USA,Worth it! Calms rosacea,"I have rosacea and super sensitive skin and I wanted a moisturizer I could use daily that wouldn’t aggravate my skin, but rather calm it down a bit. Enter this cream: at first, I didn’t think it did anything at all, but the more I used it, the smoother my skin got (less texture from the rosacea) and I saw a different in my redness on my face. As soon as you apply it to irritated and hot skin, it’s so cooling and feels so nice! I use it after Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser and it feels great. Also, for the person who said that this is just a more expensive version of Cerave — I disagree. Not all moisturizers work for everyone — for some reason, Cerave doesn’t work well at all with my skin, but FAB ultra hydrating cream truly does soothe it. Worth the price for the tub because I’ve only used about 1/5th of it and I’ve been using it every day for about 3 months now!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,Australia,Customer,"Must have! I bought it for like the 3rd time. Absolutely love it, FYI I have sensitive dry skin and this works amazing for me.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,New Zealand,Whoa! Instant relief,My skin's been acting up and had lots of dry spots. This product felt good on the skin. First I thought it would be too thick to put the rest of my makeup on top after but it worked its magic and just left my skin feeling hydrated under all those products 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream - 170g,"Honestly this stuff is not as moisturizing as it claims to be, I got retinol irritation on my neck and figured this stuff would do the trick but it’s been over two weeks and I still wake up with an itchy dry neck despite slathering this stuff on religiously. Also it makes my makeup pill like crazy. It’s definitely a rip off"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,Singapore,Decent moisturizer,"Have been using this for my sensitive skin for a while. It's texture isn't too thick, but can feel rather slimy. Feels just enough to keep my skin moisturized. Definitely value for money if you go for the large size too!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,Australia,AMAZING!,I have severe eczema but when my flare ups go down this is my go to! Unlike lotions or really heavy creams there's hydration for hours but no sluggish greasy feel of heavier creams. Changed the game for my eczema once it began to heal! I only use it once the open sores etc. have gone as it can sting like all other creams but as soon as I can put it on it heals and keeps my skin so moisturised.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,Australia,Alright product ,"In my opinion I think it’s too pricey for what it actually is. This feels like something you can get from the drugstore, an example being a Nivea cream as that’s what it reminds me of. Not the best. Wouldn’t purchase this again."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,New Zealand,very good ,This item is my favorite as it is highly hydrating and not greasy at all and suitable for all ages and skin types. I have purchased it many times and the largest package is very valuable.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,New Zealand,great,This moisturizer is really good! It did make me break out the first time I used it but that’s just because my skin is very sensitive to new products. I have been using this for about a year or two now and it has worked so well. My skin is never dry now! 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,Australia,great for ezcema,"one of the few moisturisers that I've found actually help me ezcema patches. only lost a star as it's quite pricey, but I do think that it's well worth it"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,New Zealand,The BEST thing for my skin,"I have extremely sensitive skin and bad eczema on my arms, and nothing clears my eczema list this cream. This is definitely the best product I've used to heal my skin and it works far better than any dermatologist skincare I've tried. It is so calming and soothing and you can see a huge difference in just a few days. It is pricey but a little goes a long way, definitely worth the money."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,Singapore,best I’ve tried hands down,This is the best moisturing cream I’ve ever tried. Not sticky and leaves skin like new. Recommend for all. Haven’t had anything so useful before. Good job
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,Canada,"A must have in my routine, will be repurchasing!","I love this moisturizer! I usually prefer a gel based moisturizer as I fine regular cream ones just sit on the skin and feel heavy and don't actually sink in. This isn't gel based I love the way this makes my skin feel. So soft, hydrated and refreshed. It doesn't give that glowy effect more matte finish but I still love how it feels, one of the best!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,Malaysia,Nice Consistency,Excited to try this product in a bigger bottle! Tried the sample version of it and I liked how it was thick enough but didn't feel uncomfortable on the skin. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,Australia,disappointing ,"I don't understand what's the hype about this product. it smells like you are in the hospital, and it doesn't do anything to my skin. I have an easy skin complexion (normal) and it doesn't feel hydrating. My partern hates how it smells and have to stay in distance once I use it. I regret so much buying the big bottle. waste of money "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,Singapore,Decent,It is a good product and works for eczema prone skin. But there are cheaper alternative products that works just as well.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,Malaysia,Love this,This is my holy grail! I have really dry skin and always had difficulties finding the right moisturizer.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,Australia,A classic,This is my third repurchase of this product. The tub is my favourite way to have it; I feel like I can never get all the product out of the tubes. This is my daily night-time face moisturiser. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,Malaysia,holy graillll,"beeen my holy grail for years, i think i have bought countless tubs already. no fragrance used which is also a plus point for me since i do have a very sensitive skin. the price is also super affordable compared to the drunk elephant lala retro which also shown the same result as FAB "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,USA,Basically an expensive version of cerave,"Does it work? Yes. Really well, but it’s basically cerave. You might as well just save your money and buy cerave."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,Malaysia,never change to other product,"I’ve bought this countless of times. I don’t think it will never go wrong with any active ingredient. With or without active ingredient, this will be my no 1 moisturiser "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,Canada,Worth the price,"I am a big fan of first aid beauty, though usually don’t love the prices, but this is one of the few products that I really believe is worth the price! I have tried so many more affordable moisturizers trying to find one that has the same effect as this one and just could t find it! My skin feels SO moisturizer after, even in the winter months when my skin starts to get super dry! I have to stop myself from touching my face cause it feels so smooth! It’s not oily at all and I would definitely recommend for sensitive skin, as with most first aid beauty products."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,Canada,Holy grail,"100% recommend, doesnt have a fragrance, deeply moisturizes and keeps your face hydrated for a long time. Also great primer before makeup blends so well, and feels light on the skin. I have been using it for more than 6 years now"

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,USA,Must Have for Dry Skin!,"I’ve been a fan of FAV for years. I use the face moisturizer exclusively, and I swear by the cleanser. I tried this moisturizer and it did wonders for my skin! I am a touch oily in my t zone, but I’m dry everywhere else  this left me feeling not just moisturized, but nourished. The moisture lasted a long time and I didn’t have any flakes I usually experience or cracks. This is a love for me. else. This left me"

I've been trying out different sorts of products, but only this cream works miraculously and has been a savior to help hydrate and soothe it right away! Also, it's worth the price, as a little goes a long way. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,USA,Great for Mature Skin!,"I got this for my mom who has been searching for a deeply moisturizing and protective cream because she lives in a dry climate. She absolutely loves this cream! For the price, it’s a fantastic formula and large size. I knew she was going to be slathering this on and she said her skin just drinks it up."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,USA,Not for me anymore,"Here’s the deal: this is a good product. I do recommend people try this if they’re looking for a cream for sensitive/damaged skin. This used to be great for my skin when it was stressed and dry, and it was my go to moisturizer to use with retinol, but out of nowhere it started to pill no matter where I used it or what I used it with. I’d go to sleep with it on and when I’d wake up, it looked like my pillow was covered in dead skin flakes from how much it pilled during the night. It’s such a bummer because I really did love it."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Cream,Australia,Go to,"I really like this moisturiser, it’s been my go to for a number of years, even when I stray away I always come back, amazing for dry skin "

GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,For the product itself I’m giving 3.5 stars because it’s just okay.  Not my favorite moisturizer.  But I love how it’s better for the environment and having a refillable option.  Giving an extra star just for that!
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Singapore,HOLY GRAIL!!!!,"This product is a holy grail! Been buying this over and over again - one I will not ditch anytime soon. 

Works very well with my oily skin and its aaaamazing!"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Sticky and doesn’t really soak into skin,This product gives you a glow but it really just sits on top of the skin and I find that it stays sticky forever :/ I don’t love it under makeup either and I have dry skin. It smells really nice and feels good but it leaves a weird feeling on my skin
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Singapore,love it,"love this product, my skin is always dry and this is my favourite AM moisturizer to layer with a sunscreen! it’s not too thick and my skin absorbs it quickly"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Excellent Nighttime Cream for Oily Skin,"I use the Glow Recipe Pink Juice moisturizer in the daytime. At night, i like to use a ""thicker"" moisturizer, and this is the perfect one for me. The ingredients and the gel-cream feel of it, it hydrates my skin overnight and it does not clog my pores, it doesn't give me blackheads, it doesn't break me out, which is what every other cream moisturizer does to my oily skin. It is perfect for me, for nighttime use."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Game Changer,So far the best moisturizer I’ve ever purchased. Not just hype
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Best Moisturizer!!!,"I have tried a so many moisturizers and this one is amazing and my favorite. It goes on feeling wet but sinks very fast and does not feel sticky at all like the watermelon moisturizer. Additionally, it gives the skin this velvety feel to it."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,I have very very sensitive skin and it’s perfect for me. ❤️❤️❤️
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,Too pricey! But a good mosturizer,"Its good! Lightweight, non-greasy and keeps your skin hydrated! The only concern I have: its wayy to pricey!"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Lightweight. Perfect for sensitive skin,Great lightweight moisturizer. I use it 2x a day and I see a huge difference in my skin. It’s perfect for those hot days. I pair it with my summer Fridays sunscreen!
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Malaysia,Mrs,"Hello there my friend....please get this product, I am not promoting but this is magic! My skin felt plump just a minutes after application... If you don't believe, try to get the sample/ tester in any Sephora outlet available. Worth buying!"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,I never had problem with my skin!!! This cream break my face!!! This brand should be destroyed!! I am very disappointed!!! I hate you so much!
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,"i really liked this moisturizer, but it’s very expensive. good lightweight moisturizer for acne"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,A perfect morning moisturizer!,"I've used one jar already, and just got a refill!  I love that this product goes on light and doesn't clog pores.  I love using it for my AM moisturizer.  Also great for under-eye application before foundation/concealer!"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Best moisturizer I’ve ever used,A little goes a long way & my skin feels hydrated and bouncy well into the evening!
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,Half-empty or half-full?,"The package was half empty when I opened it, but the product does have a nice and not irritating smell, it didn’t give me any glow to my skin, more like a matte finish, although well absorbed."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,"I never leave reviews but have to for this guy! I've gone through 4 of these and it's really such a great moisturizer. I used to love thick creams, but this one is still super hydrating without having to be thick and doesn't leave a film on the skin like a lot of others do. It seriously does give a great glow, and does not break me out! Probably my most favorite face product I have tried (and I've tried like 50 other moisturizers)."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Too thin for my dry skin.,"A little does not go a long way with this moisturizer. While I do enjoy the plumping nature from the hyaluronic acid I feel that the consistency of this moisturizer is too thin. You need a good amount to apply to get results. Typically I go through a 1.7 oz moisturizer in 1-2 months... this on the other hand I am finished after two weeks! It isn't bad, but if the consistency was thicker and more concentrated then this would be my daily go to!"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,Refill pods for the win!,"This is honestly my first review, and I cannot say more good things about this product. Not only is it lightweight, hydrating and plumping but the refill pods will be the reason I continue to repurchase. 
There is SO MUCH waste in this industry, more companies need to offer refills!!"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,Third time purchasing (2nd refill),"I have dry acne prone skin and this has been a great sensitive moisturizer perfect of Canadian winters. I still used it throughout the summer. It’s a bit on the thicker side, but it’s way more hydrating than oily. It’s been the final step of my skincare routine for the past 4 months."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Not worth the hype,"This moisturizer broke me out a lot and did nothing for my skin - as far as plumping or giving it a glow. Although it’s lightweight, it takes some time to absorb and feels sticky. Will not be repurchasing."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,During the pandemic I began to get cystic acne. I have oily combo skin and I felt like any moisturizer I used just added to my breakouts. I was skeptical to try this because it’s thicker than the Pink Juice moisturizer (I used to use that daily and nightly prior to this). I l went to my local store and had a sample that I rubbed into the top of hands and was shocked at how smooth it was and how well it soaked into the skin. I bought it and fell in love. I personally just use it at night and stick to the Pink Juice for the day. I love how you can re-use the tub and just buy the pod to refill it. There’s not too much fragrance and it keeps my skin moisturized and I haven’t had any breakouts. I really love Glow Recipe! I’ve tried so many different brands that are at a higher price point and broke out so bad. A little goes a long way and the price isn’t bad at all. Love it ❤️
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,Staple :),"When layered with the avocado ceramide serum, it makes my skin feel velvety. I don’t even need primer before applying makeup because it’s so grabby and layers beautifully under makeup. Also, a huge fan of the refill pods!"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,I love how lightweight and hydrating it feels. Also leaves a glow but it’s not sticky or oily. I use it in the morning after my vitamin C
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,My current favorite moisturizer,I love Glow Recipe's products! This moisturizer is amazing.
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Made me break out,"I really wanted to like this, but every time I used it my skin would break out. I do struggle with hormonal acne and my skin is quite sensitive so if that is also you I’d be weary￼￼ of this moisturizer"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,Perfect,This moisturizer is lightweight and hydrating. My skin looks and feels amazing after using it. I’m almost done my 1st jar & will def be getting a refill pod!
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Great if you cleanse regularly,"Loved this, but it ran out so quickly. Also wish it came in a pump bottle so bacteria would be less of a thing. Would rather get the smaller version so bacteria is less of a concern. SMH brands still use pots for moisturizers."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Game changer in my routine!,Loveeeee this moisturizer. I use it under makeup with the green serum and man I love it! My makeup goes on better after letting this soak into my skin. My skin feels more moisturized and plump when using this!
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Not great,"Not much difference in skin, very light hydration
Smells good and goes on light but wasn’t a hit for me unfortunately"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Definitely NO: from a professional,"From a board certified dermatology PA: this is not worth your money. This brand has disappointed me with quantity, quality, and for its price just isn’t worth it. Tatcha and belief offer the best from this website."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,A must have skincare wise.,BUY RIGHT NOW. DOES EVERYTHING. Plumps and hydrates. One of my favorite moisturizers from my fave brand.
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,Actual amount is so little than the pakaging. Wouldn’t buy it again
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,"Sustainable, luxurious, and quintessentially G.R.","I purchased this product in June and have been using it since as my moisturizer every morning. It deeply hydrates, moisturizes well, and while I see no visible plumping benefits yet I also I also don’t expect that from this moisturizer alone within 3-4 months.

I have LOVED this product and hope they come out with refillable packaging for some of their other formulas over time…"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,Gave me bad breakouts,"I bought this one after the banana souffle one (which I loved) mysteriously disappeared from the site. This one is absolute trash, it breaks me out so bad and doesn't moisturize that well. Please bring banana souffle back!!!"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Ehhh… I would pass..,Honestly it does give a glow but I hate the sticky aftermath. Also makes my face feel a little itchy. Definitely not going to be purchasing again.
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Amazing! refill pod smaller than jar though,"This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever tried! Absolutely amazing! The whipped, bouncy gel cream texture is gorgeous and sinks right into the skin, and as is typical of Glow Recipe it gives a gorgeous, yet natural, glow to the skin. I was at first hesitant upon hearing “gel-cream”, as that is often a key word for oily skin and supremely lightweight formulas, but this is a true gel cream, not a barely there gel. It is perfect for my combination skin. It does have fragrance, so if you have a fragrance sensitivity/allergy, I would avoid, but if you are someone who is just not a big fan of fragrance in beauty products, I would totally recommend. I personally don’t like fragrance, but this one is barely there. It’s hard to describe, but I would say it smells subtly light and sweet, with the barest hint of plum, plus it fades quickly. Not as strong as that of the watermelon glow toner (although I actually love that fragrance as well). Only problem is it DOES NOT FILL UP THE PACKAGING! It’s great that Glow Recipe does refills for their products, but I honestly think it’s just a tactic to trick consumers into thinking they’re getting more product for the price, because the refill pod is significantly smaller than the glass jar. I would still fully recommend though, it’s worth all the hype!"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Singapore,Ms,I like how light it is and it smells nice. just on my 2nd day using it so need more time to see how good this moisturizer is. its abit on the pricey side.
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,PERFECT,This solved all my problems. I have terrible dry skin it cracks and flakes on the other hand my nose is oil city. Light fragrance that doesn’t irritate my skin. My skin never gets dry during the day or night!
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,It’s Okay,I wasn’t super wowed with this moisturizer. I love Glow Recipe but this moisturizer was under whelming all together. I wouldn’t recommend. It’s not the worst thing by any means but nothing special.
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,everyday moisturizer,"Love this product. I have oily/combo skin and even when my skin barrier is compromised, I can always count on this moisturizer to help with my redness and hydration."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,"I won’t be repurchasing. The packaging is much larger than the actual product. The actually pod with the moisturizer is about half the size of the container. Just too expensive for the amount you get in my opinion. There’s so many more moisturizers that you can get at a better price. Pictures next to the milk hydro grip for size reference. Cute packaging tho, I’d probably put other moisturizers in the container."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,"This was a really nice, hydrating, medium-weight moisturizer - it always felt great going on - but it just didn't agree with my skin. It didn't cause me to break out in widespread cystic acne or anything dramatic like that; it's more that when I stopped using it, my pores very mysteriously appeared much less congested. Like, the vibes I was getting from my skin were better - clearer! - when this wasn't in my routine. I used the whole jar - which is super pretty, by the way - twice a day every day, and went through it in 3-ish months. The scent was fine, if not a little on the sweet side. I wish my face liked this more, honestly. The refill pods look so convenient."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Not impressed,Not impressed. Not for dry skin as description reads. Overated. Is not moisturizing and does not absorb well. Has a tacky feeling. Maybe for oily or combination skin. My face does not feel hydrated. Will be returning.
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Malaysia,Mediocre,I don't hate it but I also don't love it. I only use this at night because it's quite heavy to use in the morning for my combination skin. Sometimes I woke up with oily skin in the morning when I use this. I still prefer Tatcha the water cream but the price is killing me.
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Left skin very oily,"While it did leave my skin softer, it also left it oiler than ever. Not good for combo/oily skin."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Not for dry skin,"I wanted to try something new for the summer to see if maybe I can have a bit more moisture. The creamy lightweight texture and hyaluronic acid drew me in. But, the light texture also translated into a cream that immediately gets absorbed and left my skin begging for more."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 20ml,I really like this moisturizer. I got the small size to try it out after the laniege moisturizer reformulation which did not work for me. I have dry skin and this keeps me moisturized all day. I haven’t noticed a smell. I think I’ve found my replacement and will be purchasing the larger size once I’m out
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,One of the best moisturizers I’ve ever used! Smells so amazing and leaves my skin feeling super soft and hydrated. And the refillable pods are soooo genius! Love this so much!
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Great cream,"This moisturizer feels light on the skin, not heavy as some are. Absorbs quickly. I use AM & PM."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,amazing!!,I got this in the trendmood box and was waiting to finish my Tatcha Water Cream I had opened before I started this. I just was tired of the water cream not leaving my skin feeling as moisturized as I liked so I just now went ahead and opened this. Instantly this felt like heaven on my skin and I had to come leave a review. It feels so luxurious and smoothing instantly. Such an amazing feeling and experience that I will continue to use this and be happy to do my skincare now. I’m not getting paid to say this and obviously didn’t get this product free. I might even like this better than the dewy skin which is crazy to me. It even has a nice light scent. Instant love and you can feel the hylauronic acid working right away as far as plumping the skin.
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Surprised.,"I’m surprised by the reviews on this. I first tried this moisturizer in the Glow Recipe X Mikayla Kit and really really liked it. It’s creamy but also gel like, it’s not heavy or greasy and it feels good on the skin. I have dehydrated skin that is acne prone and I never break out from glow recipe products. I feel like this product keeps my skin nicely balanced."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,"meh, skip it and get a better one",I dont know why everyone rated it so high as it is nothing compared to other products I've bought at the same price point. lots of other brands at the same price with a way better product.
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,GET IT!,My skin is very sensitive and breaks out to pretty much everything. My skin is doing really good with Glow recipe.It leaves my skin with an excellent glow!
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Mousse Light-No smell,"very much like a mousse consistency, more on the liquid side than thick cream. Good glow from it too"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,I received this product that I've used many times in the past opened. The seal was broken 1/2 the product was missing.  I am not comfortable using this product knowing it was either not package correctly or was returned to the store for resale.
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,No difference,Finished the one I purchased and honestly saw now difference in my skin
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Singapore,Great for oily / combo / sensitive skin ,"I have combination as well as sensitive skin, with occasional rosacea flares. This product is nourishing enough to hydrate, but lightweight enough to not feel like it’s sitting on top of my skin. It is a gel-like texture, which is perfect for Singapore’s humid weather. I will continue to repurchase this. "
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,awesome,Beautiful product. Gives skin glow and good for oily skin
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Great moisturizer,"The formula is not too thick & feels great on my face and neck, I really like it!"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Just meh,This product was very disappointing. I have combo skin and it left me feeling super dry by the end of the day. It also made my foundation weird.
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 20ml,My least favorite from glow recipe. I do not recommend.
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,This was super sticky for me even after a few hours. I felt like my face was dirty and I didn’t seem to be getting any benefits from it.
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,Love love love! I am 45 and my skin has changed. I had to move on from what I was using and landed on this. I don’t feel a slick of product in my face like other age appropriate daily moisturizers.
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,LOOK AWAY,"Why anyone chooses to invest their money into this brand is beyond me. I got this as a free sample because I was thinking about purchasing the bigger size and I believe the sample is God-sent because my money would have gone in the trash if I would have tried the bigger size without trying the sample first. This feels like something a kid would use. It pills under makeup and even on it's own. It is very VERY VERY sticky. You really have to put some effort to relieve it into the skin. Even after going into the skin, it remains sticky even after drying. I would not recommend. -10/10."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,the photo says it all,"the photo says it all, it left a beautiful glow. it does have a scent too it but a pleasant one and it does not affect the skin well mine didn’t…"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glass Skin,"I absolutely love this stuff. I started using it about two month ago, and I’ve repurchased. This is by far one of my favourite moisturizers. It’s lightweight, not greasy. It’s gives your skin that glass skin glow. I use this with a few other glow recipe products and it works well with them. No pilling, or uneven application. I have pretty dry skin, to the point of flaking and I haven’t had an issue since I starting using this product."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,"this is a love
fragrance 10/10
texture 10/10
hydration 10/10

will order it again"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 20ml,"This product is just average. It smells nice & definitely plumps my skin, but I don’t feel like it hydrates my skin for an extended period of time. I find myself using more product than I would normally use just to feel satisfied with the hydration of my skin. 

Also, beware of air bubbles! When I took off the inner protective lid, an air bubble popped and revealed the jar was only 3/4 full. See attached photo. 

Overall, if you have combo skin this might work for you, but personally I prefer other moisturizers for my drier skin."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,"I use this along with the Watermelon serum and it’s been a wonderful combination for my sensitive, borderline dry skin! It’s light and smells amazing. No breakouts, my makeup stays on better. Love this cream!"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Not for me,"Takes quite a long time to absorb into the skin and remains sticky. I will only be using this at night and not under makeup because it doesn't work well with my foundation. I like the fact that it is refillable, but the original canister is made with a ton of plastic--lots of unused space. Eco-friendly in name only, imo."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Just Okay,"I have dry skin but not super dry and this stuff was not moisturizing enough. I think this product is most suitable for someone with oily skin. It sank into my skin instantly and never broke me out, but it just wasn’t great. I wouldn’t repurchase this for me but I can see how it works for others. I love that it is refillable."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,i adore this moisturizer :) it’s not thick and oily but still gives my skin a good amount of moisture. it doesn’t feel heavy and makes my skin look and feel really nice!!
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,"I really wanted to like this product because I LOVE so many of Glow Recipe’s products, but unfortunately it broke me out. The texture is so soft and it definitely gave my skin a more plumped appearance so I’m sad that this didn’t work for me. I would definitely suggest trying a sample or purchasing a mini size before committing to the full size of you have sensitive skin!"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,SO GLOWY!!,Feels so good on my skin and makes it so glowy!! Love!!
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,holy grail for oily/combo skin,"pretty nice moisturizer. smells great, goes on and leaves a nice finish. goes on my face with about everything i could try with no pilling. highly recommend for anyone with combo or oily skin because it is a pretty light moisturizer."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,"Must have for sensitive, uneven and combo skin","I am a skincare freak and this is now my staple moisturizer!!! My skin is very very sensitive, uneven and combination. I don’t usually have breakouts but if I get it rated look out! This is a wonderful moisturizer, it’s light, dewy and feels like silk! Worth every penny, I plan on trying to dew drops next"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 20ml,This is AH-MAZING!! It replenished my skin & it’s so plump. I’m over 40 & I highly recommend this for aging skin!
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,This product is magic!,"I looooooove this product. I’m already on my second refill of this product, and I know it will stick with me for a whileee. I have normal-dry skin, and rosacea, and this product is magic!! I use this in the morning with the ceramide serum from the same brand, and this works wonders, leaves your skin dewy, naturally glowy and healthy! Honestly worth the money!! Packs a punch!"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Singapore,amazing!,"this moisturiser is super good!! was really excited to try this out as it was highly raved about and it did not disappoint!! works well with the dew drops! 
"
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Not for oily skin!,"This is not for oily skin! This is a thick oil based moisturizer that is made for dry skin. This is also a mini size, so don’t think you are getting a ton of product. I love this moisturizer because I have extremely dry skin and this makes my skin feel hydrated. It’s worth the price for the full size for me, and I can’t wait to try it in the winter when my skin is even dryer than normal."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 20ml,It’s not that great as it seems. Seems like a dream to be perfect as it seems but it’s not quite moisturizing. It feels like it but then it’s not… honestly there’s a better moisturizer out there but this isn’t it.
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,love it!,love this. it leaves such a beautiful finish on the skin. i forgot that i wanted to buy a refill of it u tok writing this review. leaves your skin glowy and hydrated and it is such a beautiful texture
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,Obsessed with this moisturizer! I use it everyday before I put on my foundation & I love it! It goes on so smooth & leaves your fave feeling hydrated all day long!
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,Breakout in a bottle!!!,The absolute worst not for my dry skin girlies at all :(( so disappointed
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Moisture lasts!,"This product is small!  I have dry and reactive skin. It feels amazing for hours after applying. It is on the thicker side, so I don’t use it every day."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 20ml,"Decent but even the mini size was a bit expensive for an okay product. Definitely moisturizes, but has an almost oily aspect to it. But overall feels good. Don't think I will repurchase."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,Keeps my face smooth I have acne and dry sensitive skin. The moisturizer gives your face a glow.
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,must by for dry skin,"Amazing hydration! I like the way it plumps my skin, also gives a dewy look. I have a dry skin, this gives me a super hydrated skin."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Fresh and Hydrating!,"I love this moisturizer! I use it under the watermelon glow sunscreen, and the dewy glow you get is so nice. I have combo skin, so it helps to keep my face hydrated, but also doesn’t make my skin look oily. I also live in a humid/hot area (South Texas,) but it really keeps my face hydrated all day and not too oily. It has a light scent, which I like, it’s very “fresh.” Only reason I gave it four stars is because I wish it helped with dark spots, instead of having to buy something else to use with it and making sure to find the right combo. But I’ll more than likely try their brightening serum, since both products I have purchased from them have really done a good job for my skin."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,NEW STAPLE,"ok, have been using Hyaluronic serums for a long time - and I wasnt sure how i would incorporate this as im used to using a liquid serum for my Hyaluronic step. 
 im obsessed with this. I can now layer my peptide serum/retinols/niacinamide serums underneath, then I use this ultra plumping and hydrating hyaluronic cream over the top which is a little more nourishing than a straight Hyaluronic serum. In winter I follow with an oil-based cream and a face oil over the top of this as the Glow Recipe Hyaluronic Cream is more like a gel moisuriser. Am delighted with this product, will be refilling for sure."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,Face lift in a bottle! Lasting luster & immediate results!
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,Canada,Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream - 50ml,Love this! Very cooling and calming. Great moisture! Felt moisture for more than 24 hours after!
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,Run and Get it,"Ohhh em gee. I love this. It feels gel like and glides like water over the skin but then as you’re spreading it starts to feel thicker leaving a nice dewy look. I find their pink juice moisturizer too light for me and I don’t have dry skin. This one feels so good, moisturizing and hydrating without being heavy."
GLOW RECIPE-Plum Plump Hyaluronic Cream,USA,meh. overrated?,"This stuff was alright. It feels nice, but was a little too lightweight for me and I’ve been breaking out a bunch since using it for a month or so (it might have to do with me switching out cleansers though). I also went through it so quickly I feel like I didn’t really get my moneys worth!"
FRESH-Best Of Beauty Bundle (Christmas Limited Edition),Australia,A nice gift set,If you enjoy the scent of rose and need hydration this is for you. I didn't find it made any real difference to my acne but it's natural and it's just rose/fruit and so I'm not surprised. I like to store the toner in the fridge for the morning so its nice and cold before I start my skincare routine. 
FRESH-Best Of Beauty Bundle (Christmas Limited Edition),Malaysia,Great Product,I’ve been eyeing fresh products but too expensive to buy the real size ones. So i bought the christmas bundle just to see wether the products suit my skin or not and turned out they do. The toner is gentle but does the work. The moisturiser is non sticky and makes your skin hydrated. The face wash makes my skin smoother. All in all they are good combinations. Just i wish the serum is included in this bundle
FRESH-Best Of Beauty Bundle (Christmas Limited Edition),Malaysia,Suitable to my combination skin,"Bought this to try on Fresh products. surprisingly it works well with my combination skin. the dry cheeks are well hydrated while the oily T-zone is no longer oily, but well hydrated too. even my husband says my skin feels softer & moist. looking forward to buy the larger size soon "

CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel,Singapore,average ,I bought this because of the good reviews but it has a slight tacky finish due to the high dimethicone and feels like you have a film on your face. It may have also broke me out and I wouldn’t recommend it but ymmv
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel,Malaysia,It was refreshing,"I have oily to combination skin and my dry area is also very dry but after using this product for a week, I am less oily and less dry.

CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel,Singapore,okay but nothing special ,The formula is good and plain but it doesn’t do anything for my combi skin. it would be great for sensitive acne prone skin I Guess.

CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge 100H Auto-Replenishing Hydrator Moisturiser,Singapore,simple gel based moisturizer ,"Don't think it really can serve 100 hour of hydration as advertised. The product will be off your face in probably max 12 hour (when you wash your face). Nonetheless it is still quite a decent moisturizer. it is the gel kind of moisturizer, smooth to apply on your skin, and has a much lighter texture as compared to other moisturizer cream. I use it before my makeup and it is working fine for me. However if you have very dry skin, then maybe this will not be moisturizing enough for you. I have combination oily skin."

CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge 100H Auto-Replenishing Hydrator Moisturiser,USA,"Great, straightforward moisturizer","I love this moisturizer and have been using it for years (I used the previous version before, I think it was 72 hour rather than 100). It has a great gel texture that is very moisturizing but not at all oily or greasy. I have acne prone, combination skin and this has never made me breakout. I also use a prescription retinol (tretinoin) at night which is very drying and this provides great hydration. I use this at night and the Clinique Dramatically Different Gel in the morning and I would highly recommend both, especially if you're using other topicals in the morning (vitamin c serum, etc.) and at night (retinol, etc.) since these are just straightforward moisturizers that won't counteract with the rest of your skincare."

CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge 100H Auto-Replenishing Hydrator Moisturiser,USA,Great For Combination Oily Skin,"Ran out of my usual face moisturizer so I grabbed this mini size. I've used this before so I knew this would work well with my skin. I'm 49 and I still have combination oily skin and prone to small breakouts. This moisturizer is good for someone with oily skin. I don't get pimples and it still gives me the moisture my skin needs. Because it's a gel formula, you may need a little more because of the consistency and it spreads out into a thin layer. Once it dries you can't feel that you have anything on your skin which is good for hot humid climates. I have in the past used this with a sheer foundation and it didn't pill. Although I can't speak for all foundations. Definitely would recommend this because it is a great moisturizer and within a good price point."

I thought because it has such mighty claims about how moisturizing it is that it would be a thick cream, but no, it’s a light gel like texture. This would be the perfect moisturizer for oily skinned gals. OILY DOES NOT MEAN HYDRATED! Also, using this moisturizer on damp skin is key. I like to take it even further and will spray rose water after this. I wake up with plump youthful skin."
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge 100H Auto-Replenishing Hydrator Moisturiser,USA,best for acne prone and sensitive skin!,"I freaking love this moisturizer. This moisturizer and Cerave’s are the only ones that don’t break my sensitive, acne prone skin out. I’m very picky on what I use for obvious reasons, but this works and keeps my skin hydrated and soft. Really helps with acne because dryness leads to more pimples. I absolutely love it, would highly recommend to any acne prone/sensitive girlies and guys."

Alot of breakouts happened! Initially i tought it could be due to other skincares, but when i stopped using it, my acne all disappeared, only to return when i reused the cream! "
SK-II-Skinpower Airy Milky Lotion,Malaysia,sk2,Have used many moisturizers. This is one of the best moisturizers. The newly improved formula is better and the lotion is quickly absorbed into the skin
SK-II-Skinpower Airy Milky Lotion,Singapore,miss,"Due to the review i read, i decided to try this.  Though this is a bit pricey but i was able to save as i brought this product during promotion.  I love this as it is easily absorb to my skin. My skin is so smooth"

SK-II-Skinpower Airy Milky Lotion,Australia,Handy quality products ,"This feels great when applying and leaves the hair feeling soft. If you have an irritated scalp, you may feel some itching still, it doesn’t work on the scalp as much as the hair but if your scalp is not irritated, it won’t set it off."
SK-II-Skinpower Airy Milky Lotion,Singapore,skII cream,i love the RNA type works on my skin so i have no choice but to change to this skinpower airy milky same feel very light but the effect is different for me i still love the RNA. overall love skII products
SK-II-Skinpower Airy Milky Lotion,Singapore,Good moisturiser ,"Acts as moisturiser for both day and night use.

SK-II-Skinpower Airy Milky Lotion,Australia,different to rna ,"I thought this was the same as the rna airily milky lotion, it is a bit thicker than rna, though it still leaves your skin feeling hydrated and fresh, overall still a good product "
SK-II-Skinpower Airy Milky Lotion,Singapore,Its always sold out online,"The fact that this always sells out online should speak for itself, I have used this alot. And my skin has seen improvements with it."
SK-II-Skinpower Airy Milky Lotion,Australia,smells divine,"I love the smell firstly. It smells so good. My sensitive skin has calmed down a lot since switching back to SK. I would say it is a little on the lighter side and could use another layer of night cream at night. Though, during the day and for the up coming summer it’s perfect. "
SK-II-Skinpower Cream,Singapore,Glowing in the morning,"As $$$ expensive it was, it really works. The cream absorbed into the face skin, not stick and marking in your pillow sheet. Glowing in the next morning."
SK-II-Skinpower Cream,Singapore,My day & night cream!,I use this for my day and night regime. Day time I apply it lesser and night time thicker. I use this with skin power essence. Both products work perfectly on me. I would recommend this range for mature skin. You see results over 2 weeks. 
SK-II-Skinpower Cream,Singapore,Not bad,"I prefer the smell of the previous cream (RNA cream) which I have used it for years.. Was upset when they changed to skinpower cream, where I initially found the smell to be overpowering and was afraid that my skin type (sensitive) wouldn’t be able to adapt to it. I took a few months’ break from this cream cause I was bothered by the smell. Now that I’m back using the cream, I would say that I’ve gotten used to the smell, and I feel like the cream works the same as RNA. Worth trying if u really loved the RNA cream and couldn’t find any replacement for that!"
SK-II-Skinpower Cream,Singapore,rich,"Used this as a night cream. Texture is very rich and thick. You’ll look and feel bouncy, smooth and glow the next day after cleanse. Although it feels sticky overnight but it supposed to be hydrate your face especially in an aircond room."
SK-II-Skinpower Cream,Singapore,moisturize!,"I really prefer this one compare to SKII Airy Milk Lotion, I feel like the effect of it is much more longer and effective not that the other one is not good I just prefer this one. "
SK-II-Skinpower Cream,Malaysia,great moisturizer cream,"I tend to shy away from skin-whitening products 
cause it doesn’t sit well with my sensitive skin. But for the sake of this SK-II review, I stuck my neck out and tried SK-II’s Skinpower cream which is made with Japanese plum extract, a fruit known for its antioxidant and anti-glycation properties. Antioxidants are also great for sensitive skin like mine, because they help to protect it against free radicals that can damage skin cells and cause inflammation."
SK-II-Skinpower Cream,Singapore, power cream!,"From the first day you use this cream, you can feel right away that your skin became softer, smoother and hydrated. What i love about this cream is that its not oily. "
SK-II-Skinpower Cream,Malaysia,Not suitable for combination skin ,First time using it. It smells good and texture is buttery. I have combination skin and I feel that it is too oily for me. It may work better on dry skin. 
SK-II-Skinpower Cream,Singapore,Nice Anti Aging Cream,"This is a nice anti aging cream. Texture is very buttery and moisturizing. However, the perfume smells a bit strong."
SK-II-Skinpower Cream,Australia,like it,"I’ve always been using SK-II essence. But giving I’m not getting younger I thought I will add on this SK-II cream too. I really do feel like this has made a difference in my skin conditions over time, compared to other skin products that might make you feel good the next day but actually does nothing in the long run. And it’s not too thick or thin it’s just right. "
SK-II-Skinpower Cream,Australia,Mrs,"I am not able to use the product as the jar that i bought is empty , been trying to contact the store and head ofc.sephora highpoint for some reason its close today."
SK-II-Skinpower Cream,Australia,Ms,"Disappointing. I been using SK II for about 8-9 years or so, while the RNA had a slight smell (fragrance) at least it was bearable...
this new SKINPOWER even more LOADED with fragrance, the strong parfume scent is unbearable, I don’t get it, here we are in 2021 while skincare try to use less and less fragrance, and yet SK II added more fragrance which can be irritant for some people. The scent of the parfumé stays on your face after severals hours....(scary) 
I really don’t get it, RNA was a cult product, one of the best selling moisturiser... and I’m sure many of us (that been using it for a long time feel redundant and will move to other brands / looking for other alternatives face moisturiser) if it ain’t broke don’t fix it 

"
SK-II-Skinpower Cream,Singapore,Ms,"I like this product, my facial skin looks good after using it"
SK-II-Skinpower Cream,Australia,Amazing for your skin ,"If you ever wanted youthful, hydrated skin, then skinpower cream is the way to go ! It helps moisturise my skin, and makes underneath my eyes less puffy. You can put primer over it, no problems ! "
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Harness the Power of Okinawa & Japanese Botanicals,"Tatcha's Dewy Skin Cream contains healthy nutrients like Japanese Purple Rice, Okinawa Algae Blend, and Hyaluronic Acid– all of which combine to attract water and help replenish the skin’s moisture barrier while plumping it. I lived on Okinawa for 10 years. Raised my children there. We all had a wonderful skin, bathing in the East China Sea, eating the food of the earth. We all stopped aging for 10 full years. I returned to United States and my skin began aging... quickly Pollution, water, stress... It wasn't until I discovered Tatcha, particularly the purple line with the purple rice wash, dewy cream, and Dewy serum that I saw a difference. I literally feel and look different."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,Amazing,Very gentle on the skin but very moisturizing. I have sensitive skin and have tried so many others. This is the only one for me!
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,"Been using for 4 months, never using anything else",Sad to see all the negative reviews of this moisturizer.  This is the best cream I've ever used. It's aided me in getting my glass skin and keeps me from being a dry horrible mess. I have noticed less wrinkles and can feel the plumpness on my skin due to how much it hydrates me. She is a staple for me and I honestly cannot see myself deviating and trying another product.   This product is what my skin has been looking for!
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,"Amazing, best feeling cream","This is everything I would want in a moisturizer - heavenly soft and REALLY plumping, keeps skin feeling perfect for probably 24 hours if I left it long enough, smells divine, has a great list of ingredients for dry skin, AND you barely need a small dot to cover the whole face.
The issue: I just hate how expensive it is, but I will definitely give up and buy it as soon as it runs out. I will miss the feeling too much. Curses, in the best way, Tatcha, you absolutely live up to the hype."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,No for me,It’s a BIG NO for me. My face has NEVER broken out like this. This was four days of trying it out…
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Made me breakout,This product made me breakout and develop texture all over my forehead. I’ve never had this happen with any other product my skin is not even sensitive. I think it has to do with the very strong fragrance  this product contains. Not very hydrating either I would apply it in the night and wake up with super dry skin in the morning I would have to moisturize immediately after waking up. For the price point it’s not worth there are better products out there way cheaper as well. The “glow” this product gives you is just borderline greasy and just emphasized my texture
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,lovely glow but too much fragrance for me,"The scent was pretty strong, I prefer my skincare to be fragrance free because it's so unnecessary for the face. I liked the texture and it absorbs quickly, definitely made my skin bright and glowy. A little out of my budget to buy though (I got the birthday gift lol)"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Cheap dose of good marketing,"Very tempting pretty because of lavender smells and shiny jar but the product is just as cheap as the packaging. (Plastic gold spoon on top and called it anti bacteria… eye roll) 
This makes my skin (which is not even sensitive) brea out. It’s very oily feeling and clogs pours. Just not for me. I didn’t even use most of it. It was a waist and I am sad."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,Strong smell,"If you’re sensitive to scented face creams, this product definitely is not recommended! I’ve got the sample to try on and the first thing that bothered me after application was the strong smell! 
Also I like to layer my moisturizer two three times to feel extra hydration but definitely not recommended for this product as it kinda peels of after reapplication."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Tatcha The Dewy Skin Cream - 50ml,"Switched from the Water cream and I'm not looking back. I have very oily acne pitted skin, and the Water cream made my skin texture look rougher. I realized I needed more mousture so switched to this. Been using for a week and no breakouts or whiteheads, and it feels more hydrating than the Water Cream. It's rich, but doesn't feel like it's sitting on uour skin or suffocating your pores. My new staple."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Expensive but worth it for dry sensitive skin,"I got a sample of this for my birthday gift and let me tell you this worked wonders for my dry sensitive skin. After just a few days my skin was started to feel better, was less sensitive, wasn’t flaky like it usually was and my skin also felt smoother. I would warn my oily skin queens that this version of the cream isn’t for you. And if you don’t like feeling a slight residue on your face after applying creams then you also probably wouldn’t like this either. For my oil skin girls I would recommend the water cream but if you’re a dry skin girl like me I apologize to your wallet and I say run don’t walk.wasmoother."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Malaysia,ok product,Effectiveness on average end compared to other brands bought frm Sephora that’s richer and creamier for dry air conditioned nights in. Would use it for day without makeup 
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Holy Grail moisturizer for Dry skin!,"This has been my HG moisturizer for the last 5 years. I’ve tried hundreds, and none have been as hydrating or plumping for my dry, 36 year old skin as this. I wouldn’t recommend this for oily skin types as it is VERY hydrating
 and leaves a very dewy finish. I love the fragrance, but if you’re sensitive to it this also might not be for you. I will never stray from this moisturizer!"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,Probably the best stuff ive put on my skin,"This cream feels so good when applying to the face, it is nice and thick and sinks in easily to the skin. It has a light, fresh smell, but it goes away quickly. It sits really well underneath all my makeup and it helps my skin look bouncy and fresh at the end of the day, even with loads of makeup on.  I have defiantly seen a change in my skin hydration and texture as well as how long my makeup is lasting and how much better it looks in general"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,Only okay for dry skin,"I have pretty dry skin and I found that this wasnt enough for me especially since it's been raved about as the HG for dry skin. It does go on quite nicely and feels luxurious but I found my skin felt tight and dry a short while later.

I wouldn't repurchase and I'll continue to search for a better moisturizer for dry skin."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Pretty,I have sensitive acne prone skin and I love the indigo serum cream so much so I wanted to use them together! But unfortunately it stings my skin. I am continuing to use it because it feels luxurious and smells so nice!
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Horrible,Broke me out like a teenager going through puberty
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,It's just alright,"I received a mini size for my birthday from Sephora, so naturally I was so excited to try out Tatcha! The cream itself is a wonderful velvety consistency- BUT it was not all that. I have tried out several different creams as I work in the skincare industry and other than the consistency, I didn't see all the hype. I HAD to apply this product twice, & I don't really see how this is for dry skin as it wasn't all that moisturizing. I have normal skin with combo T Zone & my T zone was drier than usual.. I also have sensitive skin and I had NO problems using this cream. I would give it a try if your on the fence but wouldn't add to my routine."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,bought it after bday sample it was that good,"I got this product as a mini-sized for my birthday gift, I absolutely LOVE it !! I am 51 and have seen a huge difference in my skin after 2 months, my fine lines are gone no joke, especially under my eyes. I have super sensitive skin (due to cancer) and no issues with it at all , I ever bought it after it ran out , some one on a huge budget , its a little pricey but its worth it ."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,A must-have in my routine,"After using this product 2 weeks, I've noticed my skin more hydrated and smooth and I am 46. I love this product!"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Def recommend,"So I got the little sample size in one of the birthday gift things and I am HOOKED on this. It makes my face feel so soft and makes it look so glowy! The only downside is that it's really moisturizing and I have oily skin so I sometimes have to dab off excess oil. Def recommend this and its matching cleanser. Take it from the teenager lol

*Ik this review says I'm 54+, but I'm not.*"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Irritated my skin,"I wanted to love this so much! It has a nice smell that’s not over powering, and an amazing consistency. It melts in your skin and moisturizes…. But it irritated my skin too much."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,Amazing product,A must have for winter season. The only moisturizer that worked to fight off the dry climate in Alberta.
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,A must have in my routine,After using this product for last few weeks results are amazing…
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,AMAZING! for *dry* skin.,"this stuff is a holy grail product, for people like me who have dry skin. i’ve heard it really doesn’t work for oily and combo skin! i tried tatcha’s other moisturizer (in the green bottle) and it broke me out. turns out, it’s for oily/combo skin! but this one, it works wonders for me. i have had so many people ask me what my skin care routine is and it’s just this and a cleanser. the price tag is hefty but it lasts FOREVERRRR and a little goes a loooong way. 10/10 recommend!"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Broke Me Out Like A Teenager,I’ve always been curious about this product and it was an investment but I love the scent and I’m such a sucker for packaging so I thought it’d be worth it. It completely broke me out with cystic acne and whiteheads. Boo
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Dry skin remedy!,"I’m African American with eczema dry type skin & this is the moisturizer for me! With my routine of cleansing & exfoliating, this works very well. Smells good and does take some rubbing into the skin. Wahla! Works wonders!"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Love it!!,"Love this moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and there is no irritation. I am in my late 30’s and needed something more thirst quenching for my “not so young skin” anymore. This stuff hydrates very well and a little bit goes a long way. Especially with the applicator tool, it helps to not waste. Well worth the money in my opinion."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Leaves a white residue and is thin. I'd pass !,I have combination skin with dryness around my forehead and cheeks. I really wanted to like this product but felt it was too thin and didn't provide enough coverage. My skin would be dry after a few hours and I'd have to reapply. It also leaves a white residue on your face if you don't take the time to get the product in your skin. Overall I didn't feel like it was worth the price.
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Causes break outs,"Moisturizing but my face had a continuous break outs. I have since pushed it aside and went back to my tried and trues. Also found the fragrance pretty strong. Sad, I wanted to love this."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Everything for me.,"35 years old with hormonal acne, texture/scarring and the starting of fine lines. This is my holy grail product for the last 2 years. I’ve never broken out from it, the scent/fragrance doesn’t bother me or cause irritation, and besides the instant glow the cream gives, the long-term hydration is amazing. I used to have dehydrated skin that led to more acne. This is perfect for my skin type. (Not dry or oily). Even the tops of my hands look younger from wiping what’s left on them."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,I use only morning times.,I love this Cream. Very helpful with a wrinkle on my face. Recover so fast look like in 7 days after I used it.
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,I love this stuff,"I have dry skin. I’m not super acne prone, but it is very sensitive. I got this for a birthday gift and WOW I love it. I’m gonna have to buy the full size. It leaves my skin plump and glowy with the smallest amount. 10/10 from me."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Disappointing.,"I have combination skin and no acne issues for background. It has a subtle lavender smell. However, it didn't really moisturize my skin. It felt like it just sat on top of it and pilled up over the day. I use an eczema therepy drugstore ointment for my son, and it leaves my skin feeling exactly like moisturizer does. I was disappointed with Tatcha. I really wanted to like it."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Tatcha The Dewy Skin Cream - 50ml,Got it as a birthday freebie but it gave my hands an instant rash. It also felt like a burning sensation on my face I had to wash it off.
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Yuk!,"I normally have oily skin, but it was become very dry after using tretinoin. So I tried a small sample of this. Just using a tiny bit made my face super greasy! Like spreading butter or Crisco on your face. It doesn’t soak in. I pressed a kleenex to my face and it hung there! Also it’s very shiny! Pass."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Good moisturizer,"I love it , good moisturizer 
But the price hurts my pocket :("
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Worth every penny,My holy grail product. I can literally feel the moisturizer being washed away the next morning; it’s so thick and creamy. I wear a mask 12+ hours a day in a very dry hospital and this makes my face feel SO moisturized. Worth every penny
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,Tatcha The Dewy Skin Cream - 50ml,Just apply a pea size all over the face and neck. Feels super soft and smooth!
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Greasy feeling,"I used a tiny bit more than the pea sized amount which, I am assuming,  is why my face felt so extremely greasy. I gave it some time to absorb but in the end I just wanted to wipe it off. If you’re going to spend this much money I recommend Dr Jart instead. The plastic looking container made it feel more cheap, too. First impression was very unimpressed, but note that this is based on my first use. Personally, I don’t think I’ll return to this brand."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,"Feels great, but have some doubts","When first applying, my skin just drinks this in. I use as instructed. I only use a Pearl sized amount and apply it like a foundation. That tiny amount provides maximum moisture. It’s not too heavy or too oily when applied this way. Think of the size of a sweet pea. That’s about how much I use per application. The downside, in tandem with using this product with the other Tatcha Dewy skin products, I seem to be getting a negative reaction. I notice a burning sensation just minutes after applying the product. I also notice slight oiliness on my nose. If it weren’t for the irritants and the golf ball sized air pocket in the gratitude sized container (which makes me feel like it’s a rip off) I would recommend."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Best moisturizer I have ever used-but that price..,"I absolutely love this moisturizer, it is the best I have ever used on my dry skin. Literally will leave your face feeling silky smooth! Price is a lot, I keep buying the minis, I need to just splurge for reg size."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,Price Hurts My Soul,Listen. I love buying useless things and I love splurging. And this works so well for me you'd think I'd have no problem repurchasing something so useful but I really do. Does it smell amazing? Yup. Does it moisturize my dry skin just the right amount without drenching me in grease? Yup. Does it pill and look icky over other products? Nope. Does it prevent bumpy forehead acne unlike other moisturizers? Yes it does. Does it make my skin brighter? For sure. But the price man!!!!!!!!!! I have really expensive serums and essences but for whatever reason I cannot justify buying this again. I use a moisturizer from Avene now and even that isn't crazy cheap but I just cannot justify spending this much on this cream. Would I recommend the product itself? Yes I would.
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Great for moisturizing and reducing redness,"I bought this not feeling too sure if it would deliver—but it seriously does. It is moisturizing (like many others), but the super-power here for me is how much it reduces redness from my skin. It’s absolutely amazing."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Too freaking pricey,"It's a good product, but the packaging is made heavy like the actual tin feels heavy but the amount of product they give is sooo little. I feel like I'm getting ripped off, and ngl for this price the product has to be made of good or freaking silver but it's not so it's pretty overpriced for a good product."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,YOU NEED THIS IF YOU HAVE DRY SKIN.,"If you have oily skin definitely pass. My skin is extremely dry, I rarely ever see oil on my face. I also Don’t have the type of skin to get breakouts or pimples. I am a skin care junkie and With other moisturizers my skin would feel a little better but still a little rough. This is the only moisturizer that leaves my skin actually soft and glowy. Been using this for over 2 years.  It is definitely on the heavier side and I can see why people with oily skin might hate this. If you have normal skin use a small amount. If you have extremely dry skin like me, using more pays off, but still a little goes a long way. I usually Apply a good amount before bed and wake up in the morning with beautiful skin. Keep in mind guys you need to get what works with your skin and companies make different items to suit your needs. Any light moisturizer that has a water base is perfect for oily skin. Any dewy glowy heavy cream is great for dry :)"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,I love it!,I received a sample as a bday gift and It’s amazing. I have mature dry skin and it keeps my skin hydrated all day long. It reminds me so much to my number one moisturizer (Belif moisturizing bomb)
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,This is a must have!! See it for yourself!!!,I love the result after using this moisturizer in a week.
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Tatcha The Dewy Skin Cream - 50ml,"This is great IF you have dry skin, but if you have oily skip it."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Tatcha The Dewy Skin Cream - 50ml,I receive this product as a Birthday gift and all i can say is omG what a great product i love it
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Burns,I received this tatcha moisturizer as a free bday gift. The texture is thick and I have oily skin so it was a instant no and then it burns really bad. Wouldn’t recommend
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Singapore,Pricy,the price keeps increasing every 6 months. it used to be below 100sgd. probably will find a more affordable alternative soon because i quite like the dewiness it gives my skin
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,Absolutely Amazing!,"Great for combo + dry skin! At first, the product feels tacky but it quickly sinks into your skin, leaving a smooth finish. Got the sample size for my birthday, so the only downside of this product is the price :("
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,Thick Sticky Balm,"This ""cream"" is more of a sticky balm than a smooth cream.It goes on tacky and stays tacky. It is thick and gooey and for the price? No thanks"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,"If you want to treat yourself, this is it!","I’ve been using this moisturizer for two months now and I’ve noticed the improvements to my skin recently. I use this moisturizer after the Tatcha rice wash cleanser but only have been using these at night. it doesn’t feel like it sits on top of my skin and it’s very breathable. I’ve noticed my skin is smoother now and it feels more elastic in a way, like it feels fuller when I touch my face (I guess that’s the plumping part of the name). I justified the price point of this product as a “treat myself” purchase, sometimes just having something with the label “luxury” helps with actually using the products and having a better routine for myself, but in the end I feel it’s very much worth the price. For as little as I use each night, I imagine this will last me a long time and it seems to have really turned my skin around."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,"Love, perfection 💕 worth every cent. Get wash 2","AMAZING ( I am in love. This, and the face wash - these are the best I have ever tried & I've spent more. LOVE have already purchased the full size. This is 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Perfect."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,A must have for dry skin,I bought the travel size for a short trip just to try it out and absolutely loved it. It’s deeply moisturizing and great for my dry skin. It leaves a natural and healthy glow. I highly recommend it for dry skin.
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Sensitive Skin favorite,My all time favorite moisturizer. It’s very nice for sensitive skin. The cream does not have a smell and helps my skin feel hydrated all day.
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,I love this cream/moisturizer,I highly recommend this product as the best cream and moisturizer that I have ever tried; it has an excellent packaging
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Worth it!,This has become my go to moisturizer and haven’t needed to add many additional steps to my skincare routine. Is super hydrating so better for dry skin or in fall/winter months.
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Tatcha The Dewy Skin Cream - 50ml,"I have always believed moisturizer didn’t matter the brand as long as you had one. I typically buy the vitamin a b and c inkey list moisturizer. I think it’s good and much cheaper but simple. I have not found another one I really want to spend money one but after trying this one I knew I had to buy it. I don’t have to do as much treatment because of this moisturizer. Idk what they put in it but I have less skin issues like acne, redness, and white heads. My skin is super gooey and healthy. I maybe young but I feel years of this moisturizer will keep me looking young. Worth the $$$"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Absolutely Amazing,"I have really sensitive skin... before this I could only use aveeno. After getting the mini size for my birthday gift, I fell in love. It not only smells light and beautiful, but it feels amazing on your skin. The best part is that you only have to use the tiniest amount which means it will last you for a long time, so it's great for the price! It makes my skin rejuvenate and evens out my skin tone. If you're thinking about getting this moisturizer... do it!!!!!"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Tatcha The Dewy Skin Cream - 50ml,"Received a small amount as part of my free birthday gift.  I use it as a daytime moisturizer and I love it.  It glides on smoothly, feels great on my skin, and I look more refreshed."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,"A nice addition to my daily routine, love it!!!","Love the texture, it feels luxurious and leaves my skin refreshed."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,Tatcha The Dewy Skin Cream - 50ml,Got this cream in my birthday kit. My face got red and I had a burning sensation. I guess I will have to look for a different moisturizer.
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,Amazing for all skin types,I usually prefer thick rich creams as I’m a combination/dry skin type but I was surprised (I received it as a sample) and the first night of use I woke up with my face looking so smooth and dewy and like refreshed and even
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,"Breakouts and sticky skin, ew...","I normally love Tatcha's products and was excited to get this in my birthday gift set this year but this cream is terrible. It leaves my skin feeling sticky and gross and within a couple days of using it, I had an acne problem. I'll go back to using the Water Cream which was amazing, went on silky smooth, and didn't cause breakouts."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Amazing moisturizer!,Amazing moisturizer!!! This moisturizer is my favorite by far. Been using it for two years and absolutely love it. So smooth and hydrating while leaving no tacky feeling behind. I always keep 2 or 3 on hand so I don’t run out!
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Buy this nowww!,I’ve always loved Tatcha products but this is the BEST product. I have dry skin and this makes me skin feel so moisturized and makeup layers great on it. My skin has never looked better after using this. I’ve already re
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Skin changer,"This stuff is amazing. My skin is hydrated and looks rested when I use it as instructed. I don’t need to wear foundation because this moisturizer brings color back into my skin. A little lipstick, blush and I’m ready for the day"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Great moisturizer,Feels amazing on your skin. Hydrating feels smooth for hours after application. Would highly recommend
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,Skin saver!,"Absolutely love this! I have very dry skin, and have found that it's only become more dry and sensitive as I've gotten older. One of my children has severe food allergies, so I try to avoid nut and seed products in my skincare as best as possible. Turns out that is NOT EASY when it comes to hydrating creams! Nothing I was trying was cutting it... until this! It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, is super hydrating, leaves a beautiful glow, and works well under makeup. The only con I can think of is the price, especially considering I find that I have to use more than the pea-sized amount recommended. But I'll suck it up and keep buying it. It's that good."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,6/10 stars,"I absolutely love this product!! After receiving the “sample” as my birthday gift, I just had to purchase the biggest size available. Extremely disappointed that this time my product was extremely watery and not as creamy as the sample was. From what I’ve read this product is supposed to always be creamy so I’m extremely disappointed"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Amazing,"I’ve been using this moisturizer for a few months and it is my holy grail! I have a lot of redness and dry patches from rosacea and not only did this not make it worse, it’s saved my skin! Can’t live w/o it!"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,Yuk,I really wanted to love this cream. But it was more like a heavy petroleum gel in consistency and hard to put on . Bad batch maybe ??
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Great for dry flakey Skin,I have super dry flakey skin and couldn't find anything that would work except for this product!! it's sooo worth it
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,New Formula?,"I purchased this moisturizer over a year ago and loved it SO much. Smelled good, felt luxurious, and really moisturized my skin. I decided to buy it again about two months ago because other, more affordable moisturizers weren’t getting the job done like this one did. The second time around, this product no longer worked for me. It doesn’t sink into the skin and pills on my face (which is my #1 skincare peeve). I can no longer put makeup on top of this moisturizer without my makeup looking like a hot mess and rolling off my face. Not sure if the formula changed, but I will not be repurchasing. I think Tatcha’s Water Cream is a much better option!"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,caused break out,"I have normally clear skin, used this two days now I have tiny pimples all over my face! this won't let me rate as a 1 star. but do not use if you have clear skin."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Thiccc,"It smells really good and applies well, but the cream is a little too thick for sensitive skin. I apply it at night and wake up feeling oily. I would recommend it for drier skin but for combination skin not so much."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,Beautiful Product and Packaging,"LOVE this product. So creamy and moisturizing, but not greasy. Nice light scent that doesn’t linger. I am very sensitive to fragrances and this one doesn’t bother me at all. I got the Tatcha bday gift set a few days ago. Used the face cream 2x and went and purchased the value size container."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Tatcha The Dewy Skin Cream - 50ml,"It definitely moisturizes but it feels a bit thick on the face.
And when I start putting make up on, it gets scrubbed off like dead skin."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Worth the splurge!,"I got the sample for my birthday and let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised on how nice this cream was. I have sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin AT ALL. It made it plump, dewy and well hydrated just like the product says. It goes amazing under makeup and as a night cream. It’s goes on beautifully and my skin looks brighter and healthier. It’s an amazing product and worth the hype and mind you I’m a skincare snob so not easily impressed by just anything. Treat yourself if you can!"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,So disappointed,"I’m 49, normal to dry skin, and this did absolutely nothing for my skin. I expected plump, hydrated skin (yea, I drink plenty of water) but didn’t get what I expected."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,"My skin loves it, my wallet doesn’t!","I hate how much I love this moisturizer! I have acne-prone skin and have always struggled with hormonal breakouts. I also have dry skin, especially in the winter. I’ve tried countless moisturizers from drugstore to medical grade. And this is the best one I’ve found for my skin. It feels so luxurious I haven’t tried anything that’s like this at all. The texture is so unique: it’s rich enough to moisturize my dry skin, yet it absorbs so easily (which I LOVE because I hate moisturizers that just sit on top of the skin). It’s also super gentle so if my skin is irritated this soothes it. I use this every night and I can’t see myself ever going without it."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,BEST EVER!!!,"This is by far my favourite moisturizer. This adds so much moisture to my skin and makes my skin glow. A little bit of product goes a long way, so the tub will last a while! Definitely worth the price if you’re willing to splurge on a moisturizer!"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,Love this cream !,This is one of the nicest creams I have used in a while.  I would definitely purchase.
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Magic in a bottle,I love this product so much this is the best purchase I ever made my skin is better then before again I got the travel size and I fall in love with it before you get the large size get the small one see if it works for your skin even though the ingredients are good for all skin types I recommend just to get the bigger size because if it doesn’t work for you you can always return it but I don’t think people who purchase this people return it because it works magical on their skin so definitely if you gave up on skin products or your skin is damaged and acne I highly recommend this is worth the money.
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Bad Just Bad…,"I received this product from the birthday gift set. I chose the product because of all the hype and good reviews. I have combination skin (super oily nose and normal skin everywhere else) and this product resulted in me having EXTREMELY dry and flaky skin. I didn’t add any other new product to my routine except this but about two days after using this, I started to see some flakiness and eventually dryness. This really confuses me because everyone else said that it’s either too oily or perfect so I might’ve gotten a bad batch or something. Overall I had a terrible experience with this product."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Look no further!!,"This is the only product I have ever received a sample of, then went back to get the full size! I cannot say enough great things about this moisturizer/game changer. The way it glides on my skin, the subtlety clean scent, the natural glow and overall even tone it gives me are equally amazing. The number of people who have asked me what makeup I’m wearing is crazy! They are all shocked when I tell them I’m only wearing moisturizer. I’m considering trying the whole line of the facial care system but it’s pretty pricey. I’m curious ,if my skin looks this good with just the moisturizer, what could it be if I incorporate the whole line on my skincare routine??"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Love this moisturizer,"Amazing moisturizer, I got a free set for my birthday. Loved it. I used it on summer, so not sure how it will be on winter. Love the texture and how it melts on my skin. Love, love and love"
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Oily and pills,I have dry skin and it made my skin feel very oily and greasy. Not moisturizing at all. My skin doesn't absorb it and it sits on the top and pills. A disaster if you try to apply makeup after using it. My makeup had never looked so bad. Save your money.
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,worth the money for dry skin!,"i have used this product for about 9 months now, and i have to say it is definitely worth the money. i finished the sample size container in about 1-2 months, and am halfway done the regular sized container, which is being used once or twice a day for 7-8 months. it’s still not empty yet and gives me super hydrated skin."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Tatcha The Dewy Skin Cream - 50ml,"I’m writing this review now because I have moved on from this product. Trying to learn what feels good, what works and what’s good for your skin, is tricky. It’s a learning journey but I’ve used this for a couple years now. At first my skin was on the dryer end and this help moisturize it, a lot. It’s thick and really heavy and oily. I don’t like that but after the years it’s transformed my skin to now, not oily, but hydrated, even when I’m not wearing it. Like I said, I can move on now, it’s done it’s job but it’s just too heavy to continue to use now."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Malaysia,Holy Grail,This is such a wonderful face cream that deeply nourishes your skin before makeup. It also works well as a night cream as it truly helps lock in your serums.
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Tatcha The Dewy Skin Cream - 50ml,"I wanted to love this, but as soon as it touched my skin burning sensation and redness. I only gave it a week because my skin was breaking out, it has been 2 weeks that I have stopped using it and when back to glow skin care and my skin has no more pimples. I’m sure it’s a good product just not for my skin."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Smells amazing,Smells amazing and leave my skin feeling soft and hydrated.
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,AMAZING!!!,OMG it think I found what I was looking for. This cream is AMAZING. I got it as a gift from the store for my birthday. This is the best moisturizer ever
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Such A Let Down,"I got a sample of this for my free birthday gift. I had heard great things about Tatcha and had been wanting to try it for a while so i was extremely excited and hoping to love it. 

Right off the bat this has a fragrance. I’m not particularly sensitive to fragrances but it is worth noting. It is also EXTREMELY oily and greasy. It felt disgusting to have on my face. I was hoping this would go away as I worked the product in however that did not happen. The cream remains oily and never really works into the skin how a cream should. It sort of just sits on top. It’s literally as if I applied an oil on my skin. 

Overall this was not a good experience. I’m unsure if maybe I got some sort of defected cream. I see so many great reviews and was hoping to have a similar experience. I really did want to like this product and was even hoping on purchasing the full size but I’ve changed my mind. 

Don’t purchase this without having tried it first."
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,Canada,Tatcha The Dewy Skin Cream - 50ml,after many mini versions i have finally bought the full size. i actually got the 75ml today & this has been my favourite moisturizer for awhile now. i highly suggest it. it’s worth every penny.
TATCHA-The Dewy Skin Cream,USA,Caused Terrible Breakout,"At first I loved this moisturizer. it is super hydrating, great for night time use but it's not oils so it works for daytime use too, especially if you live in a dry climate like myself. But after about a week of using it along with the Tatcha Rice Wash, I broke out with terrible acne all over my chin and forehead - I normally have very clear skin and, aside from a random pimple or two every once in a while, I never break out like this. I will never use anything from Tatcha again after the experience I had with this product."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,Singapore,2nd jar. excellent! ,Its very good to my dry skin. Takes hours to absorb so put on 2 hours before going to bed or you be rubbing it all over your pillow. Makes my skin soft the next day. 
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,Australia,amazing product ,Absolutely loving this night cream. It’s so light on the skin. My skin doesn’t feel greasy when I wake up. Highly recommend this product and will definitely buy more in the future.

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,Singapore,Love the texture and made my skin heals,I was having very bad acne and with the night cream it calms my redness and inflammation. face feels less tighten and wake up with soothing face. would recommend to anyone who has acne or sensitive skin.
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,USA,solid night cream,"this is a nice, solid night cream. it's softly scented and creamy but not super thick. i like my night creams a bit thicker than this, though i find it fairly moisturizing. it does feel very nice on the skin, does not make it greasy or feel heavy at all."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,Singapore,thick ,too thick and rich for my skin. does not work well on me. did not repurchase this product. fresh products doesn't seem to work well on my skin but luckily no outbreak 
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,Singapore,lovely product ,feels nice and light yet moisturising. I love the smell too. Helps my skin feel moisturised the entire night and doesn’t feel tacky. Love it!!!!!!!!!!!

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,USA,A Nice Cream,I tried the mini size of this very nice cream. I like this cream and it has a pleasant blue-lotus scent that I recognize from a blue-lotus hair conditioner that I tried once. I think this is a pleasant cream and I would buy this one again.
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,Singapore,fresh lotus youth preserve dream face cream,this product does not leave a sticky residue and does not break me out. it absorbs quickly and the texture of the cream is amazing :) will definitely recommend

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,Canada,Dreamy night cream,"Absolutely love this night cream. Creamy thick texture that glides on skin and melts in overnight. I haven’t seen any notable improvement in lines/wrinkles but I’ve got other potions for that. As a high impact night cream for older dry skin, it’s perfect. And the scent?? Like cool cucumbers. Love, love this cream. Such a treat."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,Canada,Did they change the formula?! :(,I have been using this night cream for YEARS! Mainly because it hydrates my skin so well that when I wake up in the morning my skin looks plump and fresh. That being said… did they change the formula? My new container of this cream doesn’t feel as thick and hydrating as the previous creams. And when I wake up my skin doesn’t look as reFRESHed as it use to. Slightly disappointed as I may need to find a new night cream after many years of use :(
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,Malaysia,Ms,"It's really good and hydrating but it does not go well under makeup, it makes my makeup look cakey. I would recommend to buy this only if you want to use it for your night skin care only. Other than that, I love how it makes my skin feel,"

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,Malaysia,Okay product,Works well with my skin but does not see any special effect it does. Just a normal product nothing to wow about. Decent but would not repurchase. Still prefer my drunk elephant. Scent is abit too overpowering for my liking as well.

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,Singapore,good and creamy! ,This product is good for night time use cos it’s a little on the heavier side. It’s very creamy and moisturizing. Not suitable for people with oily skin though! Very good for dry skin 
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,USA,Nothing special,"Face was soft and moisturized but no noticeable anti-aging effects. Didn't seem to diminish fine lines or help much with discoloration. Smells nice, not overpowering. Lasted a while."

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,Singapore,My favourite,Rich but not greasy! Still my go-to night moisturizer. I don’t have to layer much underneath and it still gives me the perfect glow in the morning! Even on days where I barely get enough rest! 
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,USA,it is exactly a moisturizer,"It’s okay!  Makes my skin feel nice and even a small amount leaves me feeling soft and moisturized in the morning.  The reason it gets three stars is the fragrance.  For being a “clean” product it is very strong.  I probably won’t purchase it again.  But if you don’t mind a sweet floral scent, I recommend it."

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,USA,FRESH Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream - 15ml,"I reallllllly wanted to like this product. I like the smell, I like the texture, I even felt like my skin was glowier after using it. However, I can’t continue to use it bc it made my skin break out with a few little pimples every day in spots that I never get acne. My skin is on the dryer side, so it surprised me to break out. I’m sure it’s a great product for some, but not for me."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,Australia,loved it,"I loved the smell and its light-weighted, and hydrating. I applied it daily and My skin felt lot better. I Will definitely recommend as a night cream.

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,USA,Sticky,"I love other Fresh products I have and buy carefully cuz they’re pricey.  What I usually love are the hedonic (texture, scent, feel etc) but this formula goes on tacky and makes my skin feel sticky.  I use it at night on neck only because the feel on my face is kind of gross. Shame."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,Malaysia,Love it so much !!!!,"Apply it every night and wake up the next morning feeling brighter.  And the next day, the face will not become very oily, it will be a little foggy, and the point is that it is very fragrant!  I love it so much!"

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,USA,It does what it says!,"I used the whole container and I will say that it is very hydrating! I normally use the black tea firming one but I wanted to try out more of Fresh's line, so I got the youth preserve. I would say it definitely serves its stated purpose, but I would also say (for me) I like the black tea better"
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,USA,just meh,"3 stars only.. it was meh.. didn’t do much for my skin. I have combination skin type (dry on the chin and cheeks, oily T-zone), I had to put an extra layer of a different moisturizer after I apply this one."

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,USA,FRESH Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream - 15ml,"I got this as a rewards trial size and loved it so much, I’m now the owner of a full size. It’s extremely light weight yet hydrating. I took it on vacation where I got pretty sunburnt on my face and it literally saved my skin barrier. I use it every night now and even sometimes during the day if I’m feeling like I need more moisture. I don’t break out and I have sensitive skin. The scent is really nice too!"
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,Canada,Smaller size barely half full of product,This review is specifically for the smaller size.

Will be returning for the full size.
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,Canada,Good moisturizer,"This is a very good cream, especially for my combination skin. It is not very greasy and does not leave a film on the face, it can be used in the morning under makeup. I did this during the cold period. And in combination with the serum at night, this cream makes my skin more taut and moisturized."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,Malaysia,Great but not enough to moisture my skin. ,"Love the smell. Smell like peach. The texture not too thick and absorb well into my skin. Wakeup to soft skin and pore feel smaller however not enough to moisturize my skin. Didn't cause my skin to breakup. 

My skin type is very dry but sometimes oily at t-zone.

I decided to try something new. After researching creams I found Lotus and it had great reviews. I was a little Leary in the reviews that said they noticed a change after 1 use. Well…I’m now one of those people! After one use I had no little white head zits and my skin looked fresh and bright!!! After one week my skin looked more healthy and more vibrant than it has in the last 10 years!!!"

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,USA,Floral Scent Lingers on Skin,"I hated the smell of this product. The fragrance is so strong and lingers for a long while after use. I usually can get over smells, but I couldn’t for this product. The packaging is nice, the texture of the cream is good, and it does sink into the skin nicely. I don’t think that it is worth the price and I probably wouldn’t buy it again even if it was fragrance free. My skin didn’t look or feel any better using it. I also like my “night” moisturizers to be a little thicker."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream,USA,difference in less than a week,"I’ve been using this for less than a week and I see a huge difference already. My skin tone is even and haven’t had a breakout, all while PMSing. I use it along with Kiehl’s ultra facial cream with sunscreen. I’m dry/combo and it’s the best duo I’ve found for my skin."

FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Australia,ok,"I don’t think it’s that great. I was expecting better. It smells nice but I thought it would be more rich and last longer on the skin. There are better moisturisers out there. I also tried to use it under makeup. It didn’t really sit that well under makeup. 
"

FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,USA,Great moisturizer. Silly packaging,Smells lovely and moisturizers well. I can see a slight improvement in my skin so far. The packaging is silly though and uses unnecessary components and plastic so you don't end up getting much product at this price point.
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,USA,SO DISAPPOINTED MAN,"GOT THIS TODAY WITH SAME DAY DELIVERY. WAS SO EXCITED TO TRY! IT'S SUCH A WEIRD CONSISTENCY-- ALMOST LIKE LIQUID CLAY? IDK. I WAS REALLY EXPECTING SOMETHING MELTY AND HYDRATING THAT WOULD SINK INTO THE SKIN. SOME PPL THAT DESCRIBED THEIR SKIN AS DRY SAID THIS WAS GREAT. I ALSO HAVE DRY SKIN, BUT AM NOT A PERSON WHO BREAKS OUT. I DO NOT HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN AT ALL, BUT I HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF SMELL AND THIS IS JUST OFF... SOMEONE ELSE SAID IT SMELLS LIKE MAKE UP AND I GUESS THAT IS AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION EVEN THOUGH IT SOUNDS AMBIGUOUS. I'M RETURNING THIS ASAP."
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Australia,My no1,"I am absolutely obsessed with this moisturiser.

FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Philippines,love it,"I was curious to try Fenty Skin for myself, particularly to see how it would fare on my dry and often sensitive skin. When it comes to moisturiser, I love Facetheory’s grapefruit-scented Amil-C Whip M5 SPF 30 – my skin laps it up like it’s never been moisturised before. Would my skin like Fenty's offering just as much? Like a lot of people, my skin isn't consistently sensitive but it flares up depending on the time of the month, the amount of stress I experience and the weather, too. "
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Canada,Fenty Skin Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,It’s really good.. but a little pricey for what you really get. I’ll only buy when I want to splurge.
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Malaysia,Expensive ,This is my second or third purchase. I’m trying to create a consistent skincare routine and this night cream has become a staple. The price is a bit steep for me but I use it on alternating nights for it to last longer 🙈

I’ve only been using this for about 2 weeks but I haven’t experienced any break outs. I’ve got sensitive skin as well and hasn’t caused any problems
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Canada,Fenty Skin Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,The review is only based on packaging and the amount not 50mL. Very disappointed. I will be calling the store. I am not a fan of the packaging seems cheap and flimsy. Maybe I am not putting it right but it always comes apart.
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,USA,Fave nighttime cream,"I really do enjoy this night cream. I have been using it for about three or four months and am just now running out (ordering one rn) I have used nightcream from youth of the people, versed, tatcha. This has been my fave.

FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Australia,Luxurious at an affordable price,I have always been interested in trying this product. I use it as a serum-in-cream because of its ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and niacinamide and a little goes a long way with the spatula included. I like the luxe design and its eco-refillable container. The scent makes me feel like tropical paradise awaits me with every use. It is luxury at a relatively affordable compared to other luxury creams on the market.
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,New Zealand,"Nice cream, good for daily use ","I've almost used my first full tub of this product and it has been a great addition to my skincare routine. The moisturiser is lovely, but I would expect it to be thicker for an overnight cream/gel. It has nice hydration, lovely packaging (with an application spatula included), and overall I've enjoyed using this overnight cream and would recommend it. I think there are better products at a similar price point, however I can't fault this product and would repurchase in future. I have combination/sensitive skin and this has caused no irritation for me. "

I wanted to give the night one a chance. and I'm glad I did. It feels good on my skin and isn't sticky. I do like the refill concept but it feels a bit green washy - could still buy the refill without having the box/case for it. it's a good start"
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Australia,Good product,"easy to use daily, does need to sit a few mins before hitting the pillow but generally it's not sticky, definitely noticed on holiday when I wasn't using this product that my skin wasn't as glowy and hydrated as usual. Love the packaging, the container doesn't last as long as I had hoped though compared to similar products, possibly I am using it more though."

I have combination skin, and some parts are more dry than others. When I use this at night it just doesn't give me the deep hydration that I want.

FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Australia,Nor for me ,On the hunt for the perfect night cream and this isn’t the one. Has a sticky residue after application and I don’t feel moisturised after. Agree with the over packaged comments and the product not being able to be recycled. Wanted to love it for the brand but wasn’t for me. Won’t repurchase. 
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Malaysia,My first Fenty Skin product,"Packaging is superb, environment-cautious, recyclable. Its perfect. Used it at night before bed, woke up with a refreshed skin with smoothness for the sides. I can trust the ingredients listed in the product, as I have an oily face. It does have fragrance (pleasantly sweet and fresh), but, I am among the others that doesn't bother at all since its a faint smell. I'll definitely buy again, in a form of a refill."
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Australia,Magic Cream ,SIS!! If you have dark spots this is your go to!! Any discoloration or scaring this is amazing!! super hydrating and doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky or greasy!!

FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,USA,breakouts & fragrance,"I’ve used this on and off for a year or so but was getting some pretty gnarly acne but I hadn’t narrowed it down to this product or other fenty skin products. I started using Tula to balance my skin out, went to add this cream back into my nightly routine because I like the smell and consistency, and woke up the next day with more breakouts. I’m bummed because it smells so nice, I love the packaging, but I just can’t use it. I’ve also stopped using the rest of the fenty skin line and have seen my skin clear up. If you have any kind of sensitive skin I don’t think this will work for you due to the scent."
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Singapore,It stinks,"I'm so disappointed! I bought this because it's supposedly ""clean"" and environmentally friendly. Also bc I love the Fenty make up line. But this is crap. It stinks to high heaven like fake tan. I had to double check it's not expired and doesn't have self tanner in it. And the whole packaging seems like a marketing ploy. it's not even recyclable. Won't repurchase. "

It does help to get rid some of my dark spots but it takes awhile to see the effect. The gel cream doesn’t leave a greasy sticky feeling after apply. All and all it’s a great night cream !! Will repurchase it ! 
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Australia,ririii has done it again ,"Okay, I bought this for aesthetic reasons haha and it’s riri. But not to be bias. It is actually a very nice overnight cream. I have 2 in my collection, But this is my favourite so far. Leaves your skin feeling so smooth. You’ll have a beautiful glow in morning. It might feel a little heavy for those who might be very oily. I have dry skin, so this really kept my skin from flaking. And it has scent to it not to strong. Smells so good."
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Australia,the best,"My every night routine!!! The best moisturiser for night time. Not sticky and feels good on the skin. I love that you don’t use your fingers to pick up the product as well.
This is my third refill :)"
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Australia,"really nourishing, absorbs well into the skin",I feel like the texture of my skin the next morning is smoother after using this overnight cream. A little goes a long way and the cream disappears into my skin with light massaging. Will be getting a refill. 
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Australia,Not really a recovery cream for someone who had acne before,"It sure gives you the glow, the moisture your skin needs but after just a few days of using it, my skin became super oily. I've stopped using it for almost a month now and my skin still gets super oily every few hour, which has never happened before. And it gives me pimple on the sides of my nose, sides of my chin and middle of the forehead - all the oily zones. "
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Australia,pretty good moisturiser ,"This is a nice moisturiser, hydrating and smooth consistency. Nothing spectacular but still nice would recommend getting this on sale if interested. Love that’s it’s a refillable container "
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Canada,Fenty Skin Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,"makes my skin feel refreshed and moisturized. I've used a lot of other, more expensive, overnight creams and this is just as good (and in some cases, better)."
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,USA,thanks rih!,"I really love this fenty skin line. I have the cleanser, fat water, moisturizer and overnight Cream. The over night cream hydrates and it also toned my skin, I had white blotches on my skin and after a week my skin is noticeably better and clearer. All of the products have a very nice scent. Thanks rih!"
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Australia,love this,"Love the packaging, the little scoop is such a good idea rather then using fingers. Feels so nice on my skin and leaves me feeling hydrated when I wake up "
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,USA,Sorry it didn't work,"I don't think this is environmentally friendly. I cannot recycle the inside part, and the outside case uses a lot of plastics. The lid doesn't close all the way, so it's slightly open. I don't think i will buy a refill. The cream is nice and moisturizing but it smells like silicone and the fragrance is trying to hide that smell. I like daytime SPF cream, but not this one."
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,Australia,nourishing!!!,"Beautiful nourishing night moisturiser!! Gorgeous going on & lovely scent. My skin feels so hydrated in the morning, even after the very first use! LOVE IT! "
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,USA,Wish my skin liked it like I did,"My chin and nose area was starting to feel dry and the spf moisturizer just wasn't cutting it so I purchased this. Felt great putting it on and was helping with my dryness but I woke up with patchy red marks on my cheeks and they itched, tried again for the 2nd night thinking maybe it was because of something that got on my face during the night. Again woke up with itchy patchy red marks on my cheeks. Not sure if it is just too heavy for my skin as I use the cleanser/toner/spf moisturizer with no issues."
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,USA,Winner,"I just started using it and it's a great overnight cream.  Feels good on the skin and my skin looks fabulous the next day. It looks more radiant, and I do believe it's brighter the reason I got this was due to how dull my skin was looking and I'm very happy with this purchase.  Will buy again when I run out."
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream,USA,BEST PRODUCT EVER!!,"When I tell you this is the best item you can buy! I was spectacle at first due to the variety of reviews but it has been my best investment. I have acne prone skin and would have a very hard time finding something that would clear my skin UNTIL I FOUND THIS PRODUCT. My acne is completely gone. No more Curology, or dermatologist visits or medications!! Now all I have are the acne scars. Im in love and would definitely recommend!"

"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,4 star,"Gifted to a friend for his birthday. Works accordingly, blocks out the oily atmosphere after-usage. Friend wish that the scent is a tiny bit more pleasant "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,Great Moisturizer!,"Does the job! Nothing to fault with it, love the ingredients and feels great on my skin. Dries down quickly, so I don't have to wait to long to put my sunscreen on. Will buy again"
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",New Zealand,great,i liked this moisturiser the most. it has got the goodness of vitamin B C and E. bought it for myself but my husband is using it. definately reccommend it
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,Nice,Super cheap and effective I love it
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,mositure,"really good hydration product. Moisturizer creates a barrier between your skin and the climate, including cold, dry air that can further dry out skin. Moisturizing also helps to rehydrate and enhance the capacity of the skin to hold water."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,my daily moisturiser ,I’ve been using this for a few months and the improvement in my skin is phenomenal. I suffer from dry skin and this is given me the glow I have always wanted. Love this moisturiser so much 
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",New Zealand,Mrs,"Really like this moisturiser, great price . Good for someone who loves the glowy skin. I used both AM and PM. Highly recommended. Love inkey products. "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,alright,Good product but nothing that special about it but definitely good.
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,Good for Beginner’s,"Good moisturiser for a beginner in skincare or for a teenage girl, however as someone who seeks more hydration this did not provide a good deal of hydration as it is on the thinner more gel texture side of moisturisers. This product would be good for summer as it is lightweight and another plus is the price which is great."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,ohemggiees,"Clean-excellently! I will definitely repurchase, like always via Sephora the cheapest compare to other platform... It is very important to use skincare so that our face will forever beautiful"
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,loved it,"I have acne prone skin and this moisturiser saved my skin. Makes your skin grow, looks healthy and very hydrated. I always recommend this product to all my friends
"
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,ok moisturiser,"It is an ok moisturiser. I have dry and sensitive (rosacea prone) skin. So Far I have used in the winter and for my skin it is not moisturising enough, however, it will suit better in the summer. Perhaps better for normal to combo skin. "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,really like this,"this is a really good lightweight moisturiser ! i use it in the mornings, and it’s really good on my dry skin. it feels really good to apply. i’m not sure how much it’s made my skin brighter or whatever, but still for the price it’s good! and the size makes it good to travel with. "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,not for me,It feel so stick my and uncomfortable to begin with and I dont like the greasy feeling every time i use this….. idk if it is actually an effective moisturiser 🥲
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,Ms,"First impressions won’t overwhelm with the signature black-and-white packaging, but the brand says this allows for more budget to be pumped into the formulas. I don’t see any changes anymore on my skin and I will not get my second buy."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,"Okay, not my favourite ","I liked this product initially and it’s low price point is a bonus. A very moisturising product with no scent from memory however, I didn’t stay in love with it. I may return back to it one day, just not a favourite. Good for sensitive skin though. 
"
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,it’s alright,i got this cause it’s cheap and friendly with simple and good ingredients. i actually like it butttt it’s not exactly moisturizing. i have combo skin. currently using the omega water and i prefer that. i’ll get this if the omega waters out of stock.
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,great vit c cream,most vit c creams irritate my skin however this one does not. it is lightweight and also works well under makeup. for the price it is a great product.
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,Ok-Ok,This is an okok moisturiser to me. Reason being its hard to be absorb and its watery type. It’s pretty similar to drugstore brand moisturiser. I still finish it and at least it didn’t cause me any skin problem at all. But it does very averagely to me. It can be used as a cheaper options for day cream for me.
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,Vitamin moisturiser,"A light moisturiser that’s nots too sticky and can be placed under makeup for extra hydration. After a while of using, skin does look plump, moisturised and dewy. "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,Simple & effective!,"This is a great all-rounder moisturiser that anyone can use! I bought this as a gift for my partner who loves it and uses it twice daily —
morning and evening. Vitamin C is great for brightening and evening the skin, and vitamin E repairs and rejuvenates skin damaged from the sun and free radicals. "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,Moisturiser ,"This last for 6 months as my night moisturiser. Works well for my skin ,experienced brightening and smoothing effect. Did not repurchase as it is rarely available in Sephora Malaysia . So I switched to a different moisturiser. 

My Skin Type : Combination

"
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Singapore,Lightweight and affordable,"This moisturiser is really light weight, its non-sticky and perfect for everyday use. I also like how its fragrance free! "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,good moisturiser ,"It’s a fine product, feels lightweight on the skin and is moisturising enough although have not used enough to determine whether I would repurchase. Also a great price for the size and I assume a good way to get these vitamins into your skincare "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",New Zealand,Miss,"Super good value for money and really smooth texture, great everyday moisturiser "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Singapore,holy grail ,"Disappears my moisture barrier, so well and it’s so nice and thick moisturizer. But it doesn’t feel so sick that it feels uncomfortable when you’re out in the warmth. It’s very very hydrating and I recommend it to everyone is looking for a simple moisturizer moisturizer"
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",USA,Made me oily.,"I have cystic hormonal acne and pretty oily skin, but it’s relatively rare a moisturizer makes me feel this oily. I’ve been using this before bed for the past few days and every time I wake up, my face is caked in oil. I exfoliate beforehand too, so all that oiliness pops up overnight somehow. I have very sensitive eyes too, and this did irritate my eyes a bit when I accidentally put some product too close once.
 
My skin does look nice, but I feel like The Ordinary natural moisturizing factors + HA or just good old CeraVe cream makes my skin *feel* better than this does though. Would probably work better for someone who’s skin can handle about oils/pore-clogging products in small amounts. Gonna continue to use to see if my skin will adjust at all, since it hasn’t made me break out."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,Excellent choice ,This is an excellent choice to feed your skin with when you need different kind of goodness. Always know what your skin needs first to find the right ones
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",New Zealand,Good,"It is nice, gives a smooth texture, its okay, normal, nothing special."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",USA,"The Inkey List Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer - 50ml(Original)",Great product for dry skin. I used it twice a day and felt my skin got better after 2 weeks.
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,inkey list,"i bought this moisturiser because of tiktok but i do not really like it. its irritates my eyes quite a lot. and it hasnt done much for my skin as i have sensitive skin. do not buy if you have sensitive skin
"
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,Combination skin user,"I think i like heavier moisturisers, this is unscented, light like serums & dries quick. Its doesnt seem to be a completely full bottle. Probably wont buy again but happy i tried it."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",USA,"The Inkey List Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer - 50ml(Original)",good amount of product for the price & i do like it! just leaves my face feeling kinda tight
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Singapore,affordable moisturizer,"Does not do magic, but does its job as a moisturiser, skins feels softer and less textured after application. However, doesn't work very well for dry skin, the texture is pretty light weight."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,decent ,"I have very sensitive skin, and the inkey list products usually don’t work and are very harsh on my skein, but this moisturiser was pretty gentle. I just found it didn’t work with my skin"
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,Absorbs quick! ,"I have oily skin, so I was quite surprised when I used this and my skin slurped it all up without leaving a tacty feeling or a glistening shine. My skin doesn't feel or look oily throughout the day either."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",USA,Very good,"Great for the price, my perfect night moisturizer. Can be good during the cold, dry months too but makes me a lil oily, consider myself to be combo/oily."

"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",New Zealand,Cheap and cheerful,"Great daily moisturiser. I use this when I cant afford my Tarte moisturiser, its got a lovely texture, absorbes really nicely and doesn't leave Stickiness."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,Inkey List moisturiser ,Love this product. Slides on and sinks into skin quite well :)
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,moisturiser ,"It’s ok moisturiser Not bad for price but doesn’t 
make any difference to my skin. I got it because this brand has a lot of hype but not but again. Thanks 😊 "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",USA,great lightweight moisturizer,I have oily skin and use this every morning in my skincare routine. it's lightweight but still is moisturizing. I've had no issues with irritation or breakouts while using this. I don't notice my skin looking any brighter while using this but it definitely looks hydrated
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",New Zealand,Everyday ,Good everyday moisturizer. Not quite enough moisture for my combo skin so I add a few drops of jojoba oil or squalane oil for extra glow. The tube could be improved. It's short and wide so it's hard to get the last bit out.
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,all in one moisturizer,an  affordable  moisturizer  that  offers  beneficial  aplenty  for  the  skin. This  moisturizer is  perfect  for  morning  and  night  routine.  Solid 4.5/5
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,hydrating ,"I do love this moisturiser it’s so nice on my dry skin, it doesn’t leave a dry feeling like some moisturisers do and looks nice under my makeup and doesn’t effect my eczema."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,Good moisturiser for all skin type. ,Im a MUA and i used this on my clients and its adapting with all skin types so far. Would like to repurchase again. I hope Sephora can stock up in bulky amount. This products always OOS. SO SADDD

I've gone through bottles of it.. even though now it has a slight price increase its still super duper affordable and does the job. the product i must have in my routine to maintain my skin's health. 
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",New Zealand,Not heavy ,"Applies well to my skin and is light in consistency.  Great for the day under make up. Doesn’t make my oily skin feel oily.  For the price, a definite buy again me. "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,face moisturiser ,"One of the best face moisturiser that I’ve used and own I can never get tired of it, it’s not heavy at all and it’s so light when it’s applied onto the skin leaving it fully moisturised "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Singapore,Solid Favourite,I have repurchased countless times. Wished it came in a bigger size tbh (and maybe in a different packaging—it's hard to get the cream out in good doses)
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,not that moisturising ,"it’s okay, I have oily skin but it’s not that moisturising but fairly cheap so it’s alright 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍"
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",USA,Please Change Your Container!,"Horrible container. Before you open it, lightly tap it on the counter so the product isn't sitting in the top portion ready to blow like a volcano. After opening, lightly squeeze until product comes out (and in my case, ends up on the floor). I went ahead decanted mine. I keep a few beautiful jars from luxe brands just for that. The product is thin and runny so if you're looking for a lightweight moisturizer you found it. It's okay, I can't tell a difference from any other drugstore brand. It isn't right for me so I'll be trying something else."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,my all time fave moisturiser,"This is my all time fave go-to moisturiser, nothing but nutrients going onto my face. Nil fragrances, just a clean simple product which I swear by. It is also a very good price. "

"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Singapore,Good moisturiser! ,"It is a good and affordable moisturiser, it keeps the moisture of my face, with no smell at all which I like! Definitely will re-purchase in the future. "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",USA,Very runny,"I don’t like how runny this moisturizer is. It’s very easy to poor too much by accident and for it to be wasted if you turn it upside down. Other than that, it is lightweight. It mixes well with other skincare products and brands."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,Nellie,"Really good everyday moisturiser and works well under foundation. I use Estee Lauder Double Wear, which can be dry but this moisturizer is a good base. Leaves skin plump. No irritation for sensitive skin."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,I don’t like it.,I started getting breakouts all over my face after using it once. Thought maybe it wasnt suitable for me so I decided to give it to my partner but they got the same bad effects too. So I just threw it away. I don’t think this is worth it.
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",New Zealand,good moisturiser ,"This is my first product purchase from the inkey list and I find this moisturiser as a Budget friendly moisturiser that suits dry skin with vitamin B, C and E"
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Singapore,it’s ok,Used up a tube and I don’t know if I’ll repurchase. It’s a good moisturizer for the price that there isn’t much else that I could say. The moisturizer is thick and a pea size is good enough.
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Singapore,Moisturizer ,Used this a few times and already seeing results. My skin is evened out and plumped. I love it. Can were it under makeup too. 
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,Affordable for daytime moisturiser,You don’t need to pay hundreds dollars on moisturiser. This one did a good job at keeping my skin moisture throughout the day without making it too greasy.
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",New Zealand,Value for money ,"Love this product and the line in general for being simple and affordable. I bought this for travel, kind of wish they had larger sizes though. It’s hard to come by a moisturiser with these ingredients too. "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",USA,"The Inkey List Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer - 50ml(Original)",Going to be great for the winter usually get dry around that time love the size and how it fits perfectly in my bag it seem lightweight and working good with my skin so far
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Singapore,so lightweight,I’m so impressed that this moisturiser is so lightweight yet adds a significant amount of moisture to my skin. It’s not heavy or sticky and pairs well with the wonder glow primer I purchased 
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,was kinda disappointed ,"I legit couldn’t use this, felt so thick and gross. I went to try this cause I love a lot of the products this brand has to offer. This I the only product of theirs I haven’t liked but still a miss"
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Philippines,Best moisturizer for night,I got this almost a month ago and I have been using it as my night time moisturizer to lock in my Dear Klairs toner and Inkey retinol cream. This works perfectly!
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,best,"A great moisturizer for people who have dry skin. But you have to use a good humectant for it to function I guess. If not, the moisturizer wont absorb as much from my experience."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,wouldn’t recommend ,"As someone with dry skin, I didn’t find this moisturiser helpful at all. Although it felt nice to apply, it didn’t make my skin feel moisturised. Won’t be purchasing again."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Singapore,Not for me,felt like the moisturizer never fully absorbed but my skin is very picky about moisturizer.
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,An OKAY,"Cheapest ever, served its purpose. But if you’re not tackling ageing skins, then this is not for you. Bought this but it doesn’t suits me- my skin type is dehydration with oily t zone, just a wrong type of products but doesn’t mean it’s a bad one."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,good ,"Wow. Just wow. I’ve had Natasha Denona products before and have mostly been pleased. But this blew me away. Likely my most favourite from her so far. It is the most beautiful glow, it made my skin look like that of a poreless goddess. I’m quite pale but with yellow undertones. I got the light medium just because it looked prettiest from the swatches even though I would usually go for the lightest in these kinds of things, I’m very pleased I did."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Singapore,niceee,"I have purchased the whole range of their there. This one is really good. I love it, makes my face I highly recommend all products of inkey list, I love all their products!!!!"
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,Nice moisturiser ,"Inkey list is a great brand with great ethics, formulas and well-priced products, this product is excellent in providing moderate moisturisation however I feel it is slightly drying at times, additionally, I wish the packing was larger as it runs out quickly and the tube generally spits out more product than what you need but for a cheap option for more combination skin, this is definitely nice.  "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,perfect for sensitive skin,If you want a basic moisturiser that does what it supposed to do this is it! It hydrates your skin leaving it nice and smooth and does not irritate the skin. I use it on days where my skin is feeling too congested and needs something soothing to calm it down. 
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",USA,"The Inkey List Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer - 50ml(Original)",I use this every day and the more in the morning after I wash my face apply my toner I take this and the antioxidant and I mix it together I put it on my face I am breaking out a bit but my skin is still getting used to it but my skin feels better than it has and I don't know how long my only thing is make sure you don't overdo it or it will look really greasy not glowing
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Singapore,nice!,really inexpensive moisturizer with good ingredients! bought it when the original price was only S$8 but i see now they’ve up it to S$11. slightly tacky for my oily skin but i only use it at night or for my neck.
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,A good daily moisturizer! ,This product is definitely very moisturizing. Applies easily and feels so good on the skin. The price is also affordable and has good ingredients in it too. 
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Malaysia,Quite sticky ,"I use this after using my essence. Even though it gives good hydration, but it quite sticky to my skin. Anyway, my skin slowly looks hydrated and it does it's job. Might consider to repurchase after finishing this one. "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",USA,The best for dehydrated Combo skin!!!,"Although I have combination skin type. As I have gotten older my skin is starting to lean towards combo-dry, so I needed something’s that’s nourishing but not oily. Was initially surprised at how thick the texture felt on my face but then woke up with supple skin in the morning and was also pleasantly surprised how good & supple my skin felt! Also tried it during the day and noticed how my skin was less oily than usual compared to other moisturizer. This is the best for my current skin. Love it! 
If you apply too much then just spread it down to your neck and hands."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,not my favourite Inkey List moisturiser ,"Texture is a bit more dense which I don’t mind, does it’s job fine but I can’t get over the scent - it’s quite unpleasant so at the moment I’m using in as a neck moisturiser (as far away from my nose as possible lol), took me by surprise because I use the Bakuchiol moisturiser and that one doesn’t have a scent at all. Personal preference, if the smell doesn’t bother you then it’s a perfectly fine moisturiser, works okay under makeup too. "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,makes my skin glow,I love this moisturizer so much. It absorbs into my skin beautifully and gives it a nice glow. I have oily skin and it doesn't make me more oily. In fact I have found my skin to be less oily since using it. I'll definitely be repurchasing. My only complaint is that it has been out of stock for ages and I need to get my hands on more. I'll be buying a few tubes next time it is available as it is so affordable. 
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,So affordable,Very affordable moisturiser. Works and described. Purchased for my partner who doesn't take that much effort with his skin. Good value and does the job!
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",USA,"The Inkey List Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer - 50ml(Original)","This is a really nice moisturizer. For the price point, I would definitely buy this again. I’m sure there are better ones out there but this is a great balance of cost and effectiveness."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,To oily ,"To oily and I have oily skin , so didn't go well,  gives acne problems, doesn't dry quick , hydrated way to much that gives me breakouts, didn't like."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Philippines,ms,"Too diluted, spills when pressed, and takes quite a long time to absorb, will not purchase again as was not happy with overall results ……………………………………………"
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",USA,Very Nice,"I liked this moisturizer, my mom loved it. We both found it particularly calming and lightweight. I have combination skin while she has very oily skin. I think this product is good for general use on a variety of skin types, also has a pleasant smell."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",USA,Great,This moisturizer is soooo nice. I use it in the morning and at night and it’s made my skin look very plump and vibrant. It isn’t too thick and has no weird smell. It’s amazing especially for the price
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,great,Great hydrating smooth moisturiser!  Such an affordable price. Been really happy with this product and other items from this brand. Will be purchasing again!! 
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",USA,Mediocre,This moisturizer was just alright. I felt like it did not really absorb into my skin and rather sat on top. I did not really notice any changes in my skin when using it. I also think that the packaging could be a little better. I liked that it was unscented as most scented moisturizers tend to irritate my skin. Overall you get what you pay for but this is good if you are just looking for something in a lower price range.
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Singapore,Good for oily skin!,I love this moisturizer! It doesnt break the bank and does the job. I have oily skin and this moisturizer works well for me because of the gel-ish texture. It works well under makeup too! 
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,All the vitamins for healthy skin,Great moisturiser for the price point. Very hydrating and absorbed super quickly into the skin. Not sticky or heavy but I do suggest reapplication during the day for best results. Fine for my very sensitive skin. I've finished this bottle so quickly. Will be sure to repurchase
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Philippines,okay moisturizer ,"i need a moisturizer for my oily face, and i saw this product on sephora. an affordable moisturizer to use daily (day and night). it has been weeks of using it and i see no difference in my skin ??? nothing special i guess?? 

beware of its product list; it contains coconut oil "
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Singapore,moist moist ,TikTok make me buy this! Heard many amazing reviews! So decided to give it a shot! Hopefully it works for my skin! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,miss,"very good product cleared my skin a lot and cleansed
my skin a lot and gave me full hydration and glow
with expholiation my skin has improved a lot a lot and
is making my confined very high because how good

"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Australia,Decent all rounder,"This is a great moisturiser for the price point! it's pretty light, so I like to use this one in summer and spring months when it's a bit warmer outside."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",USA,"The Inkey List Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer - 50ml(Original)","I love this moisturizer, Every product from the inkey list owns my heart! I love this moisturizer because I noticed a huge difference in my skin and my skin is also brighter and less dull"
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",USA,Good moisturizer but not life changing,"I really like this moisturizer because I feel like I am getting a lot of vitamins all at once and not having to use separate products. Although it probably isn't as effective as using the vitamins separately, my skin hasn't had a bad reaction to it so why not. This is a thick moisturizer but I don't know if I would use it as a night cream if I had dry skin, maybe normal. I use it only in the morning, and it melts into my skin nicely as long as I take the time to rub it in. This isn't a moisturizer that just melts in right away. I wish this came with a pump because it is thick and when using a new tube air bubbles can get trapped and burp product out, so I have accidentally spilled a bunch of it. Wish it was a little bigger because if you're using it day and night you will probably have to re-buy this roughly every month."
"THE INKEY LIST-Vitamin B, C And E Moisturizer",Singapore,review,"my skin felt moisturised throughout the day, and didnt feel uncomfortable, it had no sticky texture. its very affordable too! would definitely repurchase. "
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,Singapore,great,Been loving how this feels on my skin!! It feels really lightweight and gets absorbed into the skin relatively quickly too so it’s easy to incorporate into the skincare routine 
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,Australia,A MUST HAVE in your skincare routine!,"When Fentyskin released their first line of products (cleanser, fat water, hydravisor) I was so thrilled- however, not having a night cream to complete the package was so upsetting. Without it, my skin just wasn't getting all the love it needed.

This night cream has become a STAPLE to my skincare. It is so hydrating without being oily. I wake up of a morning with skin so soft, bright, and clear- no redness or blemishes. That said, I would highly recommend a sattin/silk pillow case to prevent product from rubbing off your face over night (otherwise it's a waste and you are less likely to see the best results).

If you have combination skin like me, this is the product for you. That said, I believe Rhianna has made these products for all skin types anyways."
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,Canada,Fenty Skin Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,"This is a genuine life saver! My skin is impossibly dry and angry through the colder months, and even in the summer with stress flare-ups, this night cream has rescued my face completely. It is gentle, easy to use, not sticky and smells super nice!"
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,Australia,love it! ,"This is my first refill. It lasted me way long to finish. Pretty easy to put in the old case just make sure to leave the peel off on because I made the mistake and couldn’t put it in the case without getting the cream everywhere. 

The actual cream is amazing hydrating and lightweight!"
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,Australia,Love this moisturiser. ,"Very hydrating saved my winter skin. Differences in skin ,pores & texture can be seen within days. It just smooths the skin . Reusable packaging and refills great idea. However, just wished it came in bigger size. 

"
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,Australia,pretty g,"I do quite like this product. if I'm honest I think that there are probably better and cheaper options on the market but this is nice. has a beautiful smell, it's v moisturising and it sits on the skin nicely. I do worry that it's fragranced though "
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,USA,Fenty Beauty Skin Care,I can not even begin to write how happy I am with this product. The difference I see and feel is amazing. I have tried so many other products and all I would have breakouts but with this product my face has been clear and pores smaller and facial lines are no fine you barely see them. I highly recommend.
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,New Zealand,Misleading,"Firstly the photo is misleading. You think you are buying the product and then you find out its a cheap plastic container of a refill. The smell is neutral and nice, but the consistency is too pasty. It does not feel like your skin absorbs it. It feels the cream stays on the top. Its very expensive for a refill and does not worth it. The Ole products are a bit cheaper and you can see the difference."
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,Australia,Eco friendly Refill ,"Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill
I am so in love with all things eco friendly that are from great producers. I honestly love container and the packaging. I just wish the cream was thicker and lasted longer. I only get about 12 weeks out of this product when used most night before bed. "
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,USA,Fenty Skin Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,"Pros of this product- everything! I have mature skin which is on the dry side and sensitive. This makes my skin feel amazing, well hydrated and without a lot of irritating fragrance. I apply this both in the morning before my foundation and then again at night before bed. I will definitely be buying this again."
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,Australia,Such a good quality/price product,"I use this not just as a night but as a day mosituriser (applying SPF prior). My skin is mixed, usually dry after cleansing but this moisturiser has been so great and ""has settled"" my skin better. The texture is awesome it still feels light on me but without compromising the hydration. I like the smell and I feel that the price/quality is spot on if not better!"
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,USA,A must have,Add this gel-cream to your nightly routine! The texture combines naturally with the Fat Watr serum. My skin always feels plump and hydrated.
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,USA,buy it,"I love this! It leaves my skin soft and hydrated, I usually apply in my face, neck and hands. Recommended"
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,Canada,Good hydration for the night,I personally love this product line including the night cream. It’s hydrating but not overwhelming. I like the light scent and it doesn’t linger so no issues after I go to bed. Not much to add just that it’s a decent product in a decent price range. And that enjoy the refill option.
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,Malaysia,Totally resets,"I’m in loveeeeee!! My skin loves this night cream. I can’t exactly afford it, so I used pea size every night. It moisturizes all night long. I’m on my third tub now. "

On initial use wasn’t a fan because it felt like it just sat on my face and didn’t seep through but now seeing the results I just can’t get enough!! Currently on my third refill!!"
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,Australia,refill awesome ,"I love the Fenty skin range. I also love the fact that you don't have to keep buying the whole pack, you just need to buy the refills. Just need a pea size amount and it goes a long way"
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,Singapore,Great product,Very hydrating. Keeps skin feeling juicy and bouncy. A good product for my skin. I have both dry and oily skin combination. Only reason why i give 4.5 stars is for the price. A bit on the pricey side. But good product over price? - Hmm why not.

FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,Malaysia,Good purchase,"I love the buttery feeling on my face, the texture is so light. It leaves a soft feeling the next day. Just like other Fenty Skin products, it has fragrance. So take note on that.
I bought the refill for first time use just to be cheap. I totally overlooked the fact that the lid is actually unsealable type because it is meant to be installed in its dedicated container. Now I'm feeling regret for getting it. When I'm restocking my supply, I'll definitely gonna get the one with the container, not the refill. I know you ppl are smart not to do my mistake."
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,New Zealand,Great product ,"This is a great night cream, skin feels great in the morning. Love how this is refillable. Price point slightly expensive for the amount of product.  
"
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,Malaysia,"Great texture, strong fragrance","My first foray to FS. While I like the texture, the fragrance is a smidge too strong for me. Not sure if I would repurchase, unless they tone down the fragrance. Otherwise, a brownie point for the ‘less packaging waste’ refill option"
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,New Zealand,First refill purchase - THAT good!!,"Just had to purchase a refill cause this lightweight moisture is holy grail!! Super moisturizing leaving skin looking and feeling oh so refreshed and hydrated. Am a bit suprized not all these ratings are a 5/5 as it TOTALLY deserves it, go on tey it yourself ;)"
FENTY SKIN-Instant Reset Overnight Recovery Gel-Cream Refill,Australia,love,love this creamy nourishing night moisturiser. I love that the outer package is reusable and you just replace the inner and the cute spatula that is in the lid. I have already bought a refill and am in love with this product. 
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Singapore,Very good,"Lancôme never goes wrong so far. I use this day and night. Light, non greasy but moisture. Good to apply then do some facial massage. Will apply this after Lancôme Génifique. "

My skin is very Oily and this gel make a perfect balance and not cause acne and control them"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Singapore,Great cream,Lancome's hydra zen moisturiser cream really helps to hydrate and destress my skin
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Pretty good,"Solid product. Spreads easily, cool feeling, matte finish. Contains both Alcohol Denat and Fragrance so can’t give it a 5 but I’ll give it a 4 I liked the texture and the fact that it did not irritate my sensitive skin."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Gentle enough for sensitive skin,"I don't know why but my skin acts up with most moisturizers except this one. I was getting frustrated because all the ones I had tried even for sensitive skin were giving me rashes or bumps on my face. This one works great, it is light and it moisturizes the skin."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Singapore,hydra with nice smell ,I really like the texture it so light weight and easily absorb. Like the luxury smell and just a little bit can smooth out the face. But price wise it still a bit high 
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Singapore,best moisturising,the smell is good and this is by far the best ive used. i have used it for 1 year and so far so good. what i really like is that it will not be sticky or oily after application. 
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,"I used the entire jar, which lasted a few months.  I like the texture and it left my skin soft and smooth, but I found the floral scent overwhelming.  I didn’t break out, but I wish it was scentless."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,"Oily skin saver, worth the money","I have extremely oily skin, but wow, this moisturizer is amazing! It doesn’t leave my skin oily, I can feel it working instead of sitting on-top of skin. My wrinkles are less visible, too. 
Pricy, but it’s worth it. I’ll be repurchasing for sure."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,"I have super sensitive, acne prone skin. I’ve been searching for a good moisturizer for years that wouldn’t dry, break out or irritate my skin. I got it as a sample with my Sephora rewards points and immediately bought the jar. My skin is now hydrated and soft. It’s my new holy grail product!  Just a warning, it has a really strong scent so it might not be ideal for those sensitive to fragrances."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,"Obsessed- If you suffer from acne, TRY THIS!",I have very acne prone skin and this moisturizer has been AMAZING! My acne has almost cleared up 100% from using this moisturizer. No irritation and super moisturizing! My only complaint is that it doesn't wear very well under my makeup and creates an uneven coverage. Also wish I could find a similar option that offers SPF!
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Awesome,"Really very good product, perfect for my combination skin."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,I can always count on you,Lord knows this is my Holy Grail! When in doubt I always go back to this. I’m on my jar #6.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,"I can't tell if I like this product or not. It absorbs fast, but on my skin it feels like it locks in moisture more than moisturizes."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Add to cart!,This I love! Lightweight and refreshing! Hydrates skin without that greasy feel.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,I’m Bad At Explaining,"I have the sample of this and i have struggled trying to find a good moisturizer. this is one of those, dare i say, holy grail of moisturizer?? yes. it doesn’t leave the skin feeling sticky, it feels like silk and you wake up the next day and see a difference in your skin after your bedtime routine. i do skincare twice a day and have been seeing immediate results after I wanna say three nights and thats fast compared to other moisturizers. but i will say everyone of us will experience something different! I also have oily skin and this has not made it worse at all. Wish i could explain this better. I hope you guys have just a great experience with it as i did. if you’re curious about it i definitely say give this a try"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,"Love this moisturizer, it absorbs quickly & does not leave my skin looking shiny. It works well under my spf as well."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,dried me up and broke me out,"Initially, this felt luxurious and nice on my skin. A few days later, I’m peeling and start to get large bumps/breakouts in places that I never break out on my face. I wanted to love this because of all the rave reviews. I was thoroughly confused at how awful my skin reacted to it - and it normally doesn’t. I used this along with the toner and it was a big no no. My skin became super dry and flaky. Had to rerun."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,extremely fragranced,I received a sample of this. This is extremely heavily fragranced with a rose scent. It smells like an actual rose perfume. I washed it off immediately since I thought that couldn't be good for skin.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,phenomenal!!!,i have keratosis pilaris (small white bumps under my skin that are not white heads) all over my face and haven’t been able to find a product that smoothes my skin out without drying it. this product made my skin look amazing! after one night my skin looked great and super smooth. the salicylic acid in it really helps and i still felt super moisturized. would highly recommend.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,I got this as a rewards item. I was pleasantly surprised that it didn’t make my skin super oily like most moisturizers do even when they say oil free. I also  was looking at my face last night and thought it looked clearer. I was confused as to why. I came on here to buy the full product and saw that there is salicylic acid in it and thought oh that must be why. Also a little goes a long way. I used the 0.16 oz sample for 7 days straight. The one thing I would change is the fragrance. It smells nice to me but I don’t think smells are necessary in face products.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Awesome,I got this as a free sample and I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked just after one use! My skin is baby soft and it didn’t make me feel oily after applying! Will be buying the full size when I can afford it.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,"quick dry, nongreasy","I bought full size after receiving sample..I have used many moisturizers (47 and fighting off wrinkles for years!!) this is one of my favorites, dries quickly, not oily feeling, fine lines look better and my pores have gotten smaller..love this"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Malaysia,not bad ,"Does not really work for my skin, I have combination dry skin, I need to apply multiple layers to stay hydrated. But if u have dry skin I would recommend this. Easily absorbed "
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Singapore,Mgr ,"I Love the scent, it is non greasy and has a fresh sensation on the skin. Slight Cooling effect as well, it is great for hot humid weather and sensitive reactive skin like mine. 
"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Malaysia,Mr,"It does what it said, a plumping soft gel cream, rosy smell which relaxing ur skin for each application without any oiliness. Fast absorption which pumping moisture deep 
into your skin. Love it, just a little bit pricy…"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Malaysia,Good,bila pakai rasa melekit sikit tapi not too bad best jee sebab ad bau mcm rose. dh pakai almost 3 month tp still banyak lagi. sangatla berbaloi. will repeat this order 
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Australia,Amazing hydration,"I ran out of this product so swapped to a different moisturiser. My skin quickly became dull and dehydrated. I’ve since purchased hydra zen gel again and I love the hydration, I love the light texture that glides onto the skin and soaks in without feeling greasy. Can’t recommend it enough."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Fantastic moisturizer,I have dry/normal combo skin that is easily irritated. I love this moisturizer. The balance of hydration and salicylic acid works great for my skin - even when my dermatitis is acting up. The light rose scent goes away quickly for me. which is good since I can get scent-related migraines.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,LOVE this sooo hydrating ! Last all day and not sticky at all it has a light weight texture to it and a little goes along way so does last a while I absolutely love this moisturizer
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Australia,Soft and smooth,I have been using this product for many years. Although my skin is a little older now I continue to use this product as it is not too heavy and suits my skin
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Singapore,Texture and smell is different from previous batch ,Been use it for quite sometimes but the recent purchase seems to be different from the previous batch. This time the cream gel is not as concentrated and the smell is not as strong. Don’t know anyone have the same experience as me? 
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Silky light hydration,This is a wonderfully hydrating moisturizer for all skin types. It’s silky and feels so good on the skin. It absorbs completely leaving behind a smooth surface. I love to use this right out of the shower before I put on my makeup.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Sticky and Made My Eyes Sting & Water,"I'm trying every possible (and affordable) moisturizer for aging, dry, and sensitive skin.  Lancome Hydra Zen Gel-Creme Hydrant Anti-Stress Moisturizing Cream-Gel was my most recent experiment and, unfortunately, it was a FAIL.  

I used it alone with no foundation over it, so I could evaluate it properly.  I wore it all day.  I found that my eyes stung and watered all day long, and the moisturizer remained very sticky on my skin instead of feeling smooth.

The next day, I used a different moisturizer (one that doesn't moisturize enough, but doesn't feel sticky or make my eyes sting), to make sure it was the cream and not some other environmental cause.  Sure enough, no stinging eyes, no sticky residue.

Then I tried the Hydra Zen on the next day, and the stinging eyes returned along with the stickiness.

What I want in a moisturizer is:
Silky smooth application
Subtle glow
Skin that feels protected/moisturized all day long
No allergic reactions around eyes or on skin
No stickiness
Can be used with foundation without pilling

I can't understand why this is so difficult to find???  The previous moisturizer that I loved was discontinued, which is why I'm having to find a new one."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Singapore,MFG 01/2020,"Order on 10/10, received the product on 14/10, the delivery quit fast. the product was manufacturing on 01/2020. Not really a new stock. Not so satisfy for this order. Hope Sephora can do better. If want ro clear old stock should mention to consumer."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Singapore,Loving the smell!,"Product absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave behind any oily residue, face is also matt and soft after application. Love the nice scent too! Would love the lid to be made of better quality though, the plastic is quite flimsy and not very smooth to close."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,"So it’s got fragrances in it and so on... this review is for those who these kinds of brands cater to and without sensitive skin (honestly I would stay away from Lancôme if you’re purging or have easily irritated skin - it’ll make the irritation worse, and the negatives of using it outweigh the positives.) That being said, if you like prefer school brands that are about luxury/the experience of skincare, this is a solid option. It’s light and smells beautiful, and has salicylic acid in it."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,PERCECT CURE FOR MASKNE,I was recommended this product for anyone needing immediate treatment for acne and anyone looking to maintain clear and balanced skin during this mask mandate. its truly a remarkable moisturizer and hydrates without disrupting the natural oils in your skin.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,perfect for oily and dry skin,This has been my favorite moisturizer for the past 3 yrs. I am on my 4th jar and about to repurchase again. light scent that goes away. my skin feels so smooth and fresh. I have dry skin over most of my face and slightly oily on nose and chin and this works great on whole face. like it balances my skin. highly recommend.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Singapore,D,"Love this! So moisturizing and the consistency is so soft and supple, it literally melts right into my skin. It smells beautiful as well. Feels really luxurious using this."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Fantastic!,"Great basic daily moisturizer. It feels good, absorb fast and leave my skin soft. It even holds in FL humidity!"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Does the job,"I do like this moisturizer, but I like Clinique Moisture Surge better. This is a little heavier and maybe NOT something for summer time."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Tried and true,"It's the best. Rose is the best for my skin and absorbs very quickly. I'm the kind of person who sleeps face first into my pillow, so anything that sits or lingers on my face picks up lint/particles that make my face breakout. This is perfect for morning and night before sunscreen:)"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Singapore,hydra zen moisturising cream gel ,Really like it after using this product it does not feel sticky after apply on it it abosrb real quick . Wanted purchase the whole series to try outtt 
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,Absolutely love this moisturizer. Hydrating & lightweight. It’s smells amazing too.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Canada,Highly recommended!,"I've been using this moisturizer as my daily morning hydrator and it is everything. It's light and keeps my skin smooth, hydrated, and even plump. The fragrance is natural and great for sensitive skin as even no-scent skincare sometimes has to be processed to take away scents. The best thing about Hydra Zen is that I used to suffer from breakouts often, (I have oily/combination skin) but Hydra Zen fixed this in a week. Highly recommended!"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Malaysia,so-so moisturizer ,"i don’t think the smell could make you calm or stress reliever or what so ever. for me the rose scent is quite strong and kind of annoying. it absorbs real quick and has the cooling effects. it hydrates my skin but i need to applied other moisturizer on top to seal the hydration. otherwise my skin will feel dry after few minutes application. Other than hydrating, i couldn’t see any improvement on my skin. therefore, i will not repurchase. 
"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Singapore,Hydrating,"Received a lancome skincare gift set from a friend and started loving lancome skincare products! Decided to buy this cream and it is so hydrating. It also gives off a nice subtle scent of the rose and it doesn’t leave my skin all oily at the end of the day. Even though it is slightly pricey, but overall I will re-purchase it again. One bottle can last me about 4-6 months!"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Australia,"Great features,  skin looks smoother","i bought this product a month ago, although the shipping took a bit longer than expected, the product is great, matches perfectly for combination skin and works amazing!"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,Made me break out :( I have never had acne on my chin until I tried using this. The acne resolved once I stopped using it.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Singapore,nice scent,I get this as sample from my previous purchase of night repair. Don’t expect this is so good. It moisturize and leave a good scene. Enjoy applied it day and night. Will consider repurchase

LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,I'm in Love,Best moisturizer I've ever used.  Perfect texture and consistency.  Perfectly effective and smells divine.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,"Solid moisturizer, but contains Sal Acid","This moisturizer worked well for my acne prone skin. It's very light, but somehow still pretty hydrating. I would note, it does contain salicylic acid, so you might want to think twice before using this if you use any retinol in your routine. I have found that the amount of salicylic acid in it is just enough improve the brightness of my skin without creating any dryness issue. Overall, it's a good daily/nightly moisturizer. I've purchased twice and will purchase again."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,So good!!,Tried the sample of this and I had to purchase it. Really a good moisturizer after the toner for my skin because it gets dry.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Not worth it,I have very dry skin so I decided to try it out. Honestly not worth the price. It does smell amazing but I used the whole  thing and did not see any difference on my skin. My skin felt like it needed more moisture even after I applied plenty.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,"A Must Have, so worth it","Love, love, love! I have tried lots of moisturizers before this one and at first I got it as sample to try and I fell in love with it. Love the smell, the texture, feel good on my skin and it absorbs well and fast. And my skin looks great all day and  healthy. My skin is normally very dry and I have tried lots of brands before that didn’t work as well as this one, it is more expensive but it’s worth the price and will continue to use this in my daily routine."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,no makeup selfie,"Stressed out / combo skin - this is your saving grace!  I hardly do reviews - but felt compelled after just a couple days of use! Amazing! If you are looking for something to soak up, not greasy at all - but still moisturize and calm that stressed out skin , this is for you!"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Broke me out. Not even moisturizing,Terrible product. Broke me out on face area. Then I used it on my neck just to make sure it was this product breaking me out and guess what? Got instant breakouts on my neck as well! Besides all that- it does not feel moisturizing at all.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Sensitive skin,"I have sensitive combo skin and am prone to annoying, random acne (not all over, just occasional spots). I've been using it for two months now, and it does not cause me to break out. I LOVE the strong rose scent, but it may be too strong for some people. The gel moisturizer feels luxurious - a unique texture and great under makeup. Not too drying for me, but I typically follow up with a moisturizing tinted BB cream."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,So so,"I love a good gel moisturizer for the summer when I want to stay hydrated but without the heavy feeling of some rich cream moisturizers. I have combination skin that tends to get oilier during the hot months, but I personally didn’t like this one that much. First of all the ingredients listed are not my favorite for my skin (dimethicone, alcohol denat), and second the scent is just too strong for me even tho fragrance is listed as the last ingredient, it’s very floral very classic Lancôme if you will, just wish high end brands would leave fragrance out of skincare. I just think there are better options out there for a more affordable price tag and better ingredients. Packaging wise of course it is gorgeous! But that’s not enough to justify use for me. I received this product complimentary but all opinions are my own."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,"I love the cool and calming effects of this moisturizer and it definitely does it’s job to keep my skin hydrated and soft all day. I’m sure so sure about the anti-stress effect. However, this product has a STRONG perfumey smell and I would prefer my face products to have a mild smell. I believe my skin started to break out because of that so I stopped using it. I received this product free for testing purposes."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Awful Ingredients and Not Cruelty Free,"As someone who always reviews ingredients on products and cares about what I put on my skin, I was appalled at some of the ingredients. 1) Alpha Isomethyl Ionone is a fragrance ingredient that must be listed on products that contain it due to its high risk of causing a sensitized reaction (aka - avoid it if you have sensitive skin). Other “fragrance” ingredients such as eugenol, Rosa gallica and butylphenyl methylpropional are included and are equally bad for your skin. I thought the product was sticky and the smell was way too strong. Lastly, this company sells their products in China, where by law it requires all imported cosmetics to be tested on animals. Between the awful ingredients and the company not being cruelty free, I would not recommend this product. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Another no-go from this line!,"This has a horrid smell! It’s pungent! It's like walking into your grandmas room after she’s sprayed way too much rose perfume. I recommend going in-store to take a whiff before purchasing. I’m not sensitive to smells at all but this is just over the top. As far as the cream itself, It absorbs into the skin very quickly which is great for people with oily skin. Though I didn’t see any reduction in redness or instant radiance. I don’t think this will offer enough hydration for people with dry skin though. I have oily-combo and it just wasn’t as hydrating as I’m used to these days. My emulsion (which I’m using in place of a moisturizer this Summer) is more hydrating than this cream. Which says a lot since emulsions are just water-based."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Not for me,"I received this product as a promotion for my review. The scent was so strong I couldn’t use it. Lancôme, in general, has a super strong synthetic smell that gives me a headache."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Absolutely Perfect in Every Way,"The scent. The feel of it on the skin. The whole product is a rich lotion that is perfect for those “anti-stress” moments in life. I tried the mini, but I’m definitely going to have to save my $$$ up for this."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Light moisturizer,This is a nice light moisturizer.  It didn't irritate my skin.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,LOVE!,"I got this with my beauty points and it's my new favourite moisturiser! My skin has been really stressed lately, what with the cold weather causing red patches and dryness. I put this on at night after my Kiehls midnight serum and I wake up with gorgeous, fresh glowing skin! I have also used it under make up and my skin just looks really bright and much healthier. I really like the cream-gel formula, feels very nice as it sinks into your skin. Will definitely buy the full size of this."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Glowing not Greasy,"My skin is the definition of stressed! Combination EVERYTHING and changes problems constantly so I need a ton of different products for each issue. Before I tried this it was super dry/sensitive from the strong salicylic acid pads I used to treat breakouts.  

This worked great for me because it moisturized enough to keep my skin balanced without going back to oily/greasy. My skin usually never glows but after putting this on it looks healthy and fresh! I love it!"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,"I really enjoy the feel of the moisturizer, however the scent is extremely overpowering. The gel did keep my skin very happy through the day, but in the end the scent was too strong."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,"First of all, I LOVE the packaging. Second, I find this formulation of this product to be simply lovely. I enjoy a moisturizer that isn’t too greasy and this hits the spot. Light, yet still deeply moisturizing. I received this free from Influenster to try out."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Made me break out,"The consistency is great and it smells really good, it would be a great night-time cream but...it made me break out. I guess my skin is too sensitive."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,"Not for me, but for others, it's great","As a girl who likes to pour money into skincare product, I was interested to see the effectiveness of this moisturizer. Before I start off with the moisturizer itself, I want to take a moment to compliment the design of this bottle- it is very luxurious feeling and makes your skincare lineup look very fancy. Moving onto the moisturizer, I was initially in love with it, but my skin was not. I have sensitive skin, and my body loves to react angrily whenever I put on something that does not agree with me. The Lancome-iconic fragrance, this time rose, was not friendly to my sensitive skin. The texture and finish of the moisturizer is very light and leaves a dewy look on the skin, but it was just that. Maybe it was because of its lightness, but my skin never felt the hydration that I have experienced with some other brands. And as someone who lives in a polluted urban environment, I need hydration to keep my skin afloat. Overall, I would recommend this product to someone who does not have my skin issues, most likely an oily-normal skin type, as they may find this product to be just what they need in their lives."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Canada,"Light, non greasy feel",(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have been using my hydra zen moisturizer that I received in exchange for a review and have been very pleased.  It has a light and non greasy feel that makes my skin feel invigorated and restored.  Great to use under makeup and causes no oil or caking
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,I got a sample size of this product with my Beauty Insider points and I think it was made for oily skin because it is the TOTAL OPPOSITE of hydrating. I put it on before bed and woke up with flakey dry patches all over my face.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Not Hydrating Enough/Broke Me Out,"This moisturizer feels really good on the skin for about 20 minutes and then I start to get dry patches. For me, (I have combination, sensitive, acne-prone skin) this just wants hydrating enough, especially in the winter time. It resulted in my T-zone producing more oil/sebum and break-outs. I switched to using Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide and Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream that both helped my skin restore its natural barrier and stay hydrated."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,best calming moisturizer -- the holy grail!!,"This product has helped my skin tremendously. I have extremely sensitive skin. I am always dry or breakout. I have allergic reactions too all of the time.  Nothing seemed to ever help it and I've tried EVERYTHING. And now recently pregnant, I have developed a terrible rash on my face. I got this as a sample and then bought it. It cleared up everything virtually in days. my holy grail❤"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Best Ever!,"Best Ever, I got it as a sample and now I'm ordering the full size."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,fab product,"Smells fantastic, goes on light, makes my skin feel soft and refreshed. It keeps my oil down as well."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,I received this product for free for testing purposes from influenster. I have a oily skin and it doesn’t Do much for me. I’ll keep using it and see if anything changes.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,I received this product from Influenster in exchange for a review. It smells amazing and is definitely high quality. I have used it for about two weeks and my skin feels amazing. I would purchase this product.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,Canada,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) My face feels very moist without feeling too oily which I love and it’s feels very light on the skin. I do feel like I need to use a little bit more than my usual moisturizer because it is very thin
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,This is very moisturizing and has a light-ish he’ll feel.  It does take a long time to fully absorb but requires very little product to treat full face. Before fully absorbing it feels very plastic-y and sticky. It is worth a try but it was not for me. I ended up having a negative skin reaction.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Not Hydrating,"It smells so good, but did no type of hydrating  whatsoever! I would love to know what this scent is because it is relaxing"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Complementary from Influenster,I received this complimentary from Influenster and I have only used it 3 times I absolutely love it so far. I’ll come back in a month and give a better review. But I honestly love how it makes my skin look and feel so far. I’m excited to see how how much better my skin gets with each use!
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Works great and prevents dry patches,I bought a sample size with my rewards points for my wife and she loves it. She ended up purchasing the actual item and applies it every night after applying the hydrating essence. Her face is dry and she gets dry patches on her face. Sometimes it gets puffy and red and looks pretty bad (especially during the winter and in dry weather). She hasn't had that problem since she's been using this.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Calms my acne prone skin,"I have very sensitive, oily, acne prone skin with some minor scarring. 
I’m very careful when it comes to skincare and makeup, and while I’ve always loved Lancôme for foundation and other makeup I’ve never ventured into their skincare lines. Until now. This moisturizer is lightweight and the smell is so pleasant! I have had a decrease in pimples and it keeps my skin very balanced.
complimentary for testing purposes."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Love it!,"I love this moisturizer!! The only downside to it is the strong smell. It’s not a bad smell, just one i normally would not prefer on my face. Overall, it is very hydrating, but not too much. I have very oily skin and I live in Mississippi- this did not make me oily at all, even out in the Heat! I would highly suggest this product."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Great for my oily skin,"First and foremost I must state that I received this item complimentary in my voxbox but all opinions are true and my own. Now that that’s out of the way I have to say I was very skeptical about switching up my skin care routine. For those of you with oily skin, like myself, you know once you find what works to control your oil, the slightest thought of changing that routine can send you into a downward spiral! I decided to finally give it a chance after staring at the beautiful package sitting on my makeup vanity for about a week, and to my surprise I loved it! Lancôme never fails to have elegant packing and effective products. Being that it’s a gel moisturizer I thought it would be tacky and just sit on the surface, but it doesn’t leave a tacky residue at all and I feel completely hydrated after using it. I replaced my AM and PM moisturizer with this, and a little goes a long way! A tiny bit on the tip of my finger covers my entire face and neck. So it’s definitely a good bang for the buck. I’ve been using it for almost a month now and it looks like I haven’t even touched it, it’ll definitely last a while even when using it twice a day. I honestly have nothing bad to say about it because I believe this is the perfect moisturizer for my skin. I’ll for sure be repurchasing once I finish with this one."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,"I got this from Influenster to test. It reminds me of Origins Original Skin line. Or Tatcha WaterGel. It lands somewhere in between those two. I have oily skin in the summer and this did not make my skin more oily. I didn’t notice a huge scent enough to bother me. It moisturizes and keeps my face soft all day. Also, I have not broken out from using it."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Best moisturizer,"Amazing product it was sent to me via influenster, left my skin so soft and hydrated . Smells amazing,  the formula is so rich and smooth. Definitely worth the price."
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,best moisturizer ever.,"i first got a small sample of this moisturizer at my local sephora and immediately fell in love. being a college student, it can be hard to justify such big purchases, but this moisturizer makes my skin feel incredibly silky and have a very soft, beautiful glow. i don’t know if i can ever go without this again, so i bought a full sized jar and regret nothing!"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,I love it it feels so good perfect for sensitive skin and dry skin to be honest all skin types
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,"I received this free from Influenster to test out and I must say, it's pretty amazing! it's so hydrating but doesnt have a sticky feel after application. it's so lightweight!"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,It’s lovely,"Wonderful, lightweight, hydrating cream.  It absorbs quickly and smells delightful!"
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Lancôme Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel - 50ml,Love the hydration and glow.  Did not leave my skin oily.
LANCÔME-Hydra Zen Anti-Stress Moisturising Cream-Gel,USA,Great,Absolutely perfect moisturizer for me. I apply it before bad after cleaning face.My face is so much hydrated.
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,am luckyyy,"Clean-excellently! I will definitely repurchase, like always via Sephora the cheapest compare to other platform... It is very important to use skincare so that our face will forever beautiful"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,hmm,i got this cause i wanted to try retinols but am too scared. it’s ok i guess. i’m not sure what this is supposed to do. i feel the same. my world has not been rocked. i guess at least it didn’t broke me out? i don’t think i’ll repurchase.
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,nice ,I am using it in the place of retinol since I was pregnant and breastfeeding now..prefer bakuchiol since it is less intense compared to retinol but deliver the same result..no peeling on my skin..
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Singapore,smells funky but works,"the cream smells like fish oil at the start but the smell mellows out after applying. feels very nice ok the skin, non greasy but hydrating. would purchase again. the tube is not the best for this though. the cream is more liquid so it flows out. "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,my husband's favourite moisturiser ,"I love this product and so does my husband. It does have an earthy scent, but it doesn't bother us. It absorbs quickly and has great results, another great product at a great price."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Canada,"Good idea, terrible result","I was so excited about this product because I have sensitive skin. After using an entire tube, I have not noticed any difference in skin texture -- EXCEPT that my forehead is now covered in non-acne bumps. Would not recommend for combination or oily skin."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Bakuchiol Moisturizer,"It's rare to get results while spending so little. I've been mixing a pea sized amount with my moisturizer a.m. and p.m. for the last few weeks, and my skin shows a noticable difference. More even tone, smaller looking pores, softer appearance. All with zero irritation.
The improvements are subtle, but enough for me to continue to repurchase again and again. It's a new staple for me. 
This does have a noticable, natural (plant?) like scent. Doesn't bother me, but might turn some people off. It's also a booster, not a stand-alone moisturizer. I suppose it could be used as a moisturizer, but it'll be gone FAST if used in that way.
If you're curious about bakuchiol, you can't go wrong trying this!"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,Brightening for sensitive skin,Nice moisturizing retinol alternative for sensitive skin.
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Bakuchiol Moisturizer,My skin really did not like this:( I tried. So far the two products I’ve tried from the inkey list have been awful! I actually liked the smell.
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,the smell! ,I won’t be buying this again. I was excited for this product but the smell wasn’t great and I found it would pill when I got to the stage of applying makeup. I was excited for this product and was hoping it would be the answer for when I’m pregnant. 
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,Perfect lasting moisture on a budget,"This makes the skin feel so soft and plump instantly on application, and never greasy feel on the skin the whole time it's on your skin. it lasts as long as an entire day and night - I end up needing to wash my face or hands before I can find out if this stops making my face feel moisturized after applying it.
Prices for the most basic, greasy, fragrance filled or essential oil packed creams are outrageous these days even for newly launched products unless I turn to Korean or Japanese skincare brands. So I am happy this is so budget friendly & packs so much moisture in the smallest drop on the skin. For this steal of a price, I have now made it my hand moisturizer too as I hate feeling or smelling lotion on my hands when I need to grab food to eat it, or the alternative being when I need to wash my hands more frequently than ever in this day and age, and my moisturizer just comes off & it's a waste of product. I still feel the conditioning effect on my hands if I have to wash my hands an hour after application, so I can forgive the slightly odd smell (which goes away fairly quickly) and slightly too runny formulation for the packaging, but since it's not wasteful at all (as you can simply but through the top of the bottle to get every last drop), I'd much rather that than have to increase the price for fancier or bulkier packaging.
I've seen some comments say this is not retinol - yes, that's what it means by ""alternative"": Skin experts are always emphasizing there is currently no better researched and effective anti-aging and photo-damage repairing ingredient than retinoic acid, as not even all retinoids are the same. And of course this is all only if you use SPF daily as directed. This is where you need to do your own research for what best suits your needs - and you can't knock a brand for telling you the potential bakuchiol certainly does have in helping your skin in some ways certain retinoids can."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,Misleading,This Moisturiser has a thin cream texture and a bit of a scent. It breaks me out a bit and the amount you get is minisucle. My biggest issue with this is the false marketing. Bakchuiol is NOT an alternative to retinol and natural doesn't mean better. Bakchuiol is an antioxidant like vitamin c and functions as such but you cannot replace retinol with this.
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Canada,"If you can’t handle retinols, you can handle this!",The bakuchiol needs more LOVE! My skin is SO sensitive to all retinols. They make my face burn. But this?!?! No burning AND my skin is looking great! It definitely brightened up my complexion by a lot and even soothed my acne. Give it a try!evhelped
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,Bakuchiol,"I have oily-combo, acne prone skin. I've tried retinol before but it can cause my skin to be sensitive. Bakuchiol is an alternative and I think this has been amazing! Its thinly spreadable but is very moisturising and I wake up with smooth, soft skin. 

It leaves a bit of a scent, a sort of ginseng/ginger blend. It leaves my skin brighter and improves texture. I think it works really well and I can't wait to repurchase!"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,You get what you pay for. Save your money,"Don't buy this. I used a tiny bit through a pin hole at the bottom of the bottle. This is like mixing regular lotion and a lot of water, Smells bad. They can't even package it correctly."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,i love it,i always purchase this for my mum because she loves it. leaves the skin super protected and nice and its gorgeous but it smells like... celery 
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Philippines,great for my oily skin,"Easily absorbed in my skin.. does not make my skin oily during the day, does not irritate my skin
free. Tried other products but inkey list is such a dependable and reliable brand. I have been maintaining this among other products of inkey list in my skincare to prevent the return of my hormonal acne. I also took borage oil supplement. "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Bakuchiol Moisturizer,"I really like this moisturizer. Initially, I disliked the smell (I assume it’s the natural smell of bakuchiol), but I’ve come to really love it. It’s a super lightweight moisturizer - I use it almost as a thick serum, with either a thicker moisturizer or sunscreen over top for more hydration since I have dry skin. Does it work for anti aging? No idea. It’s certainly not a magic bullet. But it’s an affordable, very lightweight moisturizer that works in my routine and *may* have some anti-aging benefits, so I enjoy continuing to use it."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,Bakuchiol Moisturiser ,I was really pleasantly surprised with this moisturiser. It had a lovely texture and as Bakuchiol is a retinol alternative it didn’t leave any stinging or drying out of my skin. If you’re interested in an alternative I would definitely recommend this. 
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Singapore,meh,"cheap moisturiser which doesn't do much. such a pity, I wanted to love it"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,New Zealand,Great intro to retinol-like products!,"I absolutely love this. The texture is really light and absorbs into the skin. It has made my skin feel soooo smooth and clear, and has reduced a lot of oiliness and texture I usually struggle with. Works amazing under make up too!!"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,so good,"this product does what it says, I was surprised with the price it's a gorgeous moisturiser smells good too. helps with keeping plump. beautiful under make-up "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,New Zealand,Pretty good,I do like this moisturiser however it’s my first Bakuchiol product and I do find the smell quite intense. My skin feels nicely moisturised and lasts all day. Very good price. Unsure if I’ll repurchase or try something else. 
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,New Zealand,Bakuchiol Moisturizer,"The Inkey List Bakuchiol Moisturizer 
For me , it did absolutely nothing for my skin It’s a Great price but can’t see that it did anything to be honest "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Bakuchiol Moisturizer,basically does nothing for me after a month but good price with good ingredients.
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,Cult product - must buy!,"Easily one of my favourite moisturisers I've ever purchased! Smells like ginseng. I have very sensitive skin and this is fine for me. This is the best moisturiser I use in this brand and I highly recommend trying it. Easily a lot better than other competitor bakuchiol moisturisers and much cheaper. In as little as a week or two, you can see why there's a hype around bakuchiol moisturisers!"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Singapore,Good,"Works just as good as retinol but much more gentle. It can be used on its own and even with serums. On days where I want my skin to rest, I would just use this alone and wake up with a brighter complexion. Only thing I don't like is the packaging, the cream will get all over the lids and waste a bit of the product if not stored properly. Overall, not too bad."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,Great moisturiser,This moisturiser is great especially for summer as it's lightweight and sinks into your skin very easily. I would definitely repurchase again on my next order
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,received exploded product,"received a dirty box with a dirty bottle and empty bottle, customer service is replacing it"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,Very bad smell,I had a terrible time getting through this moisturizer. I've wanted to try bakucial for awhile but I definitely won't buy this one again. This product smells absolutely awful. I personally can't get past the awful smell. If they decide to reformulate I might try again. For now I'll definitely look for something else instead.
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,Ms.,"It does make a difference, not oily and blends well with my make up. My dry skin slowly improving and less fine lines, i have acne prone skin and this moisturizer does not cause any breakout."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Singapore,Amazing product!,"I am totally in love with this! I usually use it at night cause idk it works better for me i guess? But its a really amazing product, plus the fact that its like a more natural form of retinol apparently so i wasnt really afraid it would like make my skin bad or whatever like how retinol reacts to other peoples skin. This is perfect i tell you! Its really really really perfect! "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,wonderful ,"unlike retinol, bakuchiol doesn't purge my skin and it works wonderful for me, I can see the glow and those tiny dark spots  are gone! loving this product and will continue purchasing! "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Canada,A must have,"Amazing product!!!  
I can already see a difference in my skin after a few days of use. I purchased it as an alternative to Retinol as it causes sensitivity and redness. My skin is softer and more luminous. The dry patches around my nostrils and just below my eyebrow are gone. Will purchase again."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,I think it works ,"I started using this in the morning after skin care prior to suncream and makeup mostly because it's lightweight but feels like it provides decent moisture. 
When I finished it I started to think my skin looked worse / lack luster and then realised it could be due to missing this so I repurchased and after a week or so felt like my skin was looking better / plumper.
it's a great product."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Philippines,A ok,"Its a fairly good moisturizer, its unscented so its great for sensitive skin. I suggest this for those who are not into retinol. i read a lot of good reviews about bakuchiol i hope this is effective"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Bakuchiol Moisturizer,"Amazing! Perfect dewy feeling, I love this product better than retinol depending on the phase of your life you’re in."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,I LOVE this!!! ❤️,"Super moisturiser, light but it really does the job over night. Love it! The price point of this brand is insane but I am extremely pleased about it. I am so sick of paying through the teeth for stuff that barely works. This stuff works, the entire brand has fabulous stuff and I have been using it mostly for moisturising, uneven skin tone, hyper pigmentation and some light scarring and I can already see a difference. I WILL be buying backups this week I’m not even waiting to run out of anything, best skin care I’ve found for a LONG time, especially at this price. "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Singapore,My friend loves it,"I ordered this for my friend. She loves it. She said this hydrate her face well without causing any breakout. With the price point, this is valued item."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,Decent moisturiser,This is a decent moisturiser. Not sure how much of a difference it has made to my skin but it definitely hasn't made me break out. Smell may be a bit off putting to some but it goes away quickly
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,best moisturizer ,"the inkey list product never goes wrong in my skin. I can see different/ improvement on my face after used for few days. price also reasonable and small size for traveling
 "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,not bad,"This is a nice decent moisturiser, the smell is quite strong but I can get past it. The tube size is very small, and I haven’t been using it long enough to see any proper results yet. "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,Nice Moisturiser  ,I've been using this for a couple of weeks now. I think it's still too early to see results. I will say it sits lovely on the skin and doesn't leave an oily residue. My makeup sits well over the top. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the smell but it goes away fairly quickly. 
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Singapore,good for my sensitive skin,works well on my sensitive skin—there's the non-smell smell which takes some getting used to but not a dealbreaker!
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,Control breakouts ,"Have a sensitive skin and whenever I use a new product usually will get breakout but this product doesn’t. Sits well on the skin although due to my oily skin, it gets oily fast. Apart from that it moistures the skin well. Perhaps will repurchase again.
"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Singapore,Excellent ,Love this moisturizer. It is lightweight and hydrating. No irritation or acne from this gentle moisturizer.I particularly love the soft minty smell of this mositurizer .Will keep on buying this .
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,New Zealand,Bakuchiol Moisturiser ,Unfortunately I found no benefits in using this product. I found it dried my skin out a lot and looked flaky when applied under my makeup. The bottle seemed like it was half full when I got it and didn’t last long at all. I didn’t notice any ‘anti-ageing’ benefits either. Wouldn’t repurchase or recommend. The only positive I can add is that it didn’t make me break out. 
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Singapore,Meh Moisturizer ,"Trendy new ingredient, formulation is ok, did not break out my skin however because it is so liquidy it doesn't feel like anything on the skin. I used it as a night moisturizer but i always feel like i need a other layer of cream to properly moisturize. "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,ms.,"i love how fast the product absorbed into my skin! it does wonder too. basically this is the alternative to retinol with slight differences. definitely worth to try and buy. bakuchiol is also safe for pregnant & bf mummy so you wouldn't regret this. the only concern is the smell, but you'll get used to it after a while. overall, it is great!"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,stinky inky ,"the smell is horrible but have found a great change in my skin.

I also have sensitive skin and have found this works great for the price point. 

would be amazing if the smell was better 
"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,Calms redness,Im loving this! It calms redness on my face. I used this after my Microdermabrasion treatment. Substitute my Retinol too! Inkey list has very straightforward and effective ingredients
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,Retinol Option,Choose bakuchiol over retinol and my skin love bakuchiol more. There is no purging for my skin due to using basic skincare routine. Love this moisturizer a lot. 
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,Awesome product and an even better price.,"I am on my 4th tube of this stuff, and it is great. I have noticed the deep lines on my forehead and neck reduced using it once a day before bed and before applying moisturizer."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,Great option for those who want a natural retinol!,"Not crazy about the smell from the phenoxyethanol, but otherwise seems great. For those that have issues, open from the cap size up and the crimped side down and push it out. Problem solved. Do not pour it directly in your hand. I have only tried it once so far but no skin burning which usually happens pretty much immediately. I am really hoping it works. I loved my other Bakuchiol serum until I became allergic. All other companies use essential oils like limonene or linalool that cause allergic reactions over time for some people and you never know if you will become one. Also limonene or essential oils that contain it like citrus oils and lemongrass create formaldehyde when exposed to the air. It is a thinner lotion but this is for wrinkles, not a moisturizer. I am hoping that it works well! If it does as well as my last serum the results should be great. Bakuchiol has been shown to work as effectively as retinol if it is used twice daily."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Bakuchiol Moisturizer,"My skin gets a little dry during winter time (whatever winter we have here in San Diego); I wasn’t expecting much of this product but decided to give it a try anyways, out of curiosity…I’ve been using it in combination with the hydrating serum before bed only and I have to say that my dry, slightly flaking skin is now under control. I’m very pleasantly surprised especially because I also have acne prone skin but this combination has not caused any breakouts either! Definitely a major win in my books!"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,this is good,"it makes my skin feel really nice and also I love the  smell it kinda smells like mushrooms it’s really nice, I bought this because Hiram said it was good"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,really nice and light moisturiser ,"This is my first inkey list product and I am not disappointed, it is light and feels nice on the skin. there is an earthy smell to it but I prefer it to artificial fragrance "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,Horrible Packaging and Formula,"I couldn't give this product a chance even if I wanted to. For the price I was intrigued but the packaging is horrible. The formula is a water like consistency and the moment I took off the seal, the product just oozes out. It's such a waste! I immediately put the cap on and took it off and it oozed out more. At this point, am I even saving any money if it's going to waste? I would rather return it and splurge on another retinol alternative and get my money's worth."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,3rd repurchase and highly recommend!!!,"Here I am buying this for a third time!  It is a bargain for bakuchiol.  My skin is super sensitive, combo, acne prone, and loves this stuff.  It helps with brightening and fine lines.  I ran out and didn't reorder.  A month later I was regretting that decision and repurchasing.  I highly recommend, even though I also use tretinoin, that's so strong I can't use it every night.  I use this on off nights.  Yes the smell is a little unpleasant but I'm grateful there's no fragrance added.  The scent goes away very quickly.  Yes the packaging isn't good, but I transfer it to an empty inkey list q10 serum bottle and that's perfect for not wasting a drop."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,New Zealand,reasonably priced,"I did not see that much difference but it is definitely lighter, it has a good subtle smell, non sticky and hope it yields results when I use it for longer period."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,Favorite Active Product,This is one of the best products I've ever tried. Retinol is too irritating for my skin so I gave this a try and my skin is SO smooth and bright in the morning when I wake up that I can't use anything else. Truly one of the only products I actually feel and see a difference with. It works super well with the Omega Water Cream. Really hope these 2 products are here to stay.
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,Very Lightweight ,I love the effect that it leaves on my skin. it's a very lightweight moisturizer that deeply absorb to your skin and does not caused your skin to be oily. 
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Bakuchiol Moisturizer,"I bought this for my husband. He says “yea, it’s not bad,” which means he moderately likes it"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,Not too sure,"This is a replacement for retinol. There's a smell to the moisturizer which I can't describe, definitely not too my liking. I have yet to see results after using half of bottle."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Singapore,good product ,"I used this when i was pregnant and it work well . Didnt make my skin dry or peeling . For who with sensitive , pregnant or scared of retinol can try this first . Smell like herbal quite relaxing . Now i back to retinol so wont purchase again. Cheap and affective "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,Itchy red swollen rash,"Spot tested it on my arm and everything seemed fine....until I tried it on my face and neck. My entire neck became red, swollen, itchy, and hot to the touch. Not sure if I'm allergic to the bakuchiol or something else in this moisturizer. Trying a serum from another brand before ruling bakuchiol out entirely once my skin calms down"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,It's alright,Just an alright moisturizer for me.
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,Ms,Works well on my combination skin but can't use it on a daily basis. Using it once every 2-3days and have clearer skin after. 
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,nice and simple,"It’s a simple moisturiser.

I don’t know how well and high the bakuchiol is but it helps soothe and alleviate my dry skin.

Doesnt sting and fragrance free! So nice"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Singapore,quite good! ,"decent moisturiser! just be wary of the amount u put on your face as a combination of lots of different products really dried out and overwhelmed my skin!! but after using it over a period of time, my skin has come to like it! love the inkey list 
"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,easy to apply,Very light and easy to absorb to skin. I do feel it is not moisturizing enough when you’re sitting in aircond room all day or maybe during winter. Nevertheless it does its job
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Bakuchiol Moisturizer,"Despite trying multiple types, strengths, and tricks to tolerate retinols/trentinoin, my skin just wouldn’t tolerate it.  I decided to give bakuchiol a try. I just finished my first bottle of this and would definitely recommend for anyone that wants some anti-aging benefit but can’t tolerate the “good stuff”.  First, to those reviewing the packaging….you cannot beat the price point here so learn how to open it with the opening facing up. Yes, it is thin, but a little goes a long way and I found it to be more than worth the minimal cost.  No real fragrance and it didn’t irritate or bother my skin at ALL, which even the most benign of moisturizers will do.  I did use it as my primary nightly moisturizer but with heading into winter, will likely layer a heavier moisturizer or oil on top for more hydration.  I will be purchasing another bottle which is the best kind of endorsement there is!"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Super runny formula and the packaging was terrible. You don’t even have to squeeze the bottle for the moisturizer to come out and get everywhere.
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,New Zealand,Not what I expected ,This product smells like plants lol. It feels really nice every time I use it but I haven't noticed much difference to my skin. It's very small for a moisturizer but is a good product to start your journey to retinols. 
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Philippines,Best moisturizer for sensitive skin,"This is a great moisturizer. It doesn't feel heavy, doesn't feel sticky. I have sensitive skin so I cant put too many products on my face so this is perfect for me. I use this in the morning after washing my face with a gentle cleanser and then slap on some sunscreen and I'm done. And I love the smell too!  "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,My skin objects to this less than retinoids,"I want to use retinoids, but my skin goes crazy. No matter how I try to moisturize or what season it is (humidity), I just peel and flake and I can’t stop it. My face feels like it’s going to crack when I smile. It’s too obnoxious.

So I decided to try this as an alternative. So far it’s producing similar results, only a bit less so. I know this is a sign that it’s working, but ugh. 

People keep referring to this product as a moisturizer. If your skin is even slightly dry by nature, forget about that. I don’t notice any smell, and I always notice. I haven’t had any trouble with the packaging.

If you want to try bakuchiol, this is a pretty cheap way to do it. That’s the basis of my recommendation."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,talk to me when you've fixed your packaging,"product is alright but the seam on the bottle split after a week of having it in my makeup bag. saturated everything + the bag and ruined a couple of other products i had in there. how would i know how well it works if i lose 75% of it to terrible packaging? honestly don't think it's worth buying again to try. i know the brand is affordable, but i'd rather spend a dollar more to be able to use everything in the container/not ruin other products i've bought."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Bakuchiol Moisturizer,"Nice formula. I definitely had a bit of a purge once I started using this regularly overnight, and now my skin is finally clearing up and the texture improved. But I’m not sure if I would repurchase (I might try other products before returning to this), although the price is great. The smell is not the best, but not too bad either."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Bakuchiol Moisturizer,"Horrid. First off, the product is runny so it spills out of the tube. One on my face, it felt greasy and I immediately felt my pores becoming clogged. Needless to say I washed my face immediately to get the product off. I would rather go without a moisturizer then use this product! It is going back!!!"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Singapore,it’s okay ,It’s an okay moisturiser - it didn’t exactly make my skin feel any better or help to lessen my breakouts when I used it. Gave it away after awhile cause it didn’t seem to help much - thank goodness it was relatively cheap.
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,"Smells good, works well","It has a pleasant scent and gets absorbed into the skin very easily. 
Nice size and I appreciate it coming in a tube since I find it more hygienic although a bit difficult to get the most out of it. "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,Nice!!!,Really nice oil!! Works well under spf without feeling heavy.
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Singapore,Waiting for this to be back in stock to reorder,"A super lightweight moisturiser that feels refreshing on my skin. OK for oily-combo skin, I even use it under my Cerave PM moisturiser with ceramides and niacinamide. I think it helped with my fine lines a little. Maybe I'm crazy, but it might even have made my skin tighter and made face look more contoured? "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,I really like it for the price.,"I love this, very lightweight and hydrating. I have super dry skin and it is actually very hydrating."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,Not too bad,"Pretty basic, nothing too special, but was a nice moisturizer. I'm not sure if I would buy again just because there are other moisturizers for a similar price that I like more, but not a bad choice!"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,Amazing ,One of my best moisturizer ever🤩🤩🤩. I’m using it for almost three months now. I’ve sensitive skin sometimes using moisturizer can prevent little pimples but this one goes really cool with my skin
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,Love the smell,"I have been using this every night and I am loving it.  I used to use prescription strength Retin-A but it was giving me severe dry eye so I had to stop.  I wanted something I could just put on and get similar effects.  No fuss, I am some what lazy and just can't put 5 layers of etc etc on everyday.  I use this at night with my moisturizer over as I have mature dry skin.  The smell is perfectly fine and disappears within a minute or so, I actually like it.  This is the cheapest thing I own but have seen the most results from the Bakuchiol 1%.  Very happy with my purchase."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,I reacted-do a spot test!!,"Unfortunately I reacted to this product. I did a spot test but was too eager to try it to wait the full 24 hrs and kinda ignored what I thought look liked redness on my arm b/c I don't typically have sensitive skin. I applied all over my face, neck and chest and the next morning I was puffy, red and bumpy. I thought maybe it was because I used a 5% lactic acid too (which I've used already with no issues), but the spot test on my inner arm looked the same as my face. I don't like to give a bad review b/c I didn't actually get to try it-just want to advise people to do a spot test with this and any new product!"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,love it,"This is amazing....very gentle,lightweight and easily absorbed.Feel hydrated and moisture after using it.This product simple but powerful!!!will continue to purchase."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Singapore,Not enough Bakuchiol,"Bakuchiol is considered an alternative to retinol, however this product does have have enough of this ingredient to make a difference. "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,great feeling to the skin,"its my first time trying this and it feels so good on the skin, its not sticky and does not leave an oily feeling to the face, it takes a few seconds to feel like its fully absorb into the skin but it leaves skin feels great. Its just that When i received the parcel in its little box thought it was secured enough but it turns out it leaks out of the packet :'( so i have to transfer it to another bottle :( I hope next time they'll make sure it is well sealed before sending it to customers. Overall its great :) "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Singapore,Lightweight anti-ageing cream,"Bought this to introduce my skin to more anti-ageing skincare ingredients, and before I start on retinol. Very lightweight, comes with a slightly grassy scent, and doesn’t irritate my skin. However, it’s not as mosturising as I thought it would be on its own, so I have to apply the Rosehip Oil before this cream."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,love love love,"For someone with acne prone skin like me, i tried this one and what can i say is..this is the best moisturizer! it didn't cause breakout.my skin is improving day by day."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,bakuchiol moisturizer,"Price wise is Super worth and affordable, can buy it for everyday use, does what it does, moisturise your face ,no fragrance or smell found from it, overall experience is not bad considering is my first time trying it. "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,USA,Very detailed review :),"So I am 18 years old and I have oily skin. I have hormonal acne and due to working with a mask on, I have been getting cystic acne on my cheeks and around my jaw area. On top of that I have these white bumps on my cheek that I could never pop bc basically they have no head for me to pop it. Only my facial lady could pop it because she would use some extracting tools. I have never used a retinol bc I am 18 and am not responsible enough to wear spf daily also my skin is extremely sensitive due to me using a bunch of acids on it and ruining it for years. This product has REALLY helped get rid of the texture on my cheeks and it brought some pimples to a white head. I am very happy that it helped reduce the texture on my cheeks bc nothing would really help that besides professional extractions. SOME THINGS TO CONSIDER: I definitely used more than a pea size amount while using this on my face. If your skin is oily like mine this is a great treatment/light moisturizer but if your skin is dry this should be used a serum instead of a moisturizer because it is extremely lightweight. The product does have a weird smell to it but it did not bother me because I use it at night (I don't think its added fragrance). The bottle is very small so I do not think this will last long especially bc I do use more than a pea size amount to cover my entire face. Also i wish it came in a pump so you don't have to squeeze it out. Other than that this product really helped me and if you do not want to use a retinol I do think this can help you I just don't know if retinol would be a better option for some people or this but for me this works so I am going to stick to it. :)"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Malaysia,Simple but powerful moisturizer,Love the simple package. it come with great ingredient like bakuchiol. texture is super friendly to oily skin with affordable price. waiting for it to restock. 
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,Herby scent,"I feel like this doesn’t hydrate my skin very much. I have combo-oily skin and I still want something a bit more moisturising, particularly in winter. It also has a herby scent that I’m not a big fan of! "
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Australia,amazing!,"This moisturiser is perfect for my combination skin, it feels great putting it on and makes my skin feel so nice, the hydration lasts without feeling like I have a thick residue and I’ve noticed my skins improvement since adding to my regime! I can see why it’s always sold out as I’m definitely gonna become an avid buyer."
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Singapore,alternative retinol,"First inkey list product ever! So far so good!!! For the pricing point, I think it did a fairly good job. Besides that, I like how it’s small pack, make it convenient for travelling and staycay as well!"
THE INKEY LIST-Bakuchiol Moisturizer,Singapore,Mom's new favourite,"Bought it for my mum to use as a daily moisturiser and she loves it! It's not too oily for her and she claims it helps with her dark spots.
Will buy it again"
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Australia,good,Bought this for hubs to try after he started using and enjoying the lotus dream moisturiser. Count him a convert as he is currently onto his second tub with no complains. Hydrating and does not break him out. He has normal skin. 
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Singapore,good not great,"I want to love it but i dont see any improvement on my skin. I use the lotus night cream and love how it makes me feel but the morning cream doesnt feel that special or great. Would use alternative for cheaper price and same result. It absorb pretty well and sits well under make up. But that’s about it
"
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Singapore,Good moisturizer for dry skin,First time using this moisturizer. Pretty good moisturizer but a bit pricy though.
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,FRESH Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus - 50ml,Smells lovely and moisturizers well.  My dear friend gifted this to me and I really loved it on my skin.
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,New Zealand,nice and firm ,"I ordered this to try out since it noted it might be good for aging skin (I'm 40). I do like the product on my skin.  it absorbs easily and makes my skin feel light and plump, but I'm just not a fan of the smell. i ended up using half and then ordered another moisturizer... "
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,The Best!,This moisturizer works so great on my oily acne prone skin. I apply it day and night on a clean face and it never breaks me out. It smells really good like cucumber. It leaves my skin super soft and moisturized. It is a definite must have!!!
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,New Zealand,I love love love this! ,"This is such an incredible product for all skin types - especially my blemish prone and combination skin. 

I sometimes get dry patches along with breakouts and find that this moisturiser does an amazing job at giving the right level of hydration without irritating my skin. 

It has a mild cucumber scent which I actually like and it doesn’t irritate my skin. 

Such a generous size too and you only need a pea size amount. "
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Singapore,Good at what it does,Definitely moisturises your skin. However does not feel that it is worth it at this price point. May continue to use this until I find something as suitable. 
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Malaysia,Experimenting ,Have been trying a few new range product from Fresh since there is sales. This maybe the product that I feel is alright for the price point compare to the others like Rose. It’s give good moisturising effect but a bit sticky. 
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Australia,nice ,It just a moisturiser I didn’t know if it youth preserve my skin but it’s just like other moisturiser it’s hydrating other than that it doesn’t do more .
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,Very nice!,"So far so good! No breakouts, I have fairly finicky skin, so this has been a very pleasant surprise and i will continue to￼ Use this, the results have been good! I have only been using it for a week so I can’t say anything about the fine lines but my skin definitely looks more youthful and glowing.￼"

Fresh is always my no1 choice for skincare brand, this cream really do great on moisture my skin without any greasy and fast  absorb. Highly recommend . "
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Canada,A disappointing scent.,"I just can’t get passes the smell of this product. It smells like a vegetable, maybe a cucumber… for the price, I expected a more luxurious scent. Better products at that price point."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,Wish it had a different scent!,"I really like the way this feels on my face. Disappointing it’s not the cleanest product. Also don’t love the cucumber scent, but I’m pretty particular with scents. Prob won’t buy again, but a good backup."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Malaysia,breaks me out,I’m sad that I wake up with new pimples every time I use this moisturizer to sleep. It is water based so supposedly should be fine for my oily/combo acne prone skin but apparently it is not.. Another thing too— it’s fragranced. Deciding if I should try to finish the entire jar or just ditch it since it breaks me out really badly. I would not repurchase.
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,Time for my third jar of this precious nectar,Honestly I love this product! Ive emptied two jars and even took it on a long trip overseas where bag space was precious. It. Smells. Amazing. A little goes a long way :)
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,Love It!,I’ve been using this moisturizer for years now. I’ve tried others but always come back. I struggle with milia so I can only use very light moisturizers. It does not clog my pores and does not irritate my skin.
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Singapore,love it ,really love the fresh dream skin night cream so thought to try their day cream. its pretty nice but can get a bit heavy and I find that some of my makeup slips when applied over this. super moisturising but best for non makeup days 
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,New Zealand,Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,First time I tried this product and I'm loving it. Will definitely reorder this. 
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,My go-to,"This is what I use every single day. I bought the bigger bottle because I absolutely love it. It has a light cucumber scent, water like base, so it’s great for summer because it doesn’t feel heavy. The first time I used it, I grabbed too much product and left my skin feeling sticky - a little goes a long way. 
Change on my skin is noticeable, it’s brighter, tighter and I often get asked about my skin care routine. I also noticed my eyes look younger/tighter since I started using it, I don’t use eye cream."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Singapore,love it!,"have used it a few times, really love the product, great smell and moisturising. just a bit pricey"
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,Very calming,I have been using this for many months now and I love it. I have very reactive skin to most drug store products. This product is very calming for my skin.
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Australia,miss,Bought this for my mum it works very well for for her dry skin. Any fresh product I’ve used I’ve been impressed with it. It’s a little over priced but it’s worth it
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Singapore,Ms,"I like using this product, it makes my skin feels hydrated and has good smell. I could see improvements after using this cream. Will buy the big size next time. "
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,Pretty average.,"I wanted to love it as I thought I had done some pretty good research on what moisturizer I would use next. It’s simply nice and light, with a light sense. Does not moisturize enough and keeps me thirsting for more."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,pretty basic,Bought this with the night version when I ran out of my Estée Lauder stuff.  Had been using DayWear for 9 years and thought it was time to switch it up.  It’s okay.  Fragrance is strong for being “clean” and it also doesn’t have an SPF.  It absorbs well so I don’t mind topping it with sunscreen.  Will probably be seeking something new after I run out.
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Singapore,very moisturising ,"Bought this for my partner. He has very dry skin. This works really well for him, very moisturising. He loves the scent too. Great for day and night. "
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,Best moisturizer!,"I have been using this for years and absolutely love it! Occasionally when I travel I'll forget it and use another product and I'm always disappointed. Other products leave my skin feeling dull but this is hydrating without a strange sheen. Also the smell is mild/natural--like cucumbers, which I appreciate because I do not do well with strong fragrances."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,not for me,"I’m glad I bought this in a set to try it out, I used it for about 2 months I have acne prone skin and I was breaking out while using this moisturizer, I didn’t realized it contains HA my skin hates it. It was moisturizing. Its just hard to find a moisturizer with no HA in it."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,Best I’ve tried!,The only moisturizer I keep going back to. I’ve tried so many brands and this by far is the best!
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Malaysia,was a good purchase,"I can't tell if I'm putting too much on but it doesn't absorb completely and makes my face oily but also i tend to put a ton of product on at all times so could be a me problem
the smell is not disgusting 
my skin is not reacting badly to it so I don't think any of you would be allergic to anything in here unless your skin is super sensitive to new products which mine isn't 
not too bad of a product for its price :)"
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Canada,FRESH Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus - 50ml,"Wonderful! I do love it, absorbs very fast and great hydration but it’s def not worth the money. I’ll enjoy this jar but won’t purchase again"
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Canada,I’m in LOVE with this!!!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this as a sample with one of my purchases and OMG does this feel amazing on my skin. It smells like cucumber and is not irritating for my combination skin.

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,obsessed,I’m on my third or fourth jar. This is my absolute favorite moisturizer and I see a difference in my skin when I use it. I was without it for a few months and nothing else was the same! I also use the night cream and the soy cleanser. It’s all really gentle on my sensitive skin and feels amazing. It also last a really long time and you don’t need a lot of product. A little goes a long way. This jar will last me over 6 months.
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Taiwan,Ms.,"It's a very rich and moisture cream, I am oily combination skin so I can only use it as a night cream for air conditioning room. One thing I find isn't too pleasant is the smell of the cream, so this product is unluke FRESH rose collection that you will find relax and chill while applying the cream. I used it for a week already, and I found my skin is smooth and not too greasy when I woke up in the morning. Hope it will works its magic to help my skin from aging. "
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,not the best,"Not a good moisturizer to wear under makeup as it pills quite badly. It’s not bad at night but I’d prefer something thicker, so it doesn’t have a purpose for me really."

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Canada,FRESH Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus - 50ml,"I really wanted to love this moisturizer, but I had to return it because it made me break out. I have sensitive skin with a bit of rosacea, and unfortunately the fragrance was too strong for my skin. It smells amazing though, and it should probably be fine for other skin types that don’t get irritated easily."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,"Great product, a little pricey","This is a great moisturizer. It hydrates without feeling too heavy or sticky. Maybe not something I would pay for/re-order consistently because of the price but, a little definitely goes a long way so you don't have to re-order too often anyways."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Malaysia,Love this moisturiser ,"I really like this moisturiser. A little goes a long way, and the scent is very light. I have oily/combination skin, and this works quite well for me. I use this as a day moisturiser under my makeup."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Canada,lovely!,"I got this cream as a gift with the lotus night cream. I really enjoy the light sent and love how its not too thick for the summer. I tried using it in the winter, but it wasn’t hydrating enough so I kept it for the summer. Perfect summer daily moisturizer! A little pricey, however!"
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Australia,Great cooling gel moisturiser,"THis is a lovely moisturiser. It has a cooling feel to it on application and a gel like texture. Its great for summer, with the gel like cooling application but doesn't deliver enough hydration for winter. "
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,FRESH Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus - 50ml,"This is my holy grail moisturizer. I have tried several- a long and expensive process and this is the only thing I have come back to. When my skin starts feeling or looking textured, dull, and underwhelming I repurchase this. It’s fast absorbing, smells fine, and gives me the moisture to feel quenched all day with zero sign of oiliness. I also have dry skin and this is the only thing that I feel like makes me feel like my skin is back on track after one use."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Singapore,Good,Love this product as it is not scented and not too oily
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,FRESH Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus - 50ml,"I have used this for a few years now, I love it.  It is light, the fragrance is very light. I have sensitive skin that breaks out with heavier creams.  This one is perfect."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,FRESH Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus - 50ml,This is my holy grail! Been using it for about 7 years and I get so many compliments on my skin
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Malaysia,Not my first choice for a moisturiser,"When my skin disagrees with a product, it starts to have a little burning feeling. This product does not really burn my skin, but honestly I don't feel that much of a difference using this moisturiser than my other favs. It smells like a lotus pond (not in a good way) but it doesn't bother me that much. Overall, it's alright. Probably would not splurge to get the full size."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,FRESH Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus - 50ml,"This product was recommended by an employee. I’ve been having red, flaky patches around my mouth and nothing has helped. I started using this and the vitamin c nectar serum and it’s completely gone."

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,FRESH Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus - 15ml,"Was on vacation and forgot my moisturizer, sales person talked me in to trying this. My skin did not like it, broke out and little bumps all over my face. Would not recommend."

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,Summer all year glow,"I tried many others in a cheaper form but there is nothing like it.  I have bad flaky skin around my nose, chin, and between my brows.  This removes it and gives me a nice gliw with a light cucumber scent which is what I truly love."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Malaysia,fresh,made my skin so fresh n moist. i just use this on morning n share with my husband coz he like the smell n teksture

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Canada,So fresh!,"Love this moisturizer, especially during the spring/summer months. A little goes a long way, and it has a nice subtle fresh scent."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,Great smell!,Loved this moisturizer and used it as a night time cream. Great restorative / truly hydrated skin after a few applications.
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Singapore,Leaves the skin smooth after overnight use! ,Bought this product to try after using different Fresh product and this didn’t disappoint! Works well as a moisturiser - it isn’t oily and keeps the skin smooth and hydrated. Can’t tell if it’s youth-preserving tho 
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,Hands down the best I’ve used,"I’m in my mid-40s, live in Wisconsin in harsh weather, have combination, often very dry, sensitive skin, and have had rosacea for ten years. Several years ago I used the mini size of this product and couldn’t believe the change in my skin, but didn’t buy the full size because of the price. Fast forward to now and trying another mini to see if it was as good as I remembered. I’m sold. My skin had been so red, dry, bumpy, and irritated recently, and what a difference this has made. I’ve been reminded again why I loved this moisturizer so much the first time around. So much so that I’ve now purchased the full size. A tiny amount goes a long way, no need to slather it on. My face has never felt softer or more soothed and hydrated than when I use this product. My rosacea has even improved. I put it on every night before bed. The formula is lightweight, nourishing, and not greasy. No other moisturizer I’ve used has come close to helping my skin as much as this has. If you’re on the fence, at least give the mini a try."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Malaysia,Huge fan,"I discovered Fresh over a year ago. Am a huge fan now. My skin feels divine, nourished after application!"
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Malaysia,Best Moisturiser!,This is by far the best moisturiser I ever tried with this price range! Very good and I’ve been repurchased this Lotus day cream for many times. I’m using it with their Lotus night cream! Perfect match
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,Didn’t work for me & smells too strong,I tried a sample of youth preserve mask and loved it so ordered this item as well.  Major disappointment in a moisturizer.  It left my skin feeling clogged & greasy.  I wanted to wash my face all over again.  Most bothersome was the too strong cucumber scent.  Just awful.  Had to return.
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Malaysia,amazing,"It’s amazing. It’s hard to find perfect moisturiser for my skin. And i don’t know what my skin wants! I always buy small jar because it always feel fresh whenever i open new jar. And my skin really love this. My skin is dry, lil bit sensitive"
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,"great to quench dry skin, not for wrinkles at all.","Okay so let’s get real. I have very dry acne prone skin, and have hormonal acne as well. This product did not make a difference in my acne. It was no better or worse than it usually is. It lasted me 4 and a half months. I did not see a change in fine lines or wrinkles, I have 1 forehead line and crows feet and they look just as they did the day I bought the product. I’m giving it 4 stars because the scent is fantastic (it’s a cucumber & lemon scent) so it’s very fresh and very moisturizing. It really helped get me through the winter. However since it did nothing for my wrinkles I used it in my elbows and knees twice in that 4 months period. It’s great if you have extremely dry skin. Other than the purpose of moisturizing, it doesn’t work for the anti-aging claim. So I think they should sell it as a regular moisturizer…. It’s a bit pricey to not follow through with the claim."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,favorite!!,"Love this!! I used to use the rose moisturizer but then bought a cheap moisturizer when I ran out since it’s pretty expensive but it’s so worth the money, I will never change moisturizers again! This is pretty light and a little goes a long ways."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,Not for me,"At first I thought I enjoyed this but after a week of use, my face broke out completely and I’ve almost never had issues with break outs. I have combination skin that tends to be drier during winter so had hoped this would be perfect! High in fragrance and a bit oily. Will be returning."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,Definitely For Combination Skin,"Bought a trial size of this a few months back and it worked well so I bought the full size. I have combination skin (Caucasian) in my late forties and the formula doesn't cause acne but still provides moisture. I live in a subtropical state so I'm exposed to high humidity and daily exposure to sunlight. It's lightweight enough to blend well with makeup, sunscreen and any other serums I use without pilling or causing build-up. I use a little more than a pea sized amount on my face and neck. The lotion has a very light scent which is from the ingredients but after a few hours it disappears. It smells a little like their Soy Face Cleanser that I use. Since I'm not looking for anti-aging moisturizer this does what I need which is a moisturizer that doesn't cause acne. I would definitely recommend this for anyone with combination skin and to purchase the trial size to test it out."
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Australia,makes ur skin so smooth ,"I first received this product as a sample and was in awe once I tried it. I immediately bought myself the full size as I was so obsessed just by using it one time. It made my skin so smooth and it feels so much stronger. Would definitely recommend if you want to restore your skin!!

It has brought fullness to my skin that I was lacking and helps a little with wrinkles. The smell is light and fresh, I don’t feel like this is heavily perfumed. Not sure what these other users are smelling. I have used this for at least 4 months and I just love it in my routine. I can see a difference in my skin if I miss a day. I use this day and night but would really love to try the night cream soon."

I don’t understand why companies still do that
Nice consistency is about all I can say 
Nothing special"
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,Product Seal,"Is this supposed to come with a safety sticker on the side of the jar? I ordered the same size of the Lotus Youth Preserve eye cream and when I opened the box the jar had a safety sticker on the side but the moisturizer did not. I want to make sure I’m not getting a product that was previously opened/used. When I opened the jar, there was a large space or pocket where there wasn’t any cream and I could not tell of it was from an air bubble or actual missing product. Thank you."

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Australia,good,"I have dry skin, and this moisturizer is rich enough to keep my skin dewy without leaving a residue. Is a dream to layer under makeup, even with sunscreen and primer on top. Rich enough for winter but light enough for summer!

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Canada,second time buying this cream,I bought this last year and loved it during the winter months so I got myself another one for this winter. Light cream and non greasy. Kept my skin well moisturized.
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,Canada,Hydrating,"I have a moderately dry skin. My skin is not very sensitive so I am okay with most of the products.

FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,My favorite daytime moisturizer!,"I've been using Fresh Lotus Anti-aging Daily Moisturizer for years. Everytime when I tried to switch my moisturizer, I always came back to this one! As others described, it gets absorbed quickly into my skin and keeps my skin moisturized all day long when I am at work. It includes perfectly balanced amount of oil, which keeps my skin moisturized but not oily.  Plus, great but not too strong smell (mild cucumber/melon kind of fresh fragrance if you're wondering). Definitely recommending it for anyone with dry/normal skin!"
FRESH-Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer With Multi-Action Super Lotus,USA,worth the price,"Apart from the amazing smell, I love how hydrating this moisturizer is, it is well worth the price! I love it more than the tatcha moisturizers i have tried. I will keep repurchasing this moisturizer"
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Dark Spot Correcting Glycolic Night Cream,Australia,night cream,"I’m new to this brand but was searching for products to correct dark spots. My skin is very sensitive to perfume & products with alcohol. This cream feels very gentle & has a nice texture, it is rich without being greasy. A little goes a long way so the jar will last a while. I use it with the brightening essence which is also very nice!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Dark Spot Correcting Glycolic Night Cream,Australia,Loved it,This was magic in a jar for me. It worked wonders ony sensitive skin when everything else gave me a bad reaction. Love how it brightened my skin and didn’t even have to top up with a moisturiser. Sad that it stopped working on my skin after I finished my second but I continue to buy and use(currently on my 4th ).
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Dark Spot Correcting Glycolic Night Cream,Australia,great for dark spots but may dry your skin abit,This really works for my dark spots from acne scars and does not irritate my skin. However do note that it is a bit dry and you may have to use another moisturiser on top. The consistency is buttery and take some time to absorb.
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Dark Spot Correcting Glycolic Night Cream,Australia,Great for acne prone skin,"I got a sample of this and gave it to my husband, as glycolic makes me break out - he absolutely loves it for his acne prone skin. He's on his fourth tub of this. "
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Dark Spot Correcting Glycolic Night Cream,New Zealand,Doesn’t suit me! ,Found this night cream to not suit my skin. I have sensitive skin and am trying to discover new products to help settle my redness and spots. It was too greasy and didn’t really help with my redness overnight. 
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Dark Spot Correcting Glycolic Night Cream,Australia,Acne,Best night cream for dark spots and acne.. it’s makes acne dry and dark spots fade using it for past 3days can feel difference 
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Dark Spot Correcting Glycolic Night Cream,Australia,Hydrating night cream,"I was recommended this as a hydrating night cream for my very dry skin. It worked a treat when nothing else could keep my skin hydrated!

It is definitely a thicker cream, so if that’s a deal breaker, this is not the cream for you. "
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Dark Spot Correcting Glycolic Night Cream,Australia,Fav nighr cream!,"It's rich and I love it especially with Aus dry weather. Use it almost everynight, next day feel fresh and bright. Highly recommend to those who are dry skin and dark spot. Started to feel my dark spot lighter in some area after two weeks. Will continue to monitor"
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Dark Spot Correcting Glycolic Night Cream,Australia,not for me ,"This product was unfortunately not for me. It is really thick and takes ages to sink into the skin, I hate the feeling of moisturiser on my skin so waiting for it was not enjoyable. It also has a really strong fragrance that I don’t like. I hope that other people enjoy this product, but it’s worth noting if you have similar sensory related issues like me then maybe not the best option. Positives are that I would wake up feeling super smooth and looking brighter! I gave 4 because I think my issues are more personal and not to do with the product itself. "
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Dark Spot Correcting Glycolic Night Cream,Malaysia,Not absorbent to skin,Personally having combination skin. First time trying this product and using it as night cream. Not absorbent to skin at all. Left white cast when applying to face. 
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Dark Spot Correcting Glycolic Night Cream,Singapore,Does this work?,It claims to be a dark spot correcting cream but I don't see any difference to my hyperpigmentation. I've been using it at night for the last couple of months and have also paired it with the Caudalie Dark Spot Correcting Toner and their rose overnight recovery oil. I feel this is just a regular night cream that has been given a fancy name. 
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Dark Spot Correcting Glycolic Night Cream,Singapore,50ML Vinoperfect dark spot night cream,"Love all the caudalie products, so far this cream is really good on my skin and I can see my skin is getting brighter with the combine of vinoperfect serum together, the most important this cream doesn’t make my skin to breakout."
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Dark Spot Correcting Glycolic Night Cream,Singapore,Perfect Night Cream,"One of the best night cream which helps you to clear up your skin while you are sleeping. In addition, you will wake up to a better fairer healthy face in the morning… not too oily and good for acne skin. Tried the tester and now the real deal."
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Dark Spot Correcting Glycolic Night Cream,Malaysia,Excellent product ,Always the fans of Caudalie and I love the brightening series very much. The texture of the new improved mosturizer has become lighter and easier to absorb. 
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Singapore,good for dry skin,"It was a very thick and good my skin was soooooo smooth and glowy after applying it saw my hyperpigmentation fading away as well… 
Will definitely purchase it again and again "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Singapore,perfect for slugging,"i use it at night and wake up with moisturised, smooth skin. the texture is similar to facial oil so may not be suitable for oily skin but perfect for my dry skin."
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Singapore,must have for everything..?,I honestly dont know how to use this product and got it just because it was a hyped product. Apparently it can be used for the skin and hair and nails so i guess it’s an all-in-one product. Will test further!
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Singapore,I cannot live without this balm,I bought this balm just to try because I heard rave reviews about it.Once I’ve used it I immediately went to get another one.This balm is AMAZING.I use it every night on dry skin and it’s soft the next day.
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Singapore,I LOVE THIS CREAM,This cream genuinely make my hands so soft. I love this cream so much.It is a little expensive but a little goes long way.The only downside is that some may not like the smell.It depends if you like the smell of olive oil mixed with honey.
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Singapore,honey,I researched on it and it's pretty organic and I love honey products. I wonder why it's not under the Clean by Sephora category but it's good for dry sensitive eczema skin. it's best suited for my bedtime because of the humidity in Singapore. I have used this for years whenever my skin needs that glow and hydration.
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Singapore,Rich and Creamy,Super rich moisturiser and I use it whenever my feet gets too dry and slip over cotton socks overnight. This definitely will work well in colder climate or in winter time. Wish it comes in bottle form too. 
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Singapore,Many Uses,I like all the natural ingredients in this  product. I use it on my dry lips or psoriasis patches to avoid flaking and sometimes I warm up a little in between my fingers and tame my fly away hairs on my head or smoothen my hair from the humidity without leaving it oily. Also good under The Eye area at night and on dry heels.. product is  oily and thick and always need to warm up between fingers before use. 
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Singapore,Not to my liking ,Another highly raved product but it’s too oily and sticky at tropical countries like Singapore! It’d otherwise be awesome for winter days. I didnt apply on my face but rather upper and lower limbs but couldn’t finish the whole tub even till this day :S
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Singapore,okay..,its okay but its a bit sticky and heavy on your skin. so if you don't like that sticky feeling after applying  a moisturizer this one is not for you. though it does give you moisture so still ok I guess? 
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Singapore,Ms,The texture is not as emollient as normal moisturiser. It is more like a balm. Need to add a drop of Marula Oil or Rose Oil and if wanted to use as face moisturiser.  I use it as a cleansing balm to remove makeup.
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Malaysia,BEST SKIN MOISTURISER!,Love this product but Sephora Msia doesnt carry this one and cannot be purchased from Sephora online either. One of the best skin moisturisers I have ever used. Doesn't leave an oily / sticky residue. A little goes a long way too. 
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Singapore,best thing i have ever used for extra dry areas,"use this every single night before sleeping on areas like my feet, cuticles, elbows, knees and wake up with baby soft skin there.. already on my second jar and will continue to repurchase "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Singapore,dry skin saviour ,"love this is foot cream. use it at night, put socks on and wake up with baby-soft skin. also great to use on hands, especially massaged well on nails and cuticles "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Singapore,moisturising and nourishing ,"This is one of my holy grail! Whenever I have dry hands due to excessive washing or being in air-con room for long, I would use this. Skin would be less dry and moist with one application. Have been repeating purchase for this for years. "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Singapore,rich and it works,soothes itch fr eczema. very moisturizing (abit oily but that is needed for problem skin). only downside is the aroma. no fragrance but there is somewhat a smell. but is tolerable. 
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Singapore,oily ,I read about its great reviews and decided to give it a try. But it was a tad too oily and the feeling after application feels grimy and sticky. Not very comfortable. 
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,Singapore,Yew,"I would say it's a good balm for your lips, and elbows! But, definitely not an all-purpose balm like it claims. Product says that its a good makeup remover, but i had red bumps and itchy skin after just 1 use. A really pretty product to look at but, won't get it again. "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,psoriatic skin,works well as a moisturiser for psoriatic skin. kinda 'reduces' flaking from all over the body and it isnt steroid cream. Psoriasis sufferers would understand what im talking abt. good as base for body before applying coverups on psoriatic patches. pricey though
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Moisturizing!,Very moisturizing though a bit pricey but a little goes a long way. Heard some good reviews so I wanted to try it! I guess it would last you very long.
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,moisturizing,"it is a good lightweight emolient moisturizer. however for such a hefty pricepoint with very basic ingredients, you are better off getting aqueous cream from your local pharmacy "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,wow,"I read so many reviews about this product and had to try it. This is a multi-purpose product. Used sparingly, its a great moisturizer. It can be used as a face pack when your skin is specially dry. Lovely lip balm too"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,caused eczema flare up instead,"purchase at your own risk! I read rave reviews on how it could help sensitive / eczema prone skin types but I could not be more disappointed with this product. It’s probably too greasy for Singapore weather and my flare up was so bad I couldn’t sleep and needed to take allergy pills for the itch to subside. Will not encourage people to purchase, definitely not at this price point. "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Great for eczema,"I’ve purchased this a few times now for my brother and it has been great for his eczema. One jar can last about 2 months if used regularly. No scent, very hydrating. "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Egyptian Magic Cream,"A very versatile product which could be use almost to any part of my body. I always use this on my lips like a lip balm, sometimes use this as a lotion especially if the weather's so cold and my skin needs that intense hydration, and I sometimes put this at the tip of my hair to have that polished look. The product I bought did go a very long way. "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Good,"Seems like a good product for eczema on the skin. Not too oily, no strong smell and absorbs well. Will recommend to “sufferers” like us, you’d get what I mean!"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,a total no,"This product broke me out really badly. Used it in my face and body and had bad breakouts all Iver the day after. Not recommended for oily, acne prone skin. "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,pretty good,"multi purpose hydrator! I use a REALLY TINY bit (warmed up between my palms) as a night cream (when my skin needs an extra boost or when  travelling to dry climate), and as an under eye hydrator. then with the remaining to moisturise my my elbows and knees. a tiny bit really goes a long long long way. I have dehydrated oily sensitive skin btw."
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,mixed feelings,"it does the job to moisturise but it is too oily for me. does not have much chemicals which is good but it does not help much with my combination skin type
"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Great,"This is pretty much solidified oil with extra benefits, which is great for my dry skin, especially when I was on isotretinoin for a while! It's a thicker consistency so it doesn't slide around as much as an oil too. It smells weird though, my boyfriend doesn't like it, but I hardly notice it."
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,love it,Love this cream so much. I heard about it for long ago. Haven’t had a chance to get it. Found it at Sephora thanks Sephora I will repurchase it again and again. 
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,It’s okay,I only gave 4 stars because I didn’t like the smell of the product. But it is very moisturising when I tried it in my face and it works well with rashes.
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,can be use almost anything,Not a fan of this but it suitable to be worn as a lipbalm. Maybe if u have dry skin can be put as patch to dry skin. Otherwise i dont use this for many purpose
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Beautiful natural product ,"Natural ingredients, and super smooth application once you melt product in hands. Really enjoy using this, got the big version and works well on face and body without breaking out or congesting! "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,moisturised and hydrated !,"For the price , the quantity is reasonable. The effects of this cream changed my life. I never have a dry, taut face after washing my face and my skin stays dewy and radiant throughout the day. It helps with texture in a major way by smoothening my skin! I really do recommend this product. Bear in mind that this changes to oil , but not the typical thick oil. It is the perfect thickness for me as it isn’t so suffocatingly thick."
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,can't help falling in love,"I really like the texture of this product And it multipurpose use. , you can put it as lip balm, as a mosturizer as well, put it on the scalp,on the skin. I would like to order this again, I really love it "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,soso,very very oily. dislike the smell and the after feel when applied. don’t seem to have much effect on me. bought the bigger one as it was more worth and i regretted it 
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Satisfactory! ,Feels like a more luxurious version of Vaseline. I love slathering it on the body after showering. Makes the skin feel smooth and really plump and soft. I even use it on my son's dry patches on his face. A bit pricy though. 
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Not sure about this,"With all the rave reviews, I guess I was really excited about this product and had high expectations. I used it as a moisturizer for my face at night. Unfortunately, it didn't work as well for me as it did for others. There was no noticeable difference for me, no visible improvements on my skin. So I'm not sure what it did for me. But it was ok, did not break me out at least. Just not stoked about this buy and would not buy again."
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Magical cream,One of the best emollients! Melts on to the skin. Keep dry skin moisturised and at bay. Magical cream as stated! Would purchase it if price could be lowered. 
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,pls go for it ... it’s magical ,"Yes... as per its name, it’s magical. It works on my problem skin which is always dry and itchy. The beeswax like texture give a good protection on my skin. After apply it on my skin, I always spread the leftover on my palm to my towel dried  hair, and it left my hair moisture and shine. "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,not for everyone ,"Got some rashes from using this, maybe its not compatible with my skin. Waisted a whole bottle. I tried it at least once, got rashes every time. 
I am very sad with my purchase.

:("
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Egyptian magic,"Good product, hydrates skin and does wonders
Its not too oily and has no breakouts on my skin. I use it at night because it tends to get dry easily and my skins feels so soft and so moisturise the next day"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Great Moisturizer!,I love this product whenever I have really dry patches and lips as it moisturizes the skin really well. The only thing I don’t like about it is that it doesn’t really sink into the skin.
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Great for skin and nails,"i applied this on my blisters from wearing new shoes and the wound dried up within 2 days. Also applied to dry cuticles and nails on my fingers and worked wonders too! A little goes a long way, very happy with my purchase."
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Amazing,"This is an amazing product that you can use for EVERYTHING! I use it as a moisturizer and as a lip balm
                                                             "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,all purpose cream,Egyptian magic cream is a great basic multi purpose skin care product.Personally Ill keep using it.many usage.my children also love using this.wort it to buy
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Husband swears by this ,"I don’t use it cos I don’t like how shiny it makes me and it doesn’t absorb well
but my husband is onto his third tub and it’s the only one that gives him the moisture level he needs ?! "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,kinda heavy,Bought due to a raving review by gothamista. But...don’t exactly reach out for it due to its heavy/oily texture. Have yet to find other use for it except as a general purpose balm for insect bites and the like. Would suggest getting the small tub.
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,"Literally ""all-purpose""","This cream is soooo hydrating!! I use it as a hair mask, to treat cuts and burns (which heal within a night! WHAT?! Yes, I'm not kidding) and as a cellulite cream. It did help to fade some scars and cellulite! Loved it! However, it was a little too oily for my skin but it will be perfect the dry skinned peeps out there!"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Skin saver,"I have on and off acne and dry patches on my cheeks. This product moisturizes my cheeks and also heals the acne scars that I have. Also, this product can soothe burns, stings, works as a primer, AND never seems to finish? Winning product, in my books. "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Magic!,"Unlike your standard lotion that you can just scoop up and apply, you need to warm this in your hands before application.

I bought one big tub in April, shared it with my mum and we both ran out by end September. Loved it! "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Ms,Very thick and moisturizing cream. I use it overnight on any dry areas and I wake up the next day with really soft and smooth skin. Something I would definitely repurchase
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Good for rash cold winter,Only this helped when my face was cracking due to extreme cold weather while traveling. None of my creams worked. Was glad that I brought this along with me. 
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,very good buy,i love this product. i use it as a moisturiser and sometimes an anti-rash cream and it works its wonders. this small tub lasts really long i have barely touched the surface of the tub and i've been using it everyday. you only need to use a small amount
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Good hair moisturise,"I bleach my hair and it’s super dry! My hair is always very badly tangled, it’s hard to comb or even run my fingers through my hair! I use this as a hair moisturise before or after showering. It makes it easier for me to wash or comb my hair. Leaving my hair feeling smooth and moisturised!"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,A little goes a long way,"I have heard much good things about this product. I sometimes have rashes on my hands and applying this helps moisturise it and froms a protective moisture barrier. It is quite emollient, so a little goes a long way!"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Love it!,"the cream is best to wear over the night, wake up with your skin so soft & moist! wear it under your sock during the day time...no bad smell and protect your cracked heels"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,did not work as well for me ,I feel like this product did not really work well for me. I applied it daily and my skin was still dry. I bought it mainly because of the great reviews and unfortunately it did not work for me. 
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Improved my dry skin patches post pregnancy,I really thought my skin was hopeless after giving birth. My skin was so dry and patches were very evident. I am using this for a month now and the dry patches are slowly disappearing. My only problem is that it is difficult to scoop out the product from the tub in its solid form.
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Ancient Magic,"Life saver! Can be used in many ways, good to skin, heels and hands. Fragrant free and last long for years and years. Recommended to all skin type.. Can be used for skin allergy and any dermatology problems. "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Magical,"I use this balm mostly on my lips everynight and its super moisturizing, the next morning my lips feel plump and softer as I have occasional dry lips. I too apply a thin layer to my brows and lashes and I can see them getting longer progressively. Worth the money!"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,truly magic,"This cream is a staple in my    home ...me and my mum use this magic for literally all our need our hair  ( when the scalp or  the root and end of the hair gets too dried up) , we use it for our scars ( it really does help fade away scars) , face moisturiser, I use it to remove makeup ( it kinda pulls out every inch of makeup residue from your face and neck), I use for breakouts ( it’s really soothing and gets rid of my breakouts within days) , I use it for wounds, I could go on and on but I just can’t say how amazing a product this is (100 % natural) , I highly highly and again highly recommend and suggest anybody and everybody to have one this with you all time , it’s truly magic"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Okay okay,"It does moisturise but it just so sticky, just doesn't sink into your skin. It caused breakouts to me after sometimes. It does feels nice at first but it seems to lost the moho after a while."
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,like petroleum jelly,"It's just like petroleum jelly, but it has a looser, more watery texture-it's very spreadable and a little goes a long way. It has no fragrance. It's actually an all- around cream for the skin that's meant to remedy chafed skin, chapped lips, minor bruises, cuts, wounds, and any minor epidermal condition. It's just like a cheaper version of Lucas Papaw but with more natural ingredients. :)"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,the only jar for life,"I purchased this a while back, and after years, I barely even scratch the surface. Needless to say, this jar will last you a long time, as you only use a tiny bit. As for the product itself, this is the only moisturiser I use while I try to strengthen my skin barrier after years of abusing it with harsh chemicals. It provides enough moisture and hydration that I don't need anything else (my skin is oily combo). "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,oil,This product is just made up of solid oil . Does   nt any any nice scent to it just smell of Egypt I would say. A little goes a long way so I would definitely recommend buying the small tub instead. Very versatile product can be used anywhere on the body from the face to lips to any parts of the body. I like to use it as a lip gloss or lip balm. 
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,very good ,"This product can hydrate my skin very well especially suitable for cold weather and can use it for long time, not vey oily but absorb very well. Can you on many areas. I applied on my hair before shampoo and that make my hair very soft"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,It works but smells rlly bad,"bought this to try because of the number of good reviews but i have to say the smell rlly puts me off. but putting the smell aside, the “oil” rlly made my skin softer and smoother. 
Its alittle troublesome to use too as u need to “melt” the oil on ur hands before lathering on."
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,in love,I loveee this product <3. This is my second purchase. Decided to give it a try at first and loveeed the outcomes. I use this as a night moisturiser and i don't think my skin could ever live without this product. My skin feels super duper soft and smooth in the next morning. P/S: Best results when applying on a moist/damp skin right after face cleansings.
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,useful,"Cream is very useful as a all over body balm. It’s too thick to use as a face moisturizer in humid weather so I only use it in spots I have dry skin. If not use it as a lip balm, cuticle cream, hand cream, heel cream. "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,redundant,"Feels like petrolleum jelly. Dislike the texture, totally chucked it aside after 3 attempts at using it. Its like slathering vaseline gel all over your face, was not a smooth application and it just feels like a redundant product. Something i can live without and something i wished i had not spent on.  $53 for this, better invest in a more reputable brand."
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Not too bad,"Decided to give this product a try since its highly raved, and it did not disappoint! I use this cream more than i use my vaseline now. however, i do not find the smell pleasant.. but it does help in moisturising better than many products.  Thumbs up anyway! "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Worth the buy! ,"Excellent moisturizing effect I must say. It’s amazing how it works on both hair and skin. I use it routinely as a hair mask and it works wonders. My hair  feels smooth n soft after every use but care to be taken that it can stain u pillow a little if you intend to leave it on overnight. Great for my chapped lips and even my facia skin. Overall, a really good buy! "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,good,"This is good especially for my skin as i have very sensitive and dry skin, but is sometimes too oily so i apply it only at night and then afterwards in the morning i wake up to hydrated and happy skin!"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Totally like vaseline,"Bought it due to the raves. But so disappointed. It is so like vaseline. Imagine applying vaseline on your skin. Its solid form makes it hard to dig and apply, and it does not even sinked into the skin. Since it is expensive i just used it till finish. Definitely not repurchasing "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,good product,"i really like the egyptian magic cream. at first i was a bit skeptical about this product, but when i tried it it was really good. i never use it on my face, but i have tried to use it on my body and it’s a really moisturizing cream. it’s more like an oil texture, and it has a light smell"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,does wonders!,I absolutely love this product! i got confused because it says cream but its more a balm but I love how mild the scent is and i put this after my toner step and left it overnight and my skin was extra glowing the next day 
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Im still on the fence for this,"it's a bit too heavy for my face, and it kind of clogs my pores. so I am trying to use this in other parts of my body, such as legs which has dark spots. so far not much difference is seen. I tried using it for my heels too, which make them very soft. still discovering different uses for it. the tub is quite big and I can see it lasting a long time"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,love this moisturizer ,"waxy texture but when you use it, it kind of melts into an oil. not greasy looking and moisturizers very well. the moisturise lasts all day and a little amount goes a very long way and its a great deal! works well on dry skin !"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Extreme Moisture but not spreadable,"Although the cream is extremely moisturizing and easy to apply, it is sticky and hard to spread. Therefore, unlike what the packaging says, it is not suitable for all over body or face application. it is very useful to target dry patches and specific body parts like the elbow or heels of your foot. It is a great heavy duty moisturizer but not the kind which can be easily spread over a big area. need to use a bit of strength to get it out of the container too! But overall, no smell and really great of healing your elbows and any dry patches immediately!"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,magic,"its literally magic in a jar. works almost on any parts on your body. a bit oily if you use it too much, a little goes a long way. recommend for dry skin, as lipbalm, damage hair end, feet etc. i love it"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Best cream ever!,"Just tried this cream as i saw this from some celebrities and i could definitely say, its a must have! I always use this every day as a body cream and it really removes dryness and made my skin smooth. Also used this as a night cream to my face and when i wake up in the morning i find my face soft and smooth. I have recommended this to my friends and they are loving it as well. "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,moisturizing,"I’ve only used this for 2weeks since i left it at home when i had a vacation. It sure moisturise but im not into something greasy on my face since im oily but since i get good benefit from it when i wake up in the morning and wash my face, i can feel my face is soft and moisturized, i also notice that some of my dark spots were bit lighten than before i ever used this. i’ll just have to be patient with it. Since i got back, i’ll continue using it and see how it goes"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Satisfied,"This lasts forever.  I used it as a night cream and have nothing to complain. Been using it for years, and still have 1/3 of the jar.  Good usage when travelling to winter weather countries. For that price, and that quantity and that quality,  the product is worth every penny.  "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Best Cream Ever,"I can use this cream all over the body, from Head to Toe
And the result is PERFECTLY Smooth, Moist skin and hair 
from sun burn to spill oil just apply ""Egyptian Magic Cream""
and the most important thing is.... It's Chemical Free
"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,My go-to moisturizer,"My go-to moisturizer! For my face, body, and even for my long hair. It's already my fifth! So that alone explains the love I have for this product! The fact that it has natural ingredients makes me love it more."
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,gentle yet soothing,"I bought it for my one year old daughter who has pretty severe eczema since born. I only used it when she flares up, and it does calm the angry skin and helps soothe itchy and dry patches. It seems oily when you apply it, but it absorbs to the skin quickly. "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Great Product,"Many love for this product and i simply use it everywhere. I have eczema and this helps with my patches, works wonder with my chapped lips as well. Can be abit oily, Highly recommended for my dry skin friends. "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,the best all in one beauty product,"This is the best all in one product I have tried so far. I Will keep on ordering this product . So suitable to my sensitive skin , and  I use it as my hair balm, .  I Will definitely recommend this product to my Friends ."
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,great product,"Love this. My skin is super dry, so when I applied this after water-base body lotion before bedtime, I sealed the moisture with an Egyptian magic and it works great. My skin is feels soft the next morning :) 
"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Good to have,I have combination oily skin. I first used it as a sleeping mask but it caused a few pimples. Hence I applied it as a hydrating mask instead and wash it off after 30 minutes. I realised with regular use it works well in reducing my acne scarring and reducing my forehead wrinkles. I have also used it on my cuticles after I remove my manicure extensions and it helped tremendously in making my cuticles healthy again. I have also used it as a hair mask and my hair did become smoother afterwards. Overall it's a multi purpose cream that is good to have!
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Ms,"I was desperate and bought this as a hair treatment/mask for my frizzy hair ends. Despite its multi-purpose claims, its just way too oily for hair ! Took me few rounds of shampoo to wash out the grease. It serves better as a moisturiser for dry skin. I will not buy this again. "
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,It was okay,It was too oily for my liking and it does sometimes causes breakouts. The results is not really obvious although it does hydrates your skin overnight. Definitely can't use durng daytime due to the oilyness.
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,great for dry skin!,"i works really well on my dry skin and im on my 3rd jar...!!! 
it absorbs faster too, can also use it as a lip balm to avoid chappy and to keep my lippie moisturized, some say its quite similar to petroleum jelly but i think its way more than that! it's an all purpose cream to try for!😁
"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,no works...,"l dunt know why, first applied, second applied, third appiled have no result in my skin....l dunt know what was went wrong eaither my skin or this product egyptian magic cream, no works no result no effect for my skin..."
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,HOLY GRAIL,"I’ve used this for years, stumbled across it when I was looking at products that help reduce the appearance of acne scars. Not only did it clear up my skin, it keeps my skin moisturised and feeling amazing. Also great for eye make-up removal and for your hair. I will never stop using this!"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Even Madonna recommend it too!!,"Good for multipurpose use. Whole body will 
love it!! Elbow, pimples, scars, rough area.. just name it!! Google it for more info! This is my second tub! Will use it forever. No complaints! Non greasy! Give it a try
"
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,good,Good purchase ! I used it for my hair and face! Love the product and works very well !recommend to everyone! Its a multipurpose product and I love it very much ! Although it’s a bit expensive but worth every penny 
EGYPTIAN MAGIC-Egyptian Magic Cream,,Egyptian magic,"Way too overhyped, too greasy to use as a daytime moisturiser. So I've only ever used it at night. Makes my skin itch and doesn't help my dry skin at all! However, gentle enough to put on my eyelid so that's the one plus point. Overall extreme waste of money, drugstore moisturisers are much more worth it and they actually do the job -_-"

I really recommend this!it’s not just only night cream also can be your sleep mask and you don’t have to worry forget wash your face before you slept…
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Malaysia,Pleasant scent,"It has a pleasant lavender scent and yogurt-like texture so the consistency is a bit thick but once it’s slathered well on you face, it doesn’t feel that thick. I have a dull and sallow skin so this is a perfect night cream for me to restore the tiredness on my face. Although I haven’t seen any significant results yet but my experience with this product is great. I look forward to applying this cream every night 💜"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,Works well.,It is very small but i decided to buy this small version to see if it works. Happy with it. May buy the larger one when i ve used up this smaller one.

IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Australia,Not so impressive!,"I have bought this thinking it’ll restore my skin, I didnt notice any changes after 2-3 weeks of using it.
Im not fully satisfied with this product and i dont think i would order it again."

IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,Purple and passable,"It leaves the skin bouncy and not greasy, but the scent is a bit much. For the price, there are far better products. Don't waste your time with this one"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Canada,Not worth the price,It feels nice upon application but I’m not a fan of the scent and the texture is not as nice as the Confidence in a Cream. It piles if I run my fingers across my forehead. Will not repurchase.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Australia,10/10.,"Took me a few weeks to realise this was incredible. The progress your skin makes with this is very slow, so it’s hard to notice. Overtime your skin just feels rejuvenated, plumped up fresh, smooth but not oily, & glowy! It’s more of a jelly/cream hybrid (which you actually grow to love), but easy to apply if rubbed on fingers, pressed around the skin, then massaged in. The cream flattens out in the packaging, so you’re able to use all of the product. This night cream is worth every single cent, it works. Get ready for glowy & rejuvenated."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,Surprisingly hydrating,I just bought this to try it out. And I’m so glad they had a mini for me to buy. Well I was not disappointed. I have combination skin and of course some dry patches. My sensitive skin loves it! My face felt hydrated & soft.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,Skin Saver,"It works well for my dry skin. Its easy to apply for a lazy person like me. Even though its quite pricey, its worth the buy! Will definitely buy it again!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,Good 👍🏻,This is definitely also a good night moisturizer. I ordered & tried this because the Confidence in the cream is out of stock. I prefer the latter as it has no scent & creamier. 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,New Zealand,LOVE THIS,could not recommend more i love this cream! makes my skin feel sooo soft and looks good when i wake up to create an easy base to go from the next day! love it! definitely recommend if you’re wanting something super hydrating to leave your skin feeling smooth and soft.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Malaysia,Rave done right ,"I have dehydrated skin and as soon as I pun on any skincare it dries up, too much oil I wake up with bumpy skin, so I was in need of something for my night use. I’m not sure if this really is mom transferable on pillows but I do love it’s thick-marshmallow like texture. The scent is on the stronger side but I love lavendar so I don’t mind it. This does not feel too thick and rich on the skin I pleasantly like how it feels. Will repurchase. 
"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Australia,It’s ok,I usually use the ‘IT confidence in an eye cream’ which is half the price of this product and I see no difference between the two. I think I’ll stick to the cheaper option. 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Australia,Beautiful night cream,"I LOVE the IT Cosmetics beauty sleep cream. It’s thick and nourishing, especially coming into the cooler weather. I will 100% purchase this one again. It does have a strong lavender scent, which I love, but something to be mindful of if it’s not your jam. "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,My staple night cream.,"I love this, and I love how it makes my skin feel both when I apply it at night and when I wake up. It’s not greasy, smells great and replenishes the skin after a long day."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,Not as good as Confidence in a Cream,"I am a fan of Confidence in a Cream, and expected this to be at least as moisturizing as that one. Unfortunately, I wake up with dry skin. It does not have the same thick, luxurious texture as the Confidence in a Cream. I like the lavender smell, but otherwise it is nothing special."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,so so ,Couldn’t see any effect after I woke up .. same me. Lucky I bought the smaller size to try out first if not the whole jar gonna be wasted. Will not re purchase it again. 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,feels good on skin ,Feels good in the skin upon application. Love the pillowy texture. But too rich for my combination skin. Had a bit of breakouts on my forehead but small ones. 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Malaysia,xoxo-lots of love,I was buying this to pair it with the day cream.. at first I don't really like how it feels on my skin. its too sticky/creamy. But when I woke up my skin is glowing and brighter!! will keep coming for this one!! 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,Pillow Cream,"one of my latest purchase which is so great, still using. hope to see v shape face with constant use. smell is good & cream not sticky. brought 3 in a go after trying the sample."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream - 60ml,"The best sleeping cream I’ve tried, leaves my skin soft and fresh."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Malaysia,Sleeping Beauty.,I started using this cream when i get the free sample. The thing that i love buying IT cosmetics is i always get free sample for their other range products. This cream makes my skin feel moist every morning. Loving it!
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,not for me,"Face still very oily in the morning (dry,sensitive skin), some redness after washing off. Not sure about the effect as I only use once, won’t be using again as i don’t like the greasy feeling n the smell. "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Malaysia,best cream,"One of the best moisturizer i have used. Keeps my skin hydrated the whole night. Usually skin gets mildly dry due to the aircond but with this, it does not"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,.,"Good for the price, will purchase bigger size. Smell gooooddddddddd..............................,........................................................"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Canada,IT Cosmetics Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream - 60ml,I love this cream so much. I started with a sample & purchased the full size as soon as I ran out. The scent is so relaxing & perfect for bedtime plus it makes your skin so super soft.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,overwhelming scent ruins it,"This product actually works well to moisturize and smooth my skin.  HOWEVER, the scent?!  It’s so strong that it makes my eyes water for an hour after application.  It’s not a bad scent and I usually don’t mind added fragrance but this one sooo strong that my eyes can’t even handle it.  This makes it unusable for me. I’m so sad because it really was a nice nighttime cream.  Remove the overwhelming scent and it’s a perfect product. Why would they ruin such a good thing with an unnecessary fragrance?"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream - 60ml,This is one of the best moisturizer! Works so well for me. Definitely need another
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,Gets The Job Done,"Good product with a nice smell, which is relaxing especially at night. Not a big noticeable difference in skin quality but it was decent with a light finish."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Canada,Not the fragrance,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I tried once and will never put it on again, the fragrance is way too overpowering. The texture reminds me of Tatcha night cream and the formulation is okay. Without the fragrance I may love this product."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Malaysia,Best!,"One of the best night creams I’ve ever tried, if not the best. So smooth, hydrating, moisturizing, silky. Easy application, glides into the skin like butter. Contains oils, but never brings me pimples, as other products with oils do. Instead, you get the softest skin ever and rested face in the morning. Get it now!!!"

IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,Amazingly Soft,Amazingly soft! My face feels so soft when I wake up in the morning and goes on so smooth. Highly recommend!
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,The smell!!!,"In all honesty…I would continue to purchase this just because of the smell LOL overall it’s a good product but the smell just sells me on it! I do feel like my skin is pretty hydrated in the morning, so it definitely gets the job done. I love applying this when I feel I need to wind down and relax. It feels so nice when applying to the skin but the experience is taken to a whole new level with the lavender scent."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream - 60ml,"I’ve tried a lot of skin care products & very few of them really impress me. I haven’t found many where I can actually see a difference but this product is amazing. I got the mini size to try and am already purchasing the full size. I have combination skin, dry on my nose and mouth and oily all over everywhere else. Hydration has been key for me keeping hydrated skin overall & using this at night has done that. I also love the slight lavender smell, it’s not overpowering but just enough to be relaxing."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Australia,BURNS!! 🔥 ,"I am the biggest IT Cosmetics fan! I have been using their products for years. I'm obsessed with Confidence in a cream and have been using it for the past 5+ years! this night cream is not the same luxurious quality. it's way thinner in consistency and burns my face. I don't have sensitive skin at all but every time I have tried it, it burns. keep away from your under eyes. it will sting and get all puffy! so disappointed in this cream. I had really high hopes and really wanted to love this. Stick to Confidence in a cream, it's cheaper too somehow..."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,I found my perfect night cream.,"I've only been using it for several days, but have already noticed a difference. My complexion is clear and my skin is so smooth. It got rid of the tiny red bumps I had on my chin already! My skin is so hydrated and stays hydrated even into the next day. I LOVE how it feels when applying. I have sensitive skin but this does not irritate at all. In fact, it feels so soothing and invigorating to my skin it's a pleasure to apply. It has a slight medicated smell which is pleasant really. It also absorbs nicely. I've tried several brands and I've liked a couple of them fine, but this is the one I want on my vanity for life!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Malaysia,Hero of the night!,It first came as a tester free gift when my mum bought their cc cream. Took the tester with me while staycation and boomm my skins looks so plump on the next day like it was drinking water for the entire night. Came back for the small size for nights when I need booster skin the next day!
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,New Zealand,sleep face cream ,Leaves my face soft…i use this after i cleanse my face and it so soft and makes my face feel smooth.. i use very little product. This was recommended to me by a friend and totally love this product…
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Canada,IT Cosmetics Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream - 60ml,I love IT cosmetics products. This night cream is hydrating and keeps my skin dewy. I have oily skin and it works so well for me. Just love it!
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,Aromatic ,One of the latest product from IT . Has a lingering lavender scent which I liked. A very pleasant lilac coloured pudding like texture and is very easy to apply.  I woke up the next day feeling invigorated. Good to use it on the plane especially during  red eye flight. 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,quite good,"tried a sample of this before and i quite like it. didn't breakout, my skin did feel softer and clearer in the morning, hence decided to purchase the full size."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,Nice,I bought this for a friend as gift. Great packaging and affordable price. Will definitely purchase again for myself to try or get this a gift again for friends.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,Not bad,"Not bad for this price, skin is smoother when I wake up next day. I use it twice a week, doesn't cause outbreak. Hydrating. Recommended. Will repurchase."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,great night cream,My absolute favorite night cream. I’ve used it for a few years and only ever stopped because there were so many new products that I wanted to try... well I’m back. Can’t be beat. It makes my skin so plump and soft by morning. I notice a huge difference using this. I finally bought it again and I woke up this morning and kept touching my face and I can’t believe I ever stopped using this! So good. It even feels luxurious putting it on. A little goes a long way too.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,Good Product ,"Very Good product I Love it so much, especially age above 50, I feel young forever. Keep such a Good quality. Wrinkle also a little better and better."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Canada,wanted to love it but caused pilling,"I wanted to love this so much that I tried it multiple times over the past few weeks, but unfortunately it creates too much pilling after 15 mins of letting it sit. I always have to end up re-rinsing my face and using my other products instead. Nice lavender scent, although a bit strong. Didn’t have it on long enough to notice any breaking out or negative effects, but also didn’t notice any positive effects either. Unfortunate :("
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Malaysia,Nice!,At first I was not confident in it that’s why I got the small tub. But it felt so good! I love the jelly texture it’s like a pudding and the purple colour is so beautiful! Most importantly I don’t feel greasy after using it and it is absorbed fast into my skin. Nice cream! 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream - 60ml,"I had previously used the IT cosmetics “confidence in a cream” and loved it. Wanted to try this out.

Absolutely do not get!
I noticed the first few times I applied that my skin was burning and tingling a bit but attributed it to a new RX cream I was using.
But then realized it only happened when I applied this night cream on top.
I just used again and my skin was burning so bad I had to wash my face twice! The pain was worse than a chemical peel.

I didn’t have any aversions to the consistency, and the scent wasn’t *too* much for me personally, but it is more overwhelming than you would want or typically find for your face cream.

Stick with the OG confidence in a cream or search elsewhere!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,Great product!,One of my favorite night creams. I like the smell and texture and most importantly I saw a huge improvement on my skin.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Canada,Great for super dry skin!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Love this product!! I have extremely dry skin and live in a very dry climate. So when winter hits my skin is in rough shape. I find this night cream has been rescuing my skin!
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Malaysia,md,Hydrates skin. Love the smell. Bought a small bottle to try. Will be getting another once it finishes. Makes your skin feel hydrated during the night. Great product. 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Malaysia,so-so,"Bought this in small pack to test out, since I already like the Confidence in a Cream, which is really the right consistency for me. I have dry, parched skin, prone to sensitivity. Lavender smelled ok, unfortunately as I suspected, this was not good for my skin. It did not have any extra benefit and made my skin itch. Will stick to their regular cream"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,My Holy Grail Night Cream!,"No matter how many night creams I try, I keep coming back to this one. My skin feels its smoothest and softest and looks its glossiest and clear when I use this cream. The texture is more of a jelly-cream hybrid, so it has high spreadability and doesn’t leave an oily residue behind that will transfer to your pillow while somehow still feeling super creamy and supple on the skin."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,Wonderful!,This night cream makes my skin so happy! It smells amazing and feels delightful on my skin. It melts into my skin and I wake up feeling hydrated. My skin is bouncy and lush in the morning.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,"Beautiful creme, fragrance unnecessary.","Makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. I like the gel hybrid texture as it is sufficient enough to keep skin moisturized all night, while absorbing nicely into the skin. I have had oiliness most of my life but now that I am a little older, my skin needs more, and this cream does the trick. Giving 4 stars because even though the fragrance is not a deal-breaker for me, it's unnecessary."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream - 60ml,I could see amazing results from the few uses I got out of the sample. I love it!
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Canada,Great cream,Love this product.. goes on smoothly and gives my skin a nice glow in the morning.. My skin can be sensitive at times but this agrees with my skin.. no issues.. the scent I believe is lavender.. I don’t find it off putting it’s a great product but maybe not for everyone..a little also goes along way
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,Great for Oily/Acne Skin,"Really like this night cream, and it's around the same price of my other favorite one, Korres Wild Rose. It's very moisturizing but didn't cause any acne. I'm 47, with oily/hormonal acne prone skin. I didn't put this on my chin, which is very sensitive, and I love the feel of this cream on my skin. Would highly recommend. It's pricey, but you can always shop sales or get lucky at TJ Maxx occasionally. A little goes a long way with creams. I've been using this for a few weeks now, along with a lot of other pricey items, and my face is really at its best. I can't give this cream all the credit, since I really am using a lot of items. However, I feel like this played a part in the health of my skin at the moment. As for scent, it's very mild."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,highly recommend,"I got a sample of this cream and it made my skin feel so so soft and supple. It also felt relaxing and made me feel ready for bed. I swear I always felt like I was ready to sleep, the scent made it extra BOMB."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream - 60ml,"Love love love this cream ! I have very sensitive skin most anti aging products break me out ! Not this! I love the smell it reminds me of when I’m getting a facial. I’m 28 so I don’t really have wrinkles, more so protecting and preventing. I notice my expression lines look smoother, my skin overall looks baby smooth, glowy and healthier better than when I was in my early 20s."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,"Cool, scented, relaxing.",Got a freebie of this product and had to have the full version. I don't know about the transformative character but this feels AMAZING on your skin and the lavender scent helps me get to sleep. May not be for you if you don't like strongly scented product but personally I can't get enough.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,It’s A No From Me,"I very rarely give one star reviews but this is horrible. I’ve been trying to like it for months and every time it burns my skin and leaves it just as dry. Last night, I had patches of dry skin and reached for this product to alleviate. BIG MISTAKE. Not only did it make my entire face red and irritating, but it worsened the dry areas and small bumps appeared as a reaction. I had to immediately wash my face because the pain and burning were too much. I really tried to love this product as I believe it cosmetics has great products, but this one is a no from me. The second picture I attached is after I cleansed my skin and reached for another product to calm the reaction. As you can see, it was still very much inflamed."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,Perfect night cream,"This night cream makes my skin feel amazing! I know some are bothered by the smell, but I love it! It is a unique texture, but provides baby softness."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,Thumbs Up!!,"A little goes a long way!  I like the moisturizing properties in this product, and it's really enhanced the robustness of my skin."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,"sample was lovely, price is not",Received the sample and tried it 2 nights in a row and I have had no problems with it. My skin looks so moisturized and nice. I want to buy it but I can’t justify the price at the moment. I have combo skin with a very oily t zone and medium tan skin color and didn’t notice any irritation from this. It is a purpley color and has a fragrance smell but that did not bother me or irritate my skin.  Going to find a comparable product in a better price range but again I liked this.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,Moisturizing Night Cream,"This is a lovely moisturizing night cream.  It feels rich, and feels like it's doing its job while you sleep!  And even though it's super hydrating, it doesn't break you out.  A little bit goes a long way!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Canada,IT Cosmetics Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream - 60ml,"I can say it firms your skin and has acceptable effects on wrinkles, but it broke out my skin. I use IT moisturizer and eye cream, which are great, but definitely I will not buy this one again."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Canada,So fabulous,Amazing product! Smells of lavender and is so relaxing with a great texture that absorbs well. My skin feels hydrated and plump even in the morning. I'm 45+ and was looking for something effective that didn't feel too heavy and rich - this is the one! It has an almost gloopy texture which is always feels cool and fabulous when I apply it!
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream - 60ml,I love this product! It smells great! I’ve recommended it to numerous people since using it.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream - 60ml,My favorite night cream. Is super hydrating but doesn’t make me feel like my face is still wet when I go to bed
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,USA,love this!,I love this night cream!!! I have noticed a huge difference in the integrity of my skin. I have an acne prone/oily skin type and I feel like it doesn’t make my face feel oily at all. I would definitely recommend!

IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,burns your face,real shame as I love it cosmetics but this burns my face makes it very painful and red it has a very strong fragrance also which may be the source of the irritation. I would like a refund for this product.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Malaysia,love it! ,"Totally become one of my favorite face cream! Loving the result! So good. I can see great improvement on my skin texture, non drying. Super recommended! "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Philippines,Worked wonders,"Great night moisturizer! My skin felt so smooth the day after. It just has a citronella smell, which makes it seem as if you are putting on bug spray on your face, but that's not really a big deal for me since it does deliver! "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,best night moisturiser ,Love the feeling after applying this cream. Skin feels tight and absorbs completely into the skin without having any greasy feeling. Love the smell and the glow on the face the next day morning 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,Lovely,2nd time purchased. I feel very fresh after put it on my face night time. And morning I feel the same way too. Definitely I will buy again after finish my current using one.

IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Malaysia,L.O.V.E,Im on my second full size jar. I wake up supple every day. No irritation even the consistency is very thick. Definitely repurchased. It would be perfect if the price is slightly cheaper..
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Australia,Itchy Skin,Used this cream for 3 nights and was initially very impressed with the feel of my skin afterwards. However on the 4th night after an hour my face started stinging and I woke up the next day with itchy white lumps all over my face which are only starting to subside 3 days later. Beware if you have sensitive skin.

This stuff smells amazing and leaves my skin feeling super moisturized and plump. My skin always looks so refreshed when I wake up. Will continue to buy this over and over again!
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Philippines,great cream,"really great for dry skin, but its not oily just good and creamy for my dull and dry skin. I will but the bigger size once mine runs out. totally recommend this!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In Your Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,loving IT products,"I am new to this product and Wanted to give it a try as there was a 20% discount. Though is a cream based product, it does not give a oily feel after application. The fragrance is rather mild which is acceptable. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Singapore,brightening gel,"ok… i gave this to my boyfriend and he likes it! He says his face is smooth like a baby butt (so extra but that’s him) Really brightening up your skin! He’s been using it everyday now. Mind you, his skincare rountine is only water.. Now???? add this. Thanks! "
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Australia,Below the expectations ,This creme didn’t do what it promised for me. It definitely moisturise but didn’t brighten the skin. I would prefer Ole’s  peptide moisturiser over this one.
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Australia,Awesome Moisturiser ,"Don't know about the brightning as it will be too early to judge but it works better than most moisturisers in moisturising the skin. Also the formula is non sticky, non greasy. It absorbs pretty well and gives an instant glow."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Australia,Absolutely Incredible,"I have gone through so many moisturisers, but this is one of the first I've ever come back for, going to buy my 3rd one soon. This cream smells amazing, the cream itself sinks into your skin so well, with no oily looking residue but instead a dewy finish. And I'm not even exaggerating. I've noticed that this cream gives my skin that bouncy dewy feeling for around 3-4 hours and after that it is just comfortable hydrated. I think by the roughly 12 hour mark my skin starts to get a bit dry. So all in all, I'd definitely recommend getting this!!!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Australia,Great for brightening and effective ,I have been using for 2 years and its really effective. I can totally see brightness on my face. 100% recommendations for Indian skin especially. Totally worth it. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,New Zealand,best moisture ,"Better for brightening only 
One of my favourite products from Sephora 
The olehenriksen cleanser and this moisture combo is amazing. This moisture is worth for this price. Keep the skin look fresh for the whole day. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Australia,Amazing ,Bought the sample pack for my mum but it did wonders for her skin that she came back for the full size product!!! Couldn’t recommend this brand enough. Perfect for everyone 
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,Using for last month . I haven’t see any improvements.
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Loveeee,Loveeee This Moisturizer I have Dry/Combination and Definetly Acne Prone Skin. Feels sooo nice after I cleanse my face Have Definitely Noticed a Difference in my Skin. I Apply this after a serum or by itself and I Feel Moisturized and Nourished!
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Like it,"I really like this product and the fact that it has Vitamin C in it. The only problem about it is that it crumbles up after a few hours and comes off the skin in chunks. So, I just wash it off and re-apply. Other than that- great product!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Truly brightens skin and acne scars,"This product has been a staple in my life for about 5 years. This helps with my acne scars, and makes my skin plump."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Australia,way too good ,I use this every night and I’m now on my second jar it makes me look more awake and doesn’t make me break out! It’s so good! Definitely my holy grail

The skin benefits are also great. I highly recommend this and would consider getting another bottle of it!
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Love this product,"Love love love this moisturiser. This is a hands down product for me. It gives me a smooth, brighter skin and gives me a nice glow. This works best under the foundation and gives you a glowy and shining skin."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,Don’t like the particular smell… my skin is very dry.. not enough moisturizing for my skin.. so I returned it
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,New Zealand,C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,"Feels nice on the skin and I think it has helped with brightening my complexion (paired with a vit-c serum). With my oily skin, I’ve taken to using this as my nightly moisturizer because I find it gives me that dreaded shine during the day otherwise. The orangey scent was not quite what I was expecting but it’s not a deal breaker either. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,New Zealand,"Nice Moistersor, but pricey",This is a really nice smelling moisterisor and does give the skin a really nice base for makeup. I just find it a bit pricey and my drier skin needs a bit more hydration than this provides
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,New Zealand,Keeps it glowing!!,Great vitamin c moisturiser with hydrating properties. Keeps the skin glowy and plump. It’s for those days and nights when skin looks tired and dull. Will be purchasing again.
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,"loved this moisturizer. feels great, feels moisturized all day, refreshing, didn’t cause oiliness as some gels do for me. absorbs well. i used this alongside vitamin c serum so i’m not sure if this brightened the skin as it claimed to since i do already use vitamin c. four stars because it does pill the first hour of wear if you touch it, so i would have to wait to apply my makeup to avoid issues there. as someone who doesn’t wear makeup daily this wasn’t a big deal to me and i had the extra time on weekends to wait for it to pass before doing my makeup. i won’t be repurchasing right now, but may in the future"
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,New Zealand,amazing find ,"I have found my everyday, any season moisturizer. it's not too sticky, absorbs in the skin and it leaves a fresh and dewy finish. I have been using this for the past three years. Also is an amazing base before applying make up. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Favorite moisturizer,"My favorite moisturizer so far: it smells great, moisturizes and softens skin, and makes the appearance brighter. Also, it never caused any breakouts, neither made my skin oily/sticky."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Malaysia,C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Was highly recommended to me by my SA. And I got to say I love it. It absorbs easily and doesn't cause any stickiness. Definitely gonna buy it again.
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Australia,Fatima,"I have been buying this product on repeat!! It never disappoints me to use this whether it’s summer or winter, it’s great for both. Usually I break out from other moisturisers but my skin tends to love with moisture. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Oil Free Dream Come True!,"While we're all learning that most people can tolerate oil in products just fine, I am sadly not one of those people, and finding a hydrating moisturizer without oil is getting harder and harder these days. However, I have been using this for two years and can tell you it's one of the most effective, hydrating, LUSCIOUS oil-free moisturizers I have ever used! 

It feels gorgeous and non-irritating on my skin, and I love the glowy antioxidant boost of vitamin C (plus, I love killing two birds with one stone in the morning as my pocketbook is frankly over me buying separate--and expensive--vitamin C serums). I have combination skin, and find that this treats my dry skin incredibly well while also never feeling sticky or greasy, and without making me feel oily. I also love the soft orange creamsicle fragrance, and personally find this plays really well under a wide variety of makeup and sunscreen.

You can pry this baby out of my cold, dead hands as I will never be without it!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,This product is amazing! I have tried different products from different brands but I always come back to this one. I love the orangey smell and it leaves my skin hydrated and plump for the morning!

OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,"I loved it at first but it made my foundation peel, I was so sad about it because this cream really helped me out with my dullness and acne scars. I realized that I was using an silicone base primer with this gel cream so I switched to an water base one…That was the solution. There’s no other problem just pure happiness I really love this moisturizer, so refreshing!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Malaysia,ok. not bad,Was recommended by a friend to me. so far has been skeptical about any other brand for eye cream as they do no really work. but this does shows a tad improvement on my usually dark eye circle. believe they brighten my eye area a bit. but won't be getting another bottle as I think there are others out there with better result.

OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Happy with purchase.,"I'm happy with my purchase, I received this from my mom she didn't like the moisturizer and I was part of her gift set.

OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,love at first site ❤️,Stunning product with a natural glow.Highly recommended.
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Australia,Miss,"Accidentally purchased this, however it worked well for the summer being a gel type. I love the smell of this product. Didn't notice as much brightening and my skin didn't absorb it as well as it's sibling product, but I think that's due to my oilier skin being resistant to water based products."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,New Zealand,good everyday,"good everyday cream. although I would say it is more suited to younger skin as i found it quite light, i'm in my late 30s so wouldn't continue buying now"
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Singapore,moisturising,very moisturizing.. rlly good for dry skin! the citrusy smell is not too overpowering which i love! its a good pick me up in the morning so yay!  recommended
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Malaysia,Ms,This product may be good for people with extremely dry skin. I’m using this only at night as it is too creamy and not suitable for my oily skin day time. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,"This is my one of the favorite moisturizer and already bought it 4th times. I had dark spots and this moisturizer is life saver for me. I would not say that it worked magically but yes it works
 definitely."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Formula Change?,"I've used this product for years and the most recent jar used has been a terror on my skin. Looking at other recent reviews I'm not alone, this moisturizer caused several dry spots on my face. FYI people- the Dr Jart tiger grass helps repair that quickly.. sad day, but never repurchasing this product again."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Malaysia,Best moisturizer ever,"This is my second time purchase this mosturizer and i think i will switch no more.

"
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,One of my favorite moisturizers. It goes on nicely on the skin and absorbs well without making the skin look greasy. Perfect for underneath makeup.
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Malaysia,love the texture ,Not oily as compared to some other brightening moisturiser. I combine this with dewtopia night serum. I could see my skin pigmentation has lighten after 2 to 3 weeks of use. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Australia,A little goes a lobg way,I have been using this creme for close to a year if not longer and it has been great for my skin. it hydrates but does not leave your skin oily. Would recommend!

OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,New Zealand,Makes my skin glow,"I have just added this to my ever expanding skin care routine and it is so luxe! I noticed today that even though I'm still working on the surface of my skin it was dewy and radiant, something I don't recall noticing since my youth (I'm late 30s) and I think this is a big part of that. definitely recommend "
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,New Zealand,love the smell and texture,"Love the smell and jelly texture of the cream. My skin’s combine dry. I use it for summer and fall. It’s not rich enough for me in winter though. I haven’t seen the effect of brightening, but it’s definitely keeping my skin moisturized during the day."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Australia,morning fresh ,The citrus in this makes for a great morning moisturiser for fact to feel fresh and awake. used the whole container but must warn of you have a sensitive face like me it will burn a little bit the first couple of use but then my skin got used to it
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,It is pilling very bad,I like the glow that the cream gives me however...not good for morning routine when you planning on wearing make up. It is piling soo bad. I thought it might be my fault but I used it many times and tested with different creams and it's only with this one. It feels nice on the skin but makeup no make up it will still pill unfortunately.
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,super hydrating and doesnt break me out. i have combo skin
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,My second bottle and it is great. Soft skin and glowy one
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,WORTH IT!,"This product lasts me a couple of months and I have seen a significant difference. The cold winters of Canada are harsh to our skin, this works perfectly to combat those issues"

OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Singapore,my favourite moisturiser,"Repeat purchase as this moisturiser is really wonderful, it lightened my acne hyperpigmentation significantly, glides on smoothly on my skin and has a very nice finish that is not too sticky. Scent is also not heavy, overall a very pleasant vitamin c moisturiser."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Australia,amazing ,"
I love a gel cream and this one is great. Lovely texture and absorbs nicely into the skin. It didn’t make my skin look oily or greasy which is common for moisturisers to do to my skin. Also feel like it worked well with other vitamin C products to give my skin a brightened look"
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Australia,Great moisturiser for summer,This is the perfect summer moisturiser. It is a gel consistency that is very lightweight and keeps my oily skin hydrated during the summer months. It does have a strong scent but I really enjoy it.
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Smells like fake candy (like Orange Creamsicle),"I normally love Ole Henriksen moisturizers, particularly because he uses natural essential oils as fragrances in his products. Not this one. It smells exactly like an Orange creamsicle, like fake candy, not a natural scent at all. And it is sticky on the face when it dries. But I got a free sample of his new Peptide face cream (in the purple packaging), and that one smells so much better, and isn’t sticky at all. 

If you don’t mind slathering fake candy smell on your face, you might not mind this one, but it really bothers me. It smells like cheap kids products from the drug store."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,part of my everyday routine,"I started using this in August 2021 and noticed a significant difference and reduction in dullness. To be fair, I do use this with other skin care products such as keihls and dr. dennis gross but this is part of my morning and evening routine since i started. a little goes a LONG way, it's now 5 months later and i'm still on the original container i purchased. well worth it!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,"great scent, light and refreshing. the glow it gives my skin is instant!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,So light and refreshing!,"It’s a gel, so it’s very light on the skin and not too thick or heavy. It has a great orange citrus fragrances that makes me feel clean. It also produces a bit of “glow”. A little bit goes a long way. I love this moisturizer and the whole vitamin C line!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Not the best,"This moisturizer is decent for the winter months when dryness is my main concern, but it leaves an oily feeling on the skin and doesn't fully absorb (so definitely not suitable for the summer). It also has the most INTENSE orange creamsicle scent, which is honestly a bit nauseating."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,An Orange Smoothie for your Face and Hands,"First thing I’ll say is that it smells amazing! Like oranges. I like using it on my hands too because of the way it smells. (I read someone else’s review and they said they used it on their hands before bed, so I started doing it as well - loved the idea.)
I have a combination normal/oily skin type and this works well during the winter months all over. But I find that it’s a little too heavy for my oily areas to use in the summer. Other than that, it sinks right in and leaves me feeling soft and hydrated. The smell does fade, so no worries about the heavy orange smell lingering for too long. 
I only gave it four stars because it is a vitamin C brightening moisturizer but I can’t say I have seen any brightening that I can attribute to this product alone. But I enjoy using it nevertheless. Sometimes it’s more about the sensorial experience than the end result. Lol."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,Product doesn’t absorb well into the skin and I noticed limited brightening affects compared to other Vitamin C or Brightening products. Will not purchase again.
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Australia,Evident results ,"Love this product!! I’ve tried multiple creams from inkey list to Olay but this high end product is so good. I have an oily skin so the gel based Creme did perfect for my face, plus I did notice an evident glow in a couple of weeks. 

The only drawback is the price, it’s too expensive and pinches the pocket. The 50ml product lasted me 2.5 months with using it 2 times a day. 
Hoping they reduce the prices. I just ordered C-ing stars box to try the serum as well but in the future  I wouldn’t mind switching if I find a product with similar results and cheaper."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,"I’ve used the entire bottle in my skincare routine . This is a nice moisturizer to apply before makeup so it looks natural and put together. It softens the skin for sure , but definitely does not help brighten any part of your skin. Just moisturizes. I won’t buy it again because I like to use a product for what it says it does"
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,"Smells like baked goods, like cookies with oranges, but in a bad way. Did not enjoy putting it on my face. It flaked/peeled off in little bits throughout the day, too. It did feel nice when freshly applied but I could not get past the smell. It's not the worst, but for the pricepoint it's pretty close."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Wanted to love it but it didn't work,I really wanted to love this product. It made my skin feel very clean after my skincare routine. But it did nothing for brightening. I have bought it twice and saw no difference. I have oily/combintion skin and I don't think it was enough for the combination dry side of my face.
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Australia,Not the best,The only thing I liked about this was the texture and how it felt after initially applying it. It is heavily fragranced and smells like getting smacked in the face with 1000 oranges. It didn't really do anything for my skin and I found myself having to apply constantly as my skin felt drier than usual. I wouldn't buy it again 
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,It's very good moisturize and After using i feel my skin is more smooth and healty
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Wow! Why is this so good!?!?,"I have been using this moisturizer from a sample set for about a month and I have to say I really really love this moisturizer. My skin looks so much brighter and much more even. Under make up, it gives this beautiful glow. I had been using cerave everything for the last 6+ months due to my dermatologist’s recommendations but also from doing research online but this moisturizer has really taken my skin to another level. They always say you don’t need anything fancy so this shouldn’t be so good but it is, I’m really shocked by the results. I feel much more confident without make up and the reason is this product. Highly recommend. P.S. I have sensitive skin."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,"I received a sample of this and started using it while traveling. I used it 2 mornings in a row and started getting itchy dry patches around my eyes and jaw line. I have never had a reaction like this to other face products and have been using other vitamin C products, so it is something specific about this formulation."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,"The weight of the face cream is perfect, not too heavy, not too light!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,I have really skin. Especially around my nose and on my forehead. This moisturizer has completely changed that. My skin drinks it up and is so happy. No more itchy dry face!
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,My New Go-To Moisturizer,"This is my first time trying an Ole Henriksen product. After using a full bottle, I have now purchased a second one. Here’s why:
-I have combination skin so I’ve been looking for a product that combats the dryness in some areas without making my face look oily at the end of the day. I also had some dark spots from scarring of pimples from wearing masks. This product definitely catered to my needs.
-The formula feels like a gel but it glides on smoothly without the feeling of “too much product” or stickiness. The scent is refreshing and similar to orange candy. 
-I do see an “instant glow” as my skin looks rejuvenated. Over time of using this bottle, I’ve noticed that it’s become by daily go to and can be used as a primer under makeup looks. 
-I haven’t had any problems with irritation to the skin with this product which is great. 

Overall from my experience, I would recommend this product."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Not worth the price,This is a good moisturizer however it didn’t help my dark spots or brighten my skin tone at all. It did have a nice smell however and that’s about it. Definitely not worth the price
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Australia,smells so good!,Smells AMAZING! So so good! I feel reenergised whenever I use this under my eyes. I usually out it on in the morning and the smells lasts for a decent 3 hours to keep me going!
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Magic Cream,"I tried Olehenriksen after  i heard many good reviews and thought of giving it a try & am so glad i tried it.This has been by far the best cream i have had so far...very moisturising to dry skin ,made my skin look so bright and firm..would highly recommend it..Please do not discontinue this product or change its formula..Do give it a try,i am sure it wont dissapoint"
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Malaysia,Great product!,I love the feeling of applying this product and how smooth and easy it is to apply. It smells nice but not my personal favorite for a skincare product. It works great but I didnt see a significant difference after finishing the product.
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Malaysia,Light non greasy moisturiser,Great non greasy moisturiser. It does help to lighten older pimple scars. I wear this in the daytime after fresh's glow juice serum. Giving it 3.5 stars due to I feel its not as hydrating 
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,New Zealand,works great,This moisturiser has worked amazingly. Wake up with super smooth skin. Have got a lot of the other products from ole henriksen like the eye cream and the truth serum and they are great. A little pricey but just use a little and will go a long way
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Breakouts!,"I really want to love this product. I got it in the mini pack (along with the serum and banana bright eye cream). Ever since using these products, I have been breaking out so bad. Maybe because the cream is kind of heavy? Maybe I am using wrong? Still searching for a great product for brightening (that also prevents breakouts)."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,AMAZING..LIKE A MAGIC CREAM,"love this amazing product.. i had applied on to my dark elbows and underarms... it is a magic... i wish i had taken pics of before and after.. 
the dark spots are gone.. totally gone.. i can  breathe now.. and wear sleeveless shirts.. wow.. thankyou thankyou  thankyou  OLEHENRIKSEN... VITAMIN C ACTUALLY WORKED... FIRST TIME..."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,"This is a no for me. Tingling sensation, irritation and it made my skin extremely dry for a week after using it for just 3days. I’m returning it"
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Malaysia,good moisturizer,"I thought it would be of transparent gel texture but it's more of a cream. I use this day and night and it doesn't break me out. The only thing I dislike about this product is the scent, which smells yogurt-y and I hate yogurt "
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Canada,Made me break out like crazy,"My skin is normally pretty clear but putting this on my face, within a few hours to a day, I get a pimple. And if I keep using it, I get more and more. I really did give it a try, and gave excuses but the moment I stopped using it, my break outs went away. Wasn't lucky with this one."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,Australia,One of the best vitamin C product ,I loved this product because it moisturise my skin to a great extent. I usually have very dry skin and am bit fussy about using vitamin C product as it dries out the skin even more. But this gel cream leaves the skin enough moisturised and you would feel the supple and soft skin.
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Ole Henriksen C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème - 50ml,"Love this moisturizer, super refreshing, lightweight, and makes you feel fresh every morning. Really helped even out my acne prone skin. I’ve repurchased this product many times already."
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,New Zealand,shine bright...,I adore this daydream and how my skin feels after using it. I suffer from psoriasis and this cream has helped greatly. I feel like it provides all day hydration while also nourishing and providing a great base for my foundation.
OLE HENRIKSEN-C-Rush Brightening Gel Crème,USA,Big pass,"Really heavy and doesn’t sink in, just sits on top of your skin. Was more like a cream than gel. Didn’t see any difference in my skin either."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,New Zealand,wow,"this is amazing, this is my new favourite moisturiser. so smooth on the the face i will obviously get this again!!!"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Malaysia,not for me,"decided to give this a try after reading good reviews, but it's not for my skin. got more breakouts and closed comedones every time i used this. had to give it away."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Singapore,user ,Love this moisturiser been OOS ever since. Pls restock Sephora sg! Fast absorption and doesn’t affect my combination skin. Will reuse again without fail if comes back in stock. Not oily or greasy. Value for money. 
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer,"Good but not best! Finished 1 bottle but have not seen any improvement on my skin,I guess you need to consistently use it…but how many bottles needed?? Who knows…otherwise, this product sits on dry skin well not oily not matte.Dewy when applied"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,New Zealand,yeah why not,"The inkey list always makes great simple products. This is a good moisturiser, I love it with a few drops of rose hip oil mixed into it. This product does kinda have a smell to it, smells lowkey like plastic or something "
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,Good for puffy eyes,"Amazing, I use am and pm with eye cream. I love it. Worth buying it again. Highly recommend. Results can see in less than a week. Apply everyday for best results "
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,Nighttime cream,"I bought this moisturiser to use for my PM skincare routine, usually in conjunction with a retinol or BHA serum. The concentrate of peptide in this product is not too strong (~1%), and isn’t as effective as a concentrated serum. It is a lovely moisturising cream! "
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,New Zealand,meh,"I didn’t feel this gave me enough hydration. The airless pump top is fun, a clear copy of drunk elephant Retro cream. but I personally wouldn’t buy this again"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Bring back the old container!,"Great product, but I miss the old container! The little pump jar was so convenient and way easier to get every single drop out. I don't like the tube."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Malaysia,Excellent ,"This is very hydrating. it goes well alone, At night or before make up.  I use it after retinol treatment at night the most. very light on the skin. Does not go on sticky. A must have. so well priced ."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer - 50ml (Original),"love using the inky list!!!
non greasy, moisturizing & weight less."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,like packing ,i like it.. the packing is perfect. you can use full product by wasting . actually loved the packing .. the cream was good  was little strong for my skin i have sensitive skin . 
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Cheap and effective!,Its a perfect daily moisturizer at a great price. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and doesn't leave the shiny face that other moisturizers do. It goes into the skin really well so you can layer makeup over it without any issues
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,A great moisturizer,"I really like this moisturizer! My skin has looked much smoother and more hydrated since I started using it a few weeks ago. It's true that it might sting sometimes, but only if your skin barrier is damaged. Overall, I would recommend."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,New Zealand,Ms,"Nice product.  Absorbs nicely and is good under makeup.  I like that it is non-perfumed as well. No reduction in wrinkles yet, but it has only been a week!  "
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,Love this moisturizer!! It's a big drink for your face.,"This moisturizer is great, this is one of my favourites. I love the push down top. This product soaks into the skin like a dream and doesn't feel oily or sticky. It's good one for The Inkey List."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Works great,"I have such dry skin , and this product works so well and does not make me greasy. Love it. Wish they sold bigger sizes"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Horrible for sensitive skin,"I hated this moisturizer. I have sensitive and skin along with rosacea so the Inkey List chat person recommended me this. It caused a burning sensation when applied, dried my skin out, and peeled horribly. It was so gross when it peeled. You could see the product peeling and it looked like my skin. At first I thought another product in my routine caused it to do this so I applied only this after washing my face and it still burned and peeled. I don't think this moisturizer is good for anyone with dry or sensitive skin. Maybe for oily skin since it dried my skin out but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was a horrible experience all around. It also smelt bad. Which I could ignore but the product sucked in general so I feel inclined to say something."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Just started using and I really like it!!,"I just started using this and I really like it! Nice thicker lotion, or watery cream consistency. Not to thick and moisturizer pretty good! Plus it’s a great price for a good quality product! Only 4 stars because I’ve only used it a few times, I will try to update my review after a couple months of usage."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer - 50ml (Original),The smell really throws me off it smells bad to the point I’d rather not use this product and find something else. The old packaging was awesome I loved the jar with the pump on top. This was my go to until they changed it recently very sad
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,Peptide Moisturiser ,"This is probably my favourite Inkey List product. 
It’s so incredibly moisturising on the skin that you only need a little to get a great coverage. 
And it lasts a long time time too. I definitely recommend this product. "
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Decent moisturizer,"Pretty lightweight, it's nice for summer. I like to layer it under a thicker moisturizer sometimes. It works well under light makeup, too. Overall, it's good!"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Never going to purchase this again,a great product but due to the poor packaging changes I’m not going to buy again ever.
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,love it,"The only reason I’m giving this 4 stars in stead of 5 is the smell. Everything else I love. The results I love and the feel. The price point is also amazing! 
"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Don’t let the low price fool you!,This has been a staple for me for over a year!  So hydrating and calming on my skin.  I do miss the pump action packaging though.
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Burning sensation,I bought this product in the old packaging awhile ago but never got around to writing a review. It burned my skin SO BAD. I put it on as skin prep for makeup and ended up having to take off all my makeup while I was still in the process of doing it. I’ve used different products that are not suited for sensitive skin but none of them have ever left me with the burning feeling this gave me. I hated it!
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,Really nice moisturiser,Good moisturiser. Does the job. Good for dry skin.
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Malaysia,Good basic moisture ,I really liked this moisturiser. It spread really well and my skin felt nourished when I used it at night as the last step in my skin care routine. Not too oily. 
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Burning product,Doesn't help moisturize my face and leaves a burning sensation. Not for anyone with sensitive skin.
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Not the same,"I don’t know what they have changed but is not the same. I have been using this for over a year and a half, loved it. Last one I bought, makes my skin burn doesn’t absorbs at all, pills under everything and my makes my skin dry. It used to be sooooo good, no is just awful."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,Not for me,Won’t be repurchasing. Can get a better moisturiser for a cheaper price as this one contains only 1percent peptides which is not a lot. I’ll stick with a peptide serum I like and CereVe moisturiser for the ceramides. Only thing I liked was the packaging for hygiene reasons when it was in a tub and not a tube. 
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer - 50ml (Original),"I just finished this product and although it did not break out my skin, it did burn my face after each use. It is typically the only thing I will wear to bed some nights so it is this product that is causing the burning, but no redness/irritation noted."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Burns my skin and too drying,I really wanted to like this product but it's just not moisturizing enough and it almost burns my skin for a few minutes after application.
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,Perfect for dry skin,"As someone with incredibly dry skin, this moisturiser gave my skin so much life and plumped it up amazingly. I will definitely be repurchasing this product. "
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,"Great product, but go back to old packaging!!!","I love this moisturizer and have been using it for a year now! I would give it five stars, but doing 4 because of the packaging change. It seems like you get so much less product & I keep running out. ￼"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Did not work for me,"The product is drying and smells awful, would not repurchase again"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Great product.  Terrible packaging,"This is a great moisturizer that replaced a more expensive my night cream.  My skin runs dry and whenever I use this I wake up with plump, moisturized, bright skin.  However, the packaging is TERRIBLE.  The squeeze tube makes it impossible to know how much product is left and it is difficult to squeeze the product out.  A jar or pump would be much better.  Fix the packaging and this gets 5 stars!"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Good Nightly Cream,"Overall great moisturizer, a bit heavier than the Omega Water Cream, but for the upcoming winter months it will be perfect. Peptides work overtime, so no imediato results other than hydration and even tone."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,"Not for dry skin/climates, great for acne/humidity","I have been using this for almost exactly 2 months. I was liking it okay, other than the stinging and hardboiled egg scent. I have not had one single zit for that time, the longest stretch of my whole life, but I think that's more related to using zinc pyrithione soap for perioral dermatitis at the same time (a complete miracle product). I have to discontinue this moisturizer now because even after more than plenty of application, my skin is visibly dry, with the white skin dust and everything, as if I'm not wearing any moisturizer. My skin just guzzles it and is still parched. I have to really load up on my second layer, Versed sunscreen to rely on it as the moisturizer, and it's not very helpful at that either-- going to take the plunge for First Aid Beauty intense hydration and see how that works. Inkey peptide has also offered no plumping, and forehead lines are accentuated. I think climate is important here... I'm in a high, ultra-dry, wildfire-smoke climate. I think if I lived in Florida and was drowning in humidity, this product could be excellent."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Rhode dupe!!!,"Coming from a skincare snob this stuff is great! It’s a 71% ingredient match to the Rhode barrier restore cream and has that same watery cream texture and no scent, it’s also about $15 less than Rhode. 
llessless,parthis with the Inky list"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Skin care junkie approved,I’m so in love with this moisturizer.  It’s so nice on my irritated and dry skin! I’ve tried so many moisturizers and this is by far my fav
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,good moisturiser  ,"it was good, have started using another moisturiser now but is still good. "
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,Great! ,I use this as a night moisturiser and its great! Not super thick and easy to apply. 
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer - 50ml (Original),"I have been using this product for about a year and have loved it, but the last one I bought about a month ago makes my face sting and has a weird smell. When I have previously used it the moisturizer never made my face sting and it had no scent to it. I had to throw it out because I started noticing my face was reacting to it :("
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,Peptide ,"Amazing, absolutely recommend made my skin glow, and is fantastic!"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,new packaging sucks!!!,Please change the packaging!!!!! I hate this new one. The product it self is good but the new packaging is what’s preventing me from buying it again
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer - 50ml (Original),"Kind of burns my skin, and the peptide concentration is 1%? Doesn’t seem like that’s enough for it to work."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer - 50ml (Original),Horrible !  Would not buy again whatsoever don't know if the employee recommended it because as she stated she uses it or if it's because it was brand new and trying to get it off the shelf for the first time
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Perfect moisturizer,"My skin is really dry, I just needed some cheap of moisturizer. I decided to purchase this product, It unexpected in quality, I recommend you guys to try it."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Nice moisturizer - nothing ground breaking,"Good product for nighttime use for oily skin.  Woke up with skin feeling plump and moisturized, but didn't notice any major changes after going through this product.  I definitely would not use during the day on my oily-leaning skin.  This did not break me out either.  Good product for the price, and I would consider purchasing again if I needed an affordable night time moisturizer."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Singapore,meh,is moisturising but does not really provide much benefits otherwise. quite disappointed
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,New Zealand,Average,It was an average moisturiser. I liked the novelty of the bottle but apart from that didn’t see much of a difference. Also wish there was more product in the bottle. 
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer - 50ml (Original),"First impressions…am I just not getting this product? It feels/dries down like a treatment. It immediately makes my skin feel overly tight and dry. My lines are more noticeable afterwards. I describe my skin as combination. Maybe it has properties to address elasticity, but I won’t be using it as a typical moisturizer."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,HOLY GRAILLLL,"i have rlly rlly bad combination skin and i live in a tropic weather. it’s so hard for me to find a moisturizer that can target my dry spots without leaving the rest of my skin really oily. i used this both morning and night after hyaluronic acid and it works wonders <33
"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer - 50ml (Original),"i got this to try a lighter moisturizer because my heavier one was clogging my pores, but this one made me break out. maybe it can work for someone else, but it didn’t work for my combo skin. the smell is also kind of off putting."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,less is more my friends and give it time,Those who are leaving less than four stars are using to much product and are not giving this a three week trial. I have been using this for over a month now and my wrinkles are diminished and plumped. The ingredients in this make this a great value and I can not stop talking about how it has made my 30 year old skin look 25 again. I bought the other serums after trying in this.
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,bring back the old packaging!!!,"I hate this new packaging. I’ve been using this forever and was obsessed until they changed the packaging. In the old packaging, this product would last me 2-3 months. In the new packaging, I might get 4 weeks of use out of it. It claims to be the same amount of product, but there’s no way this is true. I’m going to have to switch to a new moisturizer because regardless of the price, it’s a pain to replace this so often. I swear the tube is half full of air."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,Shoddy new packaging and half empty,"The pump pot was much better, liked that it was airtight. The new tube feels cheap and was half empty, but somehow costs more for the same 50ml. Hugely disappointing."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Smells like mildew!!!,"I used to LOVE this. I’ve been using it for 2.5 years and never had a problem, back when it was in the tub. Now the packaging changed, the product has as well. It smells like MILDEW!  I ordered two and they both smell like laundry after sitting in the washing machine for a week! The packaging was dirty. And I don’t mean like ink or anything from manufacturing. It had clearly visible fingerprints of what looked like some kind of syrup! So GROSS!!"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Malaysia,neutral moisturizer,"Works like most drugstore moisturizers. Good price point and has no obvious fragrance. Spreads easily and does not clog the pore. I guess it works for aging skin better, so the rest of it goes to my mum. :)"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,my nighttime last step absolute go to,This is my last step every night in my routine my Only issue is it burns a little bit but my skin really need it a full Night time routine like I said going on it may burn a bit but it goes away and it feels like the bottle is not very full
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer - 50ml (Original),"I love the original packaging and formula. Ever since I purchased this “new” packaging, the tube is like MAYBE 3/4 full, with a different smell. If it’s not broke, don’t fix it. I’ll now be looking for a new moisturizer. Very disappointed."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Standard,"I love many items from inkey list, but this moisturizer was pretty subpar. I understand it's a cheaper moisturizer to just get the job done, but for the same price, the two ounce tube from first aid beauty was much more moisturizing for me. This is probably great if you have combo/oily skin, but I have dry skin and I had to apply it in multiple layers to get adequate moisture."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Best value moisturizer!,I love the texture of this moisturizer! Makes my combo skin glowy and plump without being oily. Only need a little bit for the entire face too. Packaging is not the best but not a dealbreaker at all
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,IN MY TOP 5 ,"I love a product that I can feel and see the effects of straight away. 
So affordable, this product is in my top five favourite moisturisers.  "
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,Decent moisturiser,"it is what it is - a decent moisturiser, nothing special, reasonably priced. no complaints! pump packaging helps keep things hygienic. will be trying more from the brand. "
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,New Packaging is TRASH!,"I loved this moisturizer! So hydrating and simple and made my skin feel silky smooth, but the new packaging is terrible! I loved the old pump pot packaging. This tube is half full and I feel like if your going to switch to cheaper packaging they could at least make the product cheaper too. I will no longer be purchasing this product. I tried to get past it but I just can’t."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Smooth and Plumped!,"My combo, over-50 skin loves this!   It's a great consistency and paired with the Inkey Glycolic acid toner, my skin feels smooth and plumped.  I did keep the former packaging, so I moved some from this tube into that one, which I prefer."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer - 50ml (Original),This is a decent moisturizer at a great price. It is unscented and good for sensitive skin.  I did prefer the previous packaging in the pump tub..
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Phenomenal moisturizer that my rosacea cheeks love,"This Peptide Moisturizer is SO soothing upon application, it is a relief to use after washing to restore the moisture barrier. The rosacea redness on my cheeks settles in no time with the anti-inflammatory properties of this light, fragrance free lotion. I have experienced no rebound redness. The instructions call for a pea sized amount for the face, which would provide an awfully sparse application. On clean skin the spreadability of the product is really good.  I use it on top of serums and other treatments; It does NOT cause pilling of my other products, but using it on top of them reduces the spreadability quite a bit, so I end up using more of the product. No big deal, but I hope they come out with a larger sized tube in the future. This lotion does NOT leave a greasy/shiny sheen, so it is a great choice to use under make-up or on makeup free days.  I've only used this product in the tube packaging.  I ike the wide mouthed tube, because when you get to the end, you can just snip off the seam and access the remaining product easily. Some products that come in pumps prevent you from accessing all of the product. I HIGHLY recommend this moustuizer!"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,it's ok,cream is nothing special. it doesn't have a very luxurious feeling to it. rather basic. the cream also really stunmy eyes and weirdly my lips too. it wasn't overly moisturising but I do have rather dry skin.
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Malaysia,peptide ,"Very hydrating. Bought for my mom. 
Good buy. 
Recommend for those looking for a good moisturiser.
Ingredients are quite impressive 
Try for your self 
"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,Juts ok ,"Not bad, but not amazing. Not overly moisturising and could possibly be used in the warmer months. But I need something more for winter. And for the price point you could find the same/similar moisturiser for less. Has not irritated my sensitive skin. "
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Great!,"Is the tube half full? Yes. But is this moisturizer amazing enough to look past that? Also, yes. This is an amazing moisturizer and after only a few days of use, I’ve noticed a significant change in my skin. Fine lines and dark spots have started to fade, and it has not caused any rashes or breakouts for my super sensitive skin. I would say this is almost on par with Drunk Elephant, except not as moisturizing. I live in a hot, humid environment so I don’t mind lighter moisturizers, but if your skin is on the dryer side you might need something in addition to this."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer - 50ml (Original),The moisturizer itself is just okay. I never felt like it did enough. But the pump on the packaging broke soon after I bought it.
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,New packaging is terrible,"This moisturizer is pretty good, but the old packaging was FAR superior. Please bring back the pump-jar thing. This squeeze tube always puts out way too much product. Like others, until the old packaging comes back, I'll probably be looking for something else. The formula is fine, but not worth the money now with the troublesome tube."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Malaysia,Easy peasy ,I’ve got nothing good nor bad to say about this product. I like that the price is reasonable so I don’t waste money on something I don’t like. I like the pump applicator. It’s light and easy to us without worry. Mostly used during the day 
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,New Zealand,Meh,"It's ok - wasn't expecting a miracle for the price.  Glad I tried it, but won't be repurchasing."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,My favorite moisturizer.,This is my second time purchasing this product and I love it. It plumps up my skin and hydrates all day. I hope they never stop making this.
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer - 50ml (Original),"My skin type is combo and I found this is the perfect AM moisturizer. It is light weight enough, but hydrating enough to wear throughout the day, and I love the glow it gives my skin. I also am a fan of this new packaging! Just wish they would make it in a bigger size"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,like it,"i really like it, because it hydrates and moisturise my skins also t is very affordable and it is works!!! definitely I will repurchased the product soon..."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer - 50ml (Original),"HATE the new packaging! The moisturizer was good, and the pump jar made it great. I hate to say this, but I’m looking for a replacement now."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Miss the old packaging,"I love this product, but knocked a star off because I miss the old packaging. I wish I had saved my old tub! This feels like a nice high end peptide lotion (comparable to the drunk elephant imo). It's what I would call mid-weight. It's not super light or heavy. It can be a night cream for oilier skin, and a day cream for dryer skin. I use it on my eye area and around my chin where I get dryness from my retin-a. During the summer I also use it as an all over night cream when my winter lotion is too heavy. Makes my skin look more hydrated and plump. Have re-purchased twice and would buy again."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,New Zealand,it’s pretty good,it’s a pretty good basic moisturiser. not my favourite but definitely not bad. not sure if i would purchase again though. it’s good for the price and does a good job at moisturising but i’ve used moisturisers that are better.
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Singapore,Ms,Very thick! Super love this HAHA also the dispenser is very hygienic as you just need to press down to release the required amount of product. Super love this as a night moisturiser for my dehydrated skin👍🏼👍🏼
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Silky Smooth Skin,This moisturizer is everything and more! My skin feels like silk after applying. I use it after I apply my Vitamin C and eye cream and before my SPF. Price point is excellent and have to say I use several of Inkey List products and they all are pretty great!
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Good Substitute for Skinfix Barrier face cream,"I was looking for something thicker for the winter and while I love the Skinfix barrier face cream, the price is too much and this is a great replacement. My skin was moisturized and soft for hours  and it's no greasy. I had the pump jar which I liked. The pump made it possible to get most of the product out. Tubes can leave a lot of product sitting inside, but I will still repurchase as long as the formula remains the same"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Malaysia,holy grail!,"What i love about this moisturiser, it works on my 30s face! One of the best moisturiser I’ve tried yet so affordable to own one. Think you need it bestie and notice the price slightly increase from last time"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,CHANGE THE PACKAGING BACK,"love but CHANGE THE PACKAGING BACK!!!!!! 
Why did you change it? The new packaging is terrible!"
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,better than I expected ,"I bought this on a whim and I've been pleasantly surprised.
I like to use it in my night routine prior to tret.
This brand has some excellent products.
I will repurchase "
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,5 star product. 1 star packaging.,"Really great product terribly packaged. The Tube is too wide, and I was only able to get about half of the lotion out of it."
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Singapore,Ms,Peptide moisturiser is a good product to start adding peptides in your routine. It works better with retinol. Best night moisturiser and also helps with smooth texture and even out the skin tone.
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Malaysia,ms,I love this product. I can use it at all times without failed. Sephora products never failed me.
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Philippines,Whip It,I like the packaging as it is hygienic. The pump comes in three holes where it is suppose to dispense the cream once pumped. One of the holes doesn't dispense any product so the two remaining holes does the job just fine. I still get enough product to spread on my face. I specifically chose the peptide to address my skin condition. I waited a year for this item to be available. Will most likely reorder.
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,The Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer - 50ml (Original),Makes my skin so smooth and soft. I loved the pump that it came with the first time!
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Singapore,love the packaging,"indeed moisturising and hydrating product! favourite part of it is the applicator, i love how you don’t have to dip your fingers into the cream and can simply pump it out and wipe off any excessive product easily to keep it sanitise "
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Singapore,repeat purchase ,"My go to everyday moisturiser. It was perfect for my combo oily skin and since it’s so affordable, I don’t even feel guilty for layering it up on my skin. Recommend! "
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Malaysia,A definite repurchase item ,I originally got it as a gift from my aunt and it's been my go to ever since. Been using it consistently for past year and my skin has never looked better.  This is my 3rd bottle. 
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,Singapore,nice ,It’s a good moisturiser and can be used in your AM & PM skincare routine. The best part of the product is the packaging. Very similar to the Drunk Elephant portini. 
THE INKEY LIST-Peptide Moisturizer,USA,"Good moisturizer, good value","I love this moisturizer. I have very dry and sensitive skin, and I find this very hydrating and soothing. In the winter I do need quite a thick layer. Interested to see if the new packaging is as good as the tub."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer - 50ml,"For me, this was a very average gel moisturizer. Not bad, but not good either."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer - 50ml,This product burns sensitive portions of my face. I thought maybe it would just take time to get used to but the irritation and stinging got worse. It dried out my chin enough to continuously peel. Really wanted to like it since I was looking for something with balance for my oily t zone and dry skin around mouth.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Australia,The only daytime moisturizer I will use!,"I am absolutely obsessed with this moisturizer and have been using it for years. It delivers a lot of moisture without feeling greasy at all. It doesn’t 
clog your pores and leaves your skin feeling absolutely amazing. 
"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Australia,Soft and comfortable to wear ,"Great moisturiser for my combination dry irritable skin, plus the cream smells really fresh. Works well under makeup as well as for night time. Layers well with other squalane based products that I use. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,Light gel but not moisturising enough,"Price is on the higher end and I was hoping to see significant performance over other products I’ve been using. However I don’t think it’s that amazing. Having said that, product itself feels light on the skin as a gel and no breakouts. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,Very basic gel not worth the price.,"Really wasn't impressed. A very lightweight gel moisturizer, but ultimately, could've been purchased at a drugstore for a portion of the price. Not worth the money."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,Not ideal for sensitive skin,"After using this product for the past three weeks, my skin has seemed more red than usual with a few breakouts. I have sensitive skin and was hoping this would reduce redness. It stung upon application and 
I just don’t think this product was a good fit."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Great for combination skin!,"Keeps my skin vibrant and hydrated! As someone with combination skin, I find it difficult to find a moisturizer that works well. Love the gel texture and has definitely helped with my acne and breakouts"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Australia,Lovely lightweight moisturiser,"I’ve been using this moisturiser for a few months now and am really happy with the results. I have combo skin with a t-zone that is prone to oiliness and shine. This moisturiser provides all the hydration I need, but also keeps the shine at bay. Feels so light and refreshing on the skin. Love it! "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,My Skin Loves This,"I LOVE how fast my skin absorbs the goodness of this moisturiser. It keeps my face hydrated, fresh AND it gets extra points for being earth-friendly too!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Pass 🙅🏻‍♀️,"I used this product for a week. I didn’t really have a lot of issues with my skin beforehand, but it could be more even. I have combo skin and this dried out my chin pretty bad, made it a little red and burned slightly. Weird."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,live this!!,"this is the first time I try this brand , I love it! I immediately purchased all of the products!!! 
also love the facial oil , i can feel my skin has became younger !"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer - 50ml,This is just ok. I have normal/dry skin and I feel likes it’s not moisturizing enough. Would not repurchase.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Great for daytime moisturiser ,"Tried a sample and love how it felt. Also thought face looked brightened so decided to buy the full size.

I like the refreshing feeling. Light, airy gel like feeling. Sometimes when I put too much, it sort of have a very slight prickly feeling but generally it does not burn or sting. 

I like this moisturiser. Nice smell too. Not in a fragrancy- loaded way but subtle wave of fresh smell? 

I can be sensitive to actives. Combi skin with rosacea and vitiligo. This seemed to work well for me thus far. 

Good stuff. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,I wanted to love this so much,"I looked at AT LEAST a hundred moisturizers, trying desperately to find one that had all the things that I wanted and none of the things that I didn’t (extra chemicals/fragrance/garbage). I would have paid anything for the right one. When I finally found this, I thought it was my holy grail. It made me break out at first, but my skin eventually adjusted. However, I have not noticed a significant difference in my skin. Yes, it moisturizes, but no other noticeable difference when I use this product vs just Cerave or something basic. Also, I CANNOT get over the packaging. It’s so unhygienic to be dipping your hands into a jar twice a day and then rubbing it on your skin. It’s also next to near impossible to get the right amount every time. It’s always too much or not enough and I have to dip in for more. With better packaging, I’d probably buy this a second time just to give it a longer chance, but as is, it’s a no from me."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,New Zealand,great moisturiser!,Love the gel moisturiser! I have combination skin so was not too heavy and could apply morning and night. love it!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer - 50ml,"I have sensitive hormonal acne prone skin. This moisturizer absorbs quickly, doesn’t leave me feeling oily, and isn’t too thick like so many others seem to be. Have repurchased 3x now."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,goodbye redness,"I bought this moisturizer because it mentioned that it helped to reduce redness and I can tell a different after only one day! Goes on smooth, doesn’t make my skin oily and you can definitely feel the hydration. Will continue to use and buy again."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,one of the better moisturiser for oily-combo skin,I’ve tried multiple moisturisers that are available in the market but this has gotta be one of the moisturiser ever. It leaves you wit hydrared smin and a natural finish
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Burning and Irritation,This moisturizer had an instant burning sensation when applied to the skin. Wouldn’t recommend to those with sensitive skin
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Australia,Absolutely Amazing,"I love this moisturizer so much, my skin soaks up this product and feels amazing after application. If you like something that’s very light weight, non greasy and absorbs into the skin and makes your skin hydrated, I would highly recommend. I will definitely be repurchasing."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Effective daytime moisturizer,"Been using this for about a month now. No smell. Very light weight and spreadable. Doesn’t peel with sunscreen. Very light finish. Keep the skin moisture intact and well preserved. Very effective occlusive. It may have a slight stinging sensation if ur skin is post an acid or retinoid acid use, but resolves quick and replenishes the hydration and protects the skin fast."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,yay,Glad to try it because its so lightweight and easy for my skin to absorb. Was finding products with squalene inside to help with my active acne and sensitive skin and finally found one suitable.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,"Great for acne-prone, sensitive skin","I wasn't expecting this moisturizer to help with my acne but it cured my blind pimples. I had managed to control 95% of my acne through other skincare products but still had some blemishes. This cream soothed my pimples and the natural redness of my skin (it's sensitive). 
I also noticed that it made my skin brighter but I don't know if I'm just seeing this because my skin is less red now. It also made my skin smooth and helped with the overall texture of my skin. 
I have oily skin and I find this moisturizer to be lightweight but it still takes some time to absorb into my skin after I have put it on.
I'd say that this moisturizer is worth the price as it not only moisturizes your skin but also helps with soothing and healing your skin."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Philippines,My go to lightweight moisturizer ,My go to lightweight moisturizer. Perfect for the hot weather and doesn't feel oily on the face. I use it for both day and night before sunscreen/face oil
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,one of the best ,"Bought this as i have tried their cleanser and toner. This brand certainly suits my skin, as this is one of the few moisturiser that doesn’t break my skin out. Am hopeful! "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,My Holy Grail!,"This my holy grail in my skin care routine! I still remember getting a sample of this and actually seeing my skin transform in a matter of days. I always struggled with moisturizers since I have combination skin where it can be very dry but also acne prone. Creams were always too heavy and would make me break out. And nothing really provided enough moisture. But this moisturizer did everything! It isn’t heavy so it doesn’t break me out, it truly helps with my dryness, it has reduced the appearance of my fine lines - especially my smile lines. And helps with my rosacea. Every time I even try something else for fun I always go back to this! It’s truly chef’s kiss!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Velvety skin,Have purchased 2 times. I love how velvety my skin feels afterwards <3
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer - 50ml,"Thanks to subscription boxes and sales, I have tried several Biossance products, and my skin adores squalane. I received this product for free in a sample box and I have been using it for several weeks. It’s a new staple for me - my skin is maturing and SUPER dry, and Biossance formulas always leave my skin feeling hydrated and happy."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Disappointed,I was a little disappointed with this product. I live in hot climate with high humidity and my combination skin can get oily and shiny. I would say this product is more suited to oily skin. I have found that it’s dried my skin and feels quite tight after 3 weeks of use. Rather than use it every day  I’ll probably change to a couple of times a week. I have given it 3 stars though because my skin is looking great as it’s reduced redness and left it smooth.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,"Great Product, Can’t Open It",I wish I could keep using this product because I actually think it’s great but I’m discontinuing and docked a star because I literally can’t open the jar. I have to have my husband do it every time because it always gets stuck. I wish biossance invested more in their packaging because they have such good products otherwise!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,yes please!,"So good! This is a thicker moisturizer so If you have oily skin, like me, use sparingly. A little goes a long way. My skin felt so hydrated and smooth after using this guy. I use it day and night. Even though it’s a gel it has a very creamy texture. Definitely a new fav"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,just meh if you’re combo skin,"It absorbs really fast which is nice, but it doesn’t really moisturize my skin. I prefer the creme formula over the gel. I typically have very oily skin, but lately I’ve been more dry. This really didn’t do a whole lot for night time at all."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,LOVE but be careful with the container,"I absolutely love this product and that it is sustainable with no harmful ingredients yet still effective, great texture, no smell. My only problem is that the cap is super delicate. I travelled with the cream and it broke pretty quickly — be careful and gentle when you travel with it."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Great Gel Moisturizer,"I recently started using prescription strength Azeliac Acid which has left my skin drier than usual. I opted for a gel moisturizer because a cream didn’t layer well with the Azelaic Acid. This moisturizer does a good job combating the dryness for me! It looks like a gel in the jar, but moisturizers like a gel-cream hybrid which is perfect for me. It layers well with other products and feels nice on the skin. Overall I recommend this for anyone who is combo/lightly dry skin."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer - 50ml,"Really like it. Good hydratation, doesn't have a strong smell."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,"Hydrating, Calming, And Refreshing! Natural Glow","This is the best gel moisturizer I’ve yet to use!! It’s super light weight perfect for day time and really works well with my combination skin! My skin gets super congested so it’s a must that I use something super light in the am under my spf. Not only is it super light it’s also super hydrating, calming, and refreshing! Love love love!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,Wondering if they changed this...,"I went through an entire jar of this moisturizer because I absolutely loved it, but I swear the next one I purchased is a different formula. It now leaves my skin extremely greasy feeling and looking no matter how little I use. I will unfortunately be hunting for a new moisturizer now and returning this one. It used to be lightweight, soak right in and it was great but now it's almost like it just sits in top of your skin... I loved it before what a shame."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,a great gel moisturiser in this heat!,"A great gel moisturiser to use in this humid Singapore and especially, with a mask on! Does its job keeping the skin moisturised despite its lightweight texture. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Australia,love this moisturiser ,A great moisturiser for the day as it’s nice and light but still moisturising. Have repurchased this a couple of times and would highly recommend. It has great ingredients and it’s fragrance free. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Australia,really good,"this is my new favoruite moisturiser, its light but is still moisturising enough for my dry skin! the texture is perfect and looks really nice on my skin. i will definitely purchase again"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer - 50ml,I liked it at first however recently I noticed pilling with this product and while it is very light weight I won’t be using it again due to this.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,Australia,Love this cream very light but effective and so gentle on my skin.  My skin is prone to allergic reactions to many products but never with Biossance products.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Best moisturizer,The ultimate moisturizer you can have! My skin feels so plump and evenly moisturized. I have oily skin but this moisturizer gives it a great balance. Feels amazing on!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer - 50ml,Amazing moisturizer for oily skin. Very hydrating and feels great after applying it. It isn’t sticky and doesn’t have a strong smell. Leaves my skin feeling really soft the next morning.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer - 50ml,Love this product! I have sensitive and oily skin and this sinks into my skin so nicely without leaving an oil texture or the feeling that your moisturizer sitting on top of your skin. Highly recommend this product.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,Worked great for me!,"I have been using this moisturizer, along with a whole Biossance regime twice a day, since October 2021 (so its been 6 months!) and I absolutely love it. I have combo/oily skin and it isn't too heavy for me at all. Feels lovely under makeup. Any redness from healing blemishes are basically gone. I also do a microdermabrasion treatment at home once a week and it really calms things down after. I love this brand!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,small bumps,Wanted to love this but it gave me small bumps on my cheek.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Daytime moisturiser for dry skin,"I used Biossance’s Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturiser solely during the day as I have dry skin. The few times I had to use it for my nighttime skincare routine, it was not moisturising enough for my skin. However, for daytime, it works well especially in a tropical climate where I’m in. Would be more suitable for oily skin, but I still enjoyed using this product. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,New Zealand,Light weight,A nice light weight moisturiser. I have combination to oily skin. I feel for my specific skin type I need a little more hydration but I can see this working perfectly for oily skin. It pairs well under makeup. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,Not Hydrating,"Not hydrating at all for my combination skin, left my face feeling tight and red with no moisture or hydration."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,"Good gel moisturizer, not for winter","Texture of this moisturizer is very light weight gel. it feels very light on skin and it has very subtle smell. This gel moisturizer alone may not be enough moisturizing for dry skin, but it feels very light on skin as if nothing is applied. I like it, but may have to look for other options in winter."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Obsessed,"I got this moisturizer because it's one of the only brands with good EWG scores. I wasn't expecting much because on the whole I don't think clean beauty delivers as good results as regular skincare, but this surpassed my expectations in every way! I have rosacea and quite sensitive, very dry skin. Despite this, I hate creamy creams so I'm always looking for a gel moisturizer that still packs a punch. I've been using this throughout the Chicago winters (harsh winds and dry heating) and my skin has stayed dewy and plump. I would never normally apply a moisturizer without cleansing my skin first, but on my laziest days I felt I could apply this just throughout the day because it's non irritating and would never break me out. My skin used to be so dry it would get tiny bumps all over as a coping mechanism / to hold onto moisture and they've completely gone since using this product. This also doesn't pill no matter what I put underneath. I've used different vitamin c serums, acids (lactic, Glycolic etc), different hydrating serums and different eye serums all together (like 5 layers) and it has never pilled! Some clean products don't hold up well over time, but travelled to Brazil with hot temperatures and dipped my fingers in here at the gym, in the airpirt and different hotels over the course of 4 months and the color, consistency, smell and efficacy is the same as when I first opened it. I seriously wish I could bathe in this."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,"Brightening, but Bad for Makeup","I picked this up after seeing it recommended for skin redness, and while it definitely brightens up my complexion and feels hydrating, it does not sit well under makeup at all. It took ages for me to make the connection between switching to this moisturizer and my foundation starting to peel off as I was applying it, but when I tried doing my face without this moisturizer, the problem was solved. I also agree with some of the other reviews that mention a burning sensation, although I just chalked it up as an ""it's working"" tingle--probably not lol."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,just meh,"at first this product was good, the smell was kinda just meh, but it did not give the moisture that i needed & it did not feel like it was doing much of anything really, it just stopped working after 2 weeks really."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Formula needs improvement,"It is lightweight and does make my skin feel silky smooth but I wish they would improve the formula. There was a few issues biossance needs to improve for me to love this moisturizer: 1. It peels and doesn’t layer well under makeup. 
2. Sometimes it has a burning sensation. 
3. The hydrating effect it has on my skin doesn’t last long."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Not very hydrating,"Personally I really hate it. It just isn’t that hydrating, period. It burns going on, for me at least, and I literally have to layer it on to feel like I have anything on. For such a small expensive jar, it’s a total waste of money."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer - 50ml,"I’ve been using this moisturizer for probably 2 years now and I have no intention on trying any other moisturizer anytime soon. This is the only product that I have not swapped out of my regimen to try something new. I have oily/combination skin, and it leaves my skin feeling very soft, even on days when my skin feels dry in the winter. Thankfully, I have not had the experiences of some other reviewers; it does not feel sticky on my skin. I would definitely recommend."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,must have,"Amazing light weight moisturizer 
Best Gel for summer day time."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,gel moisturizer,Yes yes yes. This gel moisturizer keeps my oily skin fairly balanced throughout the day. A little bit of product goes a long way.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,nice product that helps with rosacea,Really like this product. I have sensitive skin with rosacea and this calms my skin. I even stopped using metrogel for rosacea. I need to layer another moisturizer after though but I am used to layering on products. Will buy this again and again.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Sticky,"The original biossance moisturizer was too heavy for me so I tried this one. Unfortunately, it’s not moisturizing enough and my skin is a little tacky and sticky after applying."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,favourite,One of my go to moisturisers of all time. Lightweight yet moisturising which is perfect for summer. Love how it doesn’t leave a greasy sticking feeling after. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,New Zealand,Perfect day moisturiser for my combo skin,"This is a really great gel moisturiser that is gentle yet effective. It plays well with my other skincare and foundation layers nicely on top of it. With still wearing masks daily, the skin around my nose has been a little red and more sensitive and this hasn’t irritated it or caused stinging. It is hydrating without being heavy."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Australia,Made my skin dry + tight,"This cream was fine at first, but then a few days later my skin became tight and dry after each application. 

I then tried the omega +repair cream which made my face itch. I think Biossance gives me irritation and sensitivity which I don't experience with other brands (and I don't have any issues otherwise with the exception of chemical sunscreen). It's also extremely overpriced for what it is."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Australia,Summer Moisturiser,Was able to try in a sample size and loved it. I did buy a full size. Perfect for combo skin in summertime. Only problem I’ve found is that sometimes I do get pilling when wearing make up.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,Piles when used with some products,"I used this product for probably about a year and loved it but it is a little bit expensive so I decided to try a less expensive alternative. I tried a couple others but they weren’t as good as I remembered this Biossance Gel moisturizer being. So I reordered the Probiotic Gel Moisturizer and have used it twice now and it piles. I have switched a couple other face products since I last used it, so it seems they just don’t mix well with this moisturizer. Sadly I won’t be repurchasing now, but I did love it when I first tried it."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,The best,"If you have combination sensitive skin, this is the moisturizer for you. I have tried them all, but this is the one."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,Easy to use,Soaks in super easily and hydrates very well without leaving a sheen! One star off only because it is so expensive!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,light weight and hydrating ,"Bought this for my boyfriend as he have more oily skin. This is super light weight but very moisturizing, definitely does the job. If you are looking for something that is more light weight, definitely give this a try. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Much better with a facial oil,"I received this as a sample, it's very moisturizing but I find it better to put a facial oil on top because it's quite thick I use the good molecule squalane oil on top and it feels amazing so far no breakouts I wouldn't buy the full size mainly because I've had better and cheaper and yes it smells really bad but if you can get pass the smell give it a try as a sample first"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,combo oily and redness will love this,"I'm on my 3rd or 4th jar of this. I have combo oily skin and redness I can't speak as to if this has helped acne I'm in my early 30s and don't get much acne anymore and I use this in conjunction with the ordinary hyaluronic acid, drunk elephants b hyrda, and yttp cactus serum and the fresh rose toner...def not in the order I just mentioned I do my ordinary drunk elephant yttp concoction after toner and wait a couple minutes for it to sink in (I live in a dry climate rn aput 3600ft above sea level) and then put this moisturizer on and my face loves it. highly recommend this to fellow combo oily people and people with redness"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,"Awesome product, don't give up on it too early","at first, i don't really like this as it gives me burning sensation especially for sensitive skin. It was unattended for a while until I gave it another try. Smaller dose works better, it also reduced the redness and dryness."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Australia,Nice,"I kind of like this gel moisturiser. It is lightweight and moisturizing. However, there is a tingling feeling when I first applied it to my face and I'm not sure why. This moisturiser is good to use during summertime but I do not recommend it for wintertime especially if you have a dry skin type. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Oily face BE GONE. this saved me.,"Look, to each their own right? Everything works differently for everyone. But I used to wake up with an oily face as of my poor face needed more moisture and I tried A LOT. I’m a VIB rouge. I’ve tried TOO many lol. But this, this stuff is a game changer. Yes.m, it’s pricey but you don’t need that much for your whole face. My skin feels so great. It’s normally combo but my oils will peak out more at night and over produce. But this had saved me."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,"Really nice, but a little pricy for what it is","This is a really nice gel textured moisturizer. I like how it feels and it doesn't break me out. All this said it's pretty expensive, so I may try an inky list one next time but may return to this later."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,Perfect moisturizer,I've been using this moisturizer for 4 years and love it. It's doesn't have a greasy feel and always leaves my skin looking radiant
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer - 50ml,Didn’t make any difference whatsoever. Too light. Needed to layer on more products
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,"A HOLY GRAIL OF MOISTURIZERS , MUST BUY!","HOLY GRAIL OF MOISTURIZERS FOR SENSITIVE, OILY, ACNE PRONE SKIN. This is the my third empty bottle and I keep re-buying the biossance moisturizer. My skin has been loving this so much. I have VERY sensitive acne prone skin. my face is VERY picky and does not like most products I try so I have to be extra careful. I LOVE how good this smells and it does not make my face oily at all. In the winter time my oily skin gets dry so I can definitely feel how soft and mosturized it feels. I pair it with the face wash from biossance and I even noticed how it evened out my skin tone making it clearer and softer :) I LOVE THIS SO MUCH. PLEASE NEVER CHANGE THE INGREDIENTS ON THIS"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Not for me,Wanted to love this but it just didn't work for me. I used it for several weeks and it left my skin feeling dry and scaly. It caused a slight burning sensation and made my forehead to feel extremely rough.  Going back to my old moisturizer which didn't cause me any problems! (Belif).
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,"Sticky, ineffective and irritating","A sticky, ineffective product that irritates the skin.  I shipped this to my sister and it caused her to break out.  It eventually landed in the trash"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,Love this moisturizer,"Great product 
I suffer from extremely dry 
After using this my skin is no longer dry 
Some people  complain of smell, the smell disappears within seconds of applying the product 
I will definitely be purchasing this again!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Perfect for combo/oily skin!,"I have combination/oily skin and this has been my favorite everyday moisturizer for the past year. Gives my skin a lovely glow without making me oily. I don't notice a huge improvement in my redness but I do notice an improvement in texture, this moisturizer really smooths out my skin."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Nice Gel Moisturizer for Oily/Combination Skin,"This is my first time purchasing and I truly love it.  I've tried other gel moisturizers and they haven't worked for me.  Something was off, too much silicone or my skin was too shiny or sticky afterwards but this is different.  I can use it under my sunscreen in the morning and beneath my retinol in the evening."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,sad it didnt work,"ive heard so many good things ab biossance and i was so sad that my skin didnt like it. i didnt feel like it was moisturizing my skin, it actually felt irritating and left a slight burning sensation. after days of continued use, it wouldnt get better and i started breaking out more. i really think it messed up my skin barrier a little. if you have sensitive skin, acne prone skin, combo skin, or all like me, i wouldnt suggest it. just do ur research!! all skin is different"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Australia,No surprises here,"This is my second time purchasing this item and I still love how it makes my skin feel. Very happy customer 😊 As a 50+ woman whose skin is changing a lot, this gel moisturiser has been a wonderful find."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,in love,"It does everything it says it will. From someone who never thought they could use a gel moisturizer, this is my every day must have. You can’t go wrong with this one!!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer - 50ml,"My skin didn’t like this product at all. I loved how light weight the moisturizer was, especially for something to use during the day, but every time I used it I felt a very minor burning sensation. After a few days I noticed my skin started getting a very rough texture and feels agitated, so I’ve discontinued this product."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,try this out!,i actually like this moisturizer. it works pretty well with my skin and it gives me a pretty glow to my face! my skin did purge a bit when trying this out but that’s normal when switching skincare. giving this 4 stars cuz i wish there was a bit more product although a little goes a long way!:)
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer - 50ml,Had an acne breakout after application. Not the best for combination skin type.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,amazing for oily skin⚡️,Absolutely love this gel! I have very oily skin and that makes me not oily and moisturizers very well. It does not feel greasy at all throughout the day.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,Perfect Moisturizer,"Love this moisturizer so much! Originally got in a starter pack of multiple products and this was the standout, along with the Squalane + Lactic Acid Resurfacing Night Serum. Both worked wonders for my acne prone skin with deep scarring. I feel like this has changed my skin for the better."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,A Miracle for Acneic Skin,"I have an oily forehead and nose, but the rest of my skin is normal. My skin is resilient (totally okay with Rx grade retinols, strong peels, and I don’t get sunburns), yet sensitive to moisturizers. I get bumps and have resorted to using hyaluronic acid and super light serums only, as they don’t cause me to break out with bumps. I’ve tried almost every moisturizer, from natural ones to expensive ones that are hundreds, and couldn’t find one that worked. I love skincare and still asked for samples to see if I could find one that doesn’t break me out, and after years of searching, this one was finally it. During winter, I need a little extra moisture around the crevasses of my nose and the corners of my mouth, so I use a tiny dab of heavier cream or oil over those areas. This is not greasy at all and wears well under makeup. The only other moisturizer I’ve been able to use in my life was the Perricone Face Finishing Moisturizer, but that was prior to its reformulation in late 2018. I’ve been using it for a month and a half now and still no issues :)"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Australia,❤️❤️❤️,I have found something that I love and works well and I’ll be honest that I was a bit sceptical as this was a bit thicker than I’m use to so was worded that it might be to oily for me but no I was surprised 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Canada,Glory skin,Enjoyed the texture and scent. Non greasy left my skin feeling soft and smooth. No breakouts
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,HG for combination skin,"i love this moisturizer for various reasons. on top of having amazing ingredients, this is one of two moisturizers that work perfectly with my combo skin-- providing sufficient hydration to moisturize the dry parts but also being light enough to not turn my t-zone into an oil slick. this is also an all-year-rounder for me, being perfect for all seasons. can't really ask for much more than that. 

to address all the reviews that stated it burned, this product does contain lactic & citric acid which are AHAs and are meant to help exfoliate the skin for a soft & supple look, on top of helping to fade any pigmentation or scarring. if you are new to chemical exfoliants, i can imagine that you will feel this. for the aficionados, you likely won't feel a thing. side note: even though i am constantly burning the skin on my face off, i do get some strange tingling/numbing sensation within the first minute of application if i haven't used it for a while. i disregard this as it goes away and nothing bad has ever happened."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Disappointed,I heard good things about this product and I was excited to try it but it left my skin with a burning sensation and it doesn’t feel super moisturizing when wearing it. I couldn’t wear it long enough to see it’s true benefit.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Australia,Favourite Daily Moisturizer ,"I love this moisturizer use it daily. A little goes a long way feels very soothing, hydrating and works well under makeup as it's not thick. Worth the price for me! "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,USA,Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer - 50ml,"I have such sensitive skin and a true combination skin type.  I’ve tried so many different types of moisturizers only to have them either leave my skin feeling dry or breakout.  I got a small sample of this and used it for a week and loved what it did for my skin, so I bought the full size and could not be happier.  NO breakouts.  NO overly oily skin or overly dry skin.  I’m buying the whole line of skincare now!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,hope it works ,very light weighted cream. no smell. however light tingling feeling but was OK after few mins. so far face looks moisturised and non oily. let's see how it works 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream Mini,Singapore,Good,"No complain for my friend, bought it for her. Seems good and no complains of breakout"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream Mini,Singapore,so so,"this cream is not good for oily skin, it can’t control oil, with combination  it so good but at T area need to be use oil control with another product. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream Mini,Singapore,Nice,"Moisturise without sticky feeling. With the ingredients to top up on the serums used, good to complete as the final step in skincare regimen before sunscreen. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream Mini,Singapore,great fav,"love this. it will be my go to cream and, not my first purchase. highly recommend if you like something for daily wear and not too heavy. stocked up during beauty pass sale!!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream Mini,Singapore,perfect under makeup,"Been trying out a couple of DE products recently and they’ve not disappoint. This one in particular works great as a day moisturizer and layers exceptionally well under foundation. Does a great job of preventing dry flakey bits on my dehydrated oily skin, yet does not cause any pilling under makeup. Have already repurchased this in full size. Whilst pricey, I only need a little each time (1/2 to 3/4 pump). "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream Mini,Singapore,Hydrating moisturizer ,A light weight moisturizer with a gel cream texture. Very hydrating and soothing to skin.I use it along with retinol at night  as well as a primer under makeup. It gives skin a smooth and plump look.Love it.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream Mini,Singapore,I wanted to like it,"I wanted to like this product because I trust Drunk Elephant products and love their composition.
This cream spreads perfectly and gives a really good feeling of calmin your skin's thirst when you apply it.
However, after some time of use I developed tiny little spots on my forehead and realised this was not the one. Sigh.
"
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,it’s a ok product ,Bought for a friend. She loves it. But Laneige products are subjective. It doesn’t work for me and caused me outbreak or redness everytime. But friend loves it. 
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,Laneige Cream Skin Refiner,Thought it was going to be a little more refreshing - feels kind of oily in a way. Think applying it on the face with a cotton pad is more practical rather then patting the product directly from your hands. 
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,Very nice ,"First time trying this from Laneige and really like this. Very suitable for normal to dry skin. As a toner, it is very hydrating. I use this sometimes  as a quick hydrating mask by soaking it in thin cotton pads. "
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Malaysia,Nice,"Overall it’s good product and suitable for my dry combination skin. It’s hydrating without feeling sticky. More importantly, it doesn’t cause break out on my sensitive skin."
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,Not a wow product.,Not really sure how it has impacted my skin as I did not noticed any difference after using it for 2 weeks now. Did not breakout from this so I guess it is okay? 
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,Holy grail,use this as a toner before moisturiser - it's thick enough I use just this and a serum and sunscreen for stay home/WFH days. Great for locking moisture in 
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,nice texture,Have yet to try it with my other products but I tried a little in store and really like the feel of it! It’s really popular too so I hope it’s works well! 
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,good product ,i bought this for my friend a week ago she had really dry skin n she told me that after 1 use she felt the difference she would be getting more if u hv dry skin i really recommend this product 
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,Mdm,Made this purchase after a bottle gifted to me on Christmas was empty. Like how light and easily absorptive to my skin this product is. May be too light if you’re looking for proper hydration. Texture is watery so may have a tendency to pour too much.
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,Viral,"Jump onto the bandwagon. Decided to buy because I can't stop seeing beauty influencers raving about this toner. It's not as thick consistency as I expected, just like common toner"
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,very moisturising ,"Very moisturising and skin feels very soft and doesn’t feel tacky. Its great for dry dehydrated skin. Would definitely repurchase again. Worth every penny
"
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Malaysia,good ,"Overall is a good toner, I am used to the light refiner moisture line from laneige. But overall this is is an okay toner. Nothing to complain but not raving over it either. "
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,Moisturising Toner,"Honestly, bought this because of Liah Yoo. Also glad I did because its my holy grail when my skin is all dry and patchy in need of that moisture! Even my mom loves this!"

LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Malaysia,a staple,"i think everyone should try this!!! i love this so much, leaves a film on my skin and keeps my skin hydrated especially in an air conditioned room where my skin tends to get dry, love it so much "
ALLIES OF SKIN-Retinal & Peptides Repair Night Cream,Malaysia,forever a fan of allies,Fav brand on Sephora discovered!! I love love all products gotten thus far. This really improves my skin condition and color. Can feel the softness of skin every morning when I wake up. Recommend!! 
ALLIES OF SKIN-Retinal & Peptides Repair Night Cream,Singapore,best retinol,"This retinol product does note dry out nor irritated my skin. Gave me the best results, less prominent lines and wrinkles, and lasted a realky long time. A bit expensive but it’s quite huge so I think it is worth it. Can also try this when its on sale. Excellet product. All Allies of Skin as so amazing and if superior quality. That explains the prices."
ALLIES OF SKIN-Retinal & Peptides Repair Night Cream,Singapore,"Wonderful formula, bad packaging","Strong retinoids came from retinaldehydes, together with peptides & other antioxidants are quite powerful on the skin with minimal irritation. I don’t say there’re no irritations, this formula flares up my eczema on the neck but can be anticipated with sandwich methods. Sadly, the packaging is not the best despite the hefty price tag. "
ALLIES OF SKIN-Retinal & Peptides Repair Night Cream,Australia,Super,Does exactly what it says
ALLIES OF SKIN-Retinal & Peptides Repair Night Cream,Malaysia,loving this ,Bought this a few Sephora sales ago & was waiting to finish up my open Promise Keeper mask. I shouldn’t have waited. Absolutely love this - I wake up the next day and my face just looks so much more rested & refreshed. The only thing is I’m not sure if I’m using it the “proper” way as it’s my last step at night. Because its got the word “mask” in its name.
ALLIES OF SKIN-Retinal & Peptides Repair Night Cream,Singapore,not bad ,A tad drying but overall it is a good product. Will buy it again 
ALLIES OF SKIN-Retinal & Peptides Repair Night Cream,Malaysia,A magic potion!,Ok where do I begin with this product? All i can say is a miracle in a bottle and I am really glad i tried it out during 40%. What a steal. You wakeup with healthy hydrated glowing complexion after you put this on a night before. Skin appear brighter like after a night
ALLIES OF SKIN-Retinal & Peptides Repair Night Cream,Malaysia,Great moisturiser with retinaldehyde ,I used this right after toning my face and my skin feels nourished after the application and the next morning I feel my skin is smooth and hydrated. Didn’t experience any irritation with this moisturiser. Will repurchase again if it comes back in stock. 
ALLIES OF SKIN-Retinal & Peptides Repair Night Cream,Singapore,Love it,Gentle retinal that works so well and non irritating. Will repurchase! 
ALLIES OF SKIN-Retinal & Peptides Repair Night Cream,Malaysia,The Best ,The best Retinal! I don't have any sensitivity with this and my PIH  reduced tremendously. highly recommended and it is such a steal because I got this during sale 
ALLIES OF SKIN-Retinal & Peptides Repair Night Cream,Malaysia,Great Night Moisturizer,"For a retinal product this is surprisingly gentle and non-irritating. I really enjoy using it as my moisturizer at night! It’s also not too thick, but feels very moisturizing at the same time."
ALLIES OF SKIN-Retinal & Peptides Repair Night Cream,Singapore,Goodbye Big Pores,"I bought this product for anti aging prevention from Retinaldehyde (Vit A derivative). In my early 30's I don't have any visible lines yet. So it's kind a for maintenance purpose. 
But I noticed the other benefits from this product. My pores appears smaller! After 5 months of used, I no longer need a primer before make up. My foundation is intact beautifully on the skin.
The other benefit is during monthly cycle, when acne often coming. This product helps. If I applied it at night, on the next day my acne seems no longer inflamed and it went away gradually. Which is great, so that I don't need to deal with acne scars anymore.
  "
ALLIES OF SKIN-Retinal & Peptides Repair Night Cream,Malaysia,retinaldehyde,I have tried retinoid products before! Time release retinal formulations incorporated with peptides and brighteners! Moderate effect of retinal but its super hydrating! Need to use longer to see its maximum effect! 
ALLIES OF SKIN-Retinal & Peptides Repair Night Cream,Australia,Amazing,"I just love allies of skin and this product in particular. This product is one of my favourites, definitely will be using this again and again. My skin is always glowing in the morning."
ALLIES OF SKIN-Retinal & Peptides Repair Night Cream,Malaysia,A miracle to my skin!! ,"I have spend countless on products and facial treatments to get a firm, moisturize and brightened face. Nothing came close to this amazing product, the result can be seen overnight!!!. I got this as a sample in the beginning and upon first application, my face became soft, supple and brightened the next day. So I bought it in full size and have been applying every night before bed. "
ALLIES OF SKIN-Retinal & Peptides Repair Night Cream,,Hmmm... it’s ok,This is super hydrating and nourishing but I’m not sure the retinol is as effective as in other products I’ve used. But it’s really nice for a super boost of overnight hydration if you have dry skin
FRESH-Day & Night Hydration (Christmas Limited Edition),Singapore,good value set!,"Bought it during sales, it's a good value. Comprise of my daily favorites - the overnight mask and soy facial wash. The overnight mask feels nice on my combination skin without being greasy."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,New Zealand,soothing and hydrating ,"This is a really lovely, soothing moisturiser. I would say it is mid weight, so for my combination to oily skin, I use this in the evening. It’s nourishing and doesn’t really smell like anything to me. One star off because I don’t feel that the ingredient list justifies the price point - so I wait and buy it on sale. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,favourite moisturiser ever ,I’ve repurchased this over and over and over again. Perfect for my dry skin. Ultra hydrating and great morning and night. A little bit goes a long way so a tub lasts a good amount of time. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,Love!,"I received the small jar as a birthday gift and just bought the big jar. I have been using this as my night cream and when I wake up my skin is lovely, soft and hydrated. I have normal to dry skin. 
I read that some people don't like the smell but I much prefer this over something artificially perfumed. Plus you can't smell it once it's rubbed in. Also, a little goes a long way. Love it!
Note: I have used this in winter/spring, not sure if I need something lighter for summer."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Singapore,Moisturiser,Texture is cream and it is good for night use. Will repurchase again
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,Thick night cream,"I found this great to use at night and woke up to really hydrated skin. The smell is funky but I don’t mind it, quite pricey for what it is but good if you need extra hydration. I wouldn’t recommend if you live in a humid place and want to use as a day cream, it did leave me oily in the summer "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,All fixed ! ,"I absolutely love this repair cream, it’s help me balance out the moisture in my skin and it’s never been better, a little also goes a long way! I had my skin reviewed when I went into Sephora by a skin specialist and she recommended this and I haven’t looked back. It’s been my go too! So hydrating without causing any blemishes or breakouts. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Singapore,Good purchase during sale,Enjoy using this. Gives me the hydration I need. I only use this at night before bed. Its sinks into the sink. I use my lactic acid first followed by this. So far liking this.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,Super hydrating ,"I love this moisturizer, it’s so hydrating but doesn’t leave my skin feeling oily or heavy and it has calmed down my redness a lot. It also helps my skin to heal faster and I find it lasts a long time too. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,Everyday Staple,"Really great moisturiser. I have sensitive skin on the dry side and this works nicely. It's really gentle, great layered with other products during the winter time and I think it will be good over summer as well when my skin is more combo.  "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Singapore,make it make sense ,i don’t understand how i can always rely on this to save my skinnnn. used to use it during the day too but i realised it can be a bit too rich. i’d say 1 jar lasts about 3-4mths of daily night uses. mix a tiny bit of this with a gel moisturiser during the day for a well hydrated face for full full face makeup days! 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Singapore,Biossance Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Biossance Squalane + Omega Repair Cream doesn’t give me breakouts. It’s lightweight and non-greasy. Hydrating without that unpleasant gluggy after-feel on the face.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,great cream,"after trying a sample size pot, i bought this straight away. I use it as a morning cream, finally found a cream that not only moisturise my dry skin but works well under my makeup without pilling. The issue i have with creams that do moisturise enough is they don’t then work under foundation. This cream also is great for redness. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,average moiturizer ,just an average moiturizer for me. not worth the price. it does moiturizes the skin. but seriously you can get other moiturizer for much cheaper price.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Singapore,Great One,Absolutely love this product… the texture is quite fluffy and it doesn’t feel too heavy… I had some allergies recently n my hands were peeling … I got some residue left over after moisturizing my face n I worked into my hands n viola my hands were all smooth n there isn’t any peeling skin left… works perfectly for a night time moisturizer… just one con … I don’t like the scent but it’s bearable.. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,my new love ,So I usually use the other moisturiser but again they didn’t have it in stock when I was in. In saying this I’m so glad I got to try it. I actually love it more.! It a bit heavier to put on at first but it’s not oily or to much. I’m actually finding this provides that bit of extra moister I need atm.  
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,Excellent! ,"I found this moisturiser when I had a sudden bout of dry skin during my pregnancy. Nothing would work to relieve my parched skin, and if I found something that did- I would get really congested then break out. 
Then the clouds parted- and Biossance Omega Repair descended from the heavens. Thick, Creamy, Hydrating- yet light, non-greasy, non-irritating, and no congestion or breakouts. The result is supple hydrated creams, time & time again. Its only drawback? The smell. But it’s faint, and doesn’t bother me in the slightest. I much prefer an unscented product’s scent- than perfumed products that smell artificial and chemically. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Malaysia,Major Love,"Bought Biossance product during a promotion few weeks ago as it was worth it considering the price factor. I use it for my night time routine and finding myself skipping facial oil in lieu of this. It’s thick, provide a good moisturisation & felt so luxurious on the skin. I pair this with Biossance copper peptide serum & I wake up to well hydrated & moisturised skin in the morning. Many complained about the smell, I can see where they come from but the scent dissipate as soon as you smooth out the cream on your face so it was no biggie for me. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Malaysia,Love love love,"I read that people hate the smell, but it doesn't bother me. The fact that it is unscented works well for my sensitive skin. It deeply moisturizes and does not leave an incky feeling at all. love. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Malaysia,Cream 50ml,My dehydrated oily skin loves it. It’s thick texture not triggering acne and pore clogging. Reserve for nighttime routine cause its too dewy for me during the day.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,rich and creamy,"Beautiful texture, rich and creamy and nourishing. Great for dry skin which I have. On the pricey side but worth it for when you want to spoil yourself"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,strong odour,"I used this product only twice. And it’s so strong and disgusting that I didn’t even bother applying it after that as I just could not tolerate the smell. So I unfortunately don’t know how it would have made my skin feel. 
For the 2 nights that I tried it I actually felt my skin looked duller if anything "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,amazing feeling ,"Feels amazing on the skin, plumpness and hydration instantly, feels like small lines have reduced in an instant, can’t wait to try more products from the same line "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,Literal heaven for the skin ,"I usually use Youth to the People Adaptogen cream but I found it wasn’t hydrating enough. This moisturiser is literally heaven!!!! My skin has never felt or looked better. The comments about the smell are definitely true but for how amazing my skin is, I’ll buy this product for the rest of my life. 

The smell reminds me of a wet dog smell… but it doesn’t last long, only while you rub it in, then it’s gone. I use a lot of fragrance free products but nothing has ever had this level of smell. 
But honestly, forget the smell. I have hyper sensitive, red flushed, oily/combination skin and it’s the PERFECT day & night cream. Can’t recommend enough!!! "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,Hydrating,"People said the smell is bad, but it's really not that bad. It's super hydrating, but didn't do much for my skin."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,really nice,"such a nice and thick moisturiser, works well to moisturise my dry skin! the only thing is that it has a faint smell that i personally don't like, but its pretty faint and goes away."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Malaysia,Great for dry skin,"For someone with dry skin, this cream works for me as a day and night moisturiser. I like that it is fragrance free and doesn’t cause any reaction to my sensitive skin. I have repurchased this several times already and would continue to do so. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,"hydrating, nice finish, but not for me",This had a lovely texture and finish and was hydrating but not enough for me in winter. It caused me to get small pimples here and there fairly consistently which stopped when I bought another moisturiser that from my analysis seemed less comedogenic.  
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,New Zealand,Holy Grail,It's definitely an investment however I can't go without this moisturizer. I've tried others but still end up back to this one - my absolute fav <3 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Singapore,repair cream,"For the price, there are better moisturisers out there. Due to my sensitive skin, this product causes my skin to break out after a few days of using it. Not sure is it the serum or the moisturiser but it makes my skin dry too. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,“AMAZING” Highly Recommended!,"I’ve been using this moisturiser for more than 5yrs and still is my favourite. Each time I apply it I feel my skin is thanking me!!! Hydrating+++++ It is a thick one and that’s why it’s recommended for dry skin, however, depends on individual skin it works pretty good for me (combo). Depends on my skin need, but most of the time I use it day and night as it gives me perfect hydration and lasts long. 
"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Singapore,Great buy,Love this as it’s moisturising. Took off half a star due to the smell. Will want to try done other Biossance product and hopefully there’s promo so gift set. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,Pretty much perfect,"Amazing moisturizer, beautiful texture that's thick but not too thick, absorbs perfectly and doesn't feel heavy, feels so hydrating and nourishing, plumps, repairs, wears well under makeup, definitely makes a difference, ingredient conscious too. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Singapore,moisturizing and lovely texture ,Bought it during sale but still think that the price is quite steep compared to other moisturizers.  I love the ingredients and it protect my skin and keep my barrier healthy and moisturized.  
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Singapore,Amazing Cream,"i love bioassance’s products, they are all really effective. The Squalane + omega repair cream is one of my favourite products from them, it is super moisturising and leaves my skin glowing. one thing is that the smell is really strong but i don’t mind the scent"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Singapore,biossance squalene + omega repair cream,Recommend to all. But must tolerate a smell which I just stop breathing when applying on my face. It’s really moisturising.  I use as night cream. All the gem inside this bottle. I have sensitive and combination it suit me and will buy again  
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,New Zealand,Pretty good,"I do enjoy this moisturiser, my skin always feels hydrated once I use it, I think there could be some equally as good moisturisers out there that are cheaper and don't have a funny smell to it."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Singapore,Amazing!,"Even though this product is recommended for drier skin, my combo skin (normal with oily in t-zone) absolutely loves it! I use it at night only and wake up with radiant skin. Will buy it again for sure."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,Not too bad for combo skin,"I think this would be better for dry skin as it did feel a little heavy for my combo skin. However, I just used a bit less which also made it last longer. It feels nice on  the skin and is definitely hydrating, good to use at night as you wake up with fresh skin. 
The smell isn't as bad as other people say. If you only use highly perfumed products you might not like it. But lets be real, you're using this for its skincare benefits not to make you smell good.  "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Singapore,pungent smell,"The smell of this product is too overpowering/overwhelming. Very hard to ignore it. after applying to face, the smell will be less obvious. Will not repurchase "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Malaysia,Worth it -  suitable for 40s,"Im so glad i got to lnow this product. Forst of all i want to say that the smell is not bad at all. Before purchasing this, i got to read a lot of reviews and they dont like the smell. I have no problem with it. Its very hydrating since i do have a dry skin. I highly recommend this for thos who have dry skin. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Malaysia,best for dry skin,I love how moisturizing this cream feels on my skin. This is something that I enjoy using at nighttime skincare routine after my acid serum. Woke up with healthy glowing skin ! I had no more issue with dry patches . Even though sleeping in air conditioning room my skin feels hydrated in the morning. Haven’t tried this in my morning routine yet. Im a loyal user of it cosmetics confidence in a cream. So let’s see if this cream could beat my it cosmetics 🤣
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,New Zealand,so comfortable,This is like a comfort food for the skin it’s so deeply moisturising and even when my skin is super sensitive from retinol it doesn’t burn and instantly nourishes the skin the next morning 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Singapore,very moisturizing,"Be warned: this moisturizer smells lk blue cheese but after a while, the smell goes away after you apply it. I finished my jar of La Mer and thought this would be a cheaper alternative. Love the ingredients but sadly it’s too rich to use for day time (with my sunblock). Perfect for night time, under the aircond. Kept my skin moist the whole time. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,Love,"I have dry, sensitive, allergic skin and this is amazing and really soothing and nourishing. I love that it’s unscented. I use this over the top of the phyto-retinol and it’s a perfect combo "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,I Love This Cream!,"I love this cream, it is one of the silkiest and lightest creams, yet so moisturising. Initially, I didn’t quite like the smell, but after a week or so I can say I thoroughly enjoy it - it is earthy and natural. After applying this, I use Biossance squalane and rose oil and the combo does wonders for my skin, neck especially. Highly recommend!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,Rich and moisturising ,"Love this moisturiser, it’s the third time I’m purchasing it. I have dry skin, this is quite thick and rich- but leaves your skin feeling soft, hydrated and moisturised. Absolutely love it! "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,Holy Grail!!!!!,I am on accutane for rosacea and have now finished my 3rd tub of this cream! At first when I used it I found it drying because I wasn't using the product immediately after washing my face. But when I started putting the cream on with a slightly damp face it was a game changer. It's so thick and hydrating!! It's the only moisteriser I have been able to use on accutane that genuinely keeps my skin hydrated. Also my cream has never had any smell to it unlike what other reviewers have said... maybe I have a dodgy nose? haha it doesn't smell like anything to me
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Malaysia,Thick texture,Bought this because influenced by Beauty Within.     Used it as my sleeping mask.     Quite thick texture but non greasy at all.  Packing 5 stars product 5 stars too         
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Malaysia,Helps skin glow,"This is one of my favourites to apply at night. It does feel a tad oily but I don't mind as I usually use it in my night routine. When I wake up in the morning, my skin is all soft and glowy. Love this product. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,Not something I expected,Unfortunately I had a really bad reaction to this cream. After the second and third use I started to develop acne. I have since discontinued using the product.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Malaysia,Enjoyed it ,"Light on the skin, it has a natural (sometimes sour-ish) smell if you’re ok with it. No fragrance and non-greasy. Have dehydrated skin so needed a little more boost than this but enjoyed it on days that I wanted a lighter feel and moisturized night.  "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,Favourite ⚡,"I have an extremely oily t-zone and super dry cheeks. So this cream goes on my cheeks only. And it's the best. I love it bc it really hydrates my skin and the ingredients are simple and correspond with serums I use (I don't like using moisturisers with a long ingredient list, bc my serums are rich enough). Recently repurchased and I'll be in the future. A little goes a long way, believe me. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Malaysia,great evening cream,"Love this for my evening cream. It smell a little ""funky"" but very bearable. I have a really dry skin, I combined this with Biossance rose vitamin C and wake up to moist skin. Happy with it! "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Singapore,not a fan of the smell,"Felt like the cream was a little too thick for an all year round sunny climate, at least for my skin. But what threw me off the most was the smell of the omega in the cream. I heard many good reviews about this product and thought of trying it without first buying a smaller sample, I regret my purchase now. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Singapore,really good,"not too oil for morning cream and nice as an evening cream too, i am dry and early aging skin, skin loves this and wake up with a smooth and clean skin,

"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,P,"Even though it said that we can use this in the morning, I think the texture is quite thick. My skin is quite dry in winter, work well at night. 
I usually mix this with 2 pumps of the same brand retinoids products. Very effective!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Malaysia,omg no one told me about the smell,why didn’t anyone mention the smell of this thing? 🤮 texture is nice but man its stinky. great to repel your husband before bed. this is gonna be a slow finishing up process.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Malaysia,Ms,"This has to be one of the best moisturisers I have ever tried. Yes it’s pricey, but I wake up with really soft and supple skin, smooth and just lovely. I even like how it smells like cocoa nibs. Luxurious but not heavy and it really feels nourishing. Worth the spend."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,LOVE LOVE LOVE,THE best night time moisturiser I have ever used. hands down. l leaves my skin so soft and hydrated. 3rd time purchasing. Also recommend the gel moisturiser for daytime use!!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,Beautiful for dry skin,I rate this product highly. I have very dry skin and this is beautiful and rick with a nice thick consistency. Applies really nicely over serums and essence. It’s in scented. It has a little natural scent that goes away in 1 minute. Will absolutely repurchase!! 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Malaysia,One of my favorites,"I bought this after finishing the sample.  It's one of the best moisturizers that I've tried.  My skin is very picky about what it likes and doesn't.  I have dry and sensitive skin.  I've tried many moisturizers including Tatcha Water Cream, Drunk Elephant Peptide Cream, First Aid etc and there are always issues like tiny red dots would appear, not hydrating enough, my skin gets irritable etc.  But this applies beautifully with a soft velvety finish.  My skin feels more supple, nourished & moisturized through out the day. However for people with oily skin, you may feel it's a tad oily."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Malaysia,Ms,"This is magic packed in a very elegant bottle. It has helped reduce my acne scars and hydrates my skin effectively. It has a very odd smell ( like fermented rice) however it isn’t a major issue, as it lasts for only 1-2 seconds then just disappears. Most importantly it does what it claims to do and all you really need is a tiny amount, so 50ml does last for at least 3-4 months. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,HOLY GRAIL,"This is my Holy Grail of Moisturisers.
It is thick and hydrating and in the morning my skin is glowing. Even though it is thick it never leaves my skin oily. I have used this on top of a plethora of other products and it has always given me great results. 
"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,Disappointed with Sephora’s customer service ,"Please be advised the once the order has been placed, we can no longer make any amendments. As much as i would like to edit the order, since the order system is secure, we will not be able to change the details of the order.

So disappointed with Sephora’s customer service
"

BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Omega Repair Cream,Australia,Luxurious ,This my my fave moisturiser ever!! I usually prefer gel moisturisers but the omega repair cream is surprisingly light weight and luxurious that my skin care routine isn’t complete with out it! It seals in moisture levels and isn’t too greasy on my face.

INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,Australia,Great!,"Beautiful jelly moisturiser, for glass skin effect. Great for oily/combination skins, not greasy at all. One star less cuz takes a while to absorb leaves the skin tacky for a bit. "

INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,Australia,LOVE THIS!!,"This jelly cream is so refreshing and hydrating. It’s so cold when it goes on and it’s so fun to apply. It smells AMAZING without being overbearing or irritating skin. I have dry, sensitive combo skin, and my face hasn’t been this hydrated and glowy in years. Highly recommend will definitely buy again. "
INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,Australia,awesome under makeup,"Gives you a glow that’s for sure and it’s fantastic under makeup if you like the dewy look.
It doesn’t do to much skincare wise that I’ve noticed but I haven’t even gotten close to finishing the jar.
It was absolutely filled to the brim!"
INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,Australia,awesome ,This is my 3rd container of this it is so good when used in unison with the Jeju Cherry Blossom Tone Up Cream. It makes my skin look gorgeous and brighter (those who like lighter complexions). 
INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,Australia,Must have!,"Combination skin / hard to explain, I love the texture and smell. I have put this in my mini fridge and use once it cold. Omg! Girlssss it felt so good. Did not give 5 stars because I don’t like the packaging."
INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,New Zealand,Mrs,"Just love it, very soft texture on face, more like a gel that gives you glass skin look. I used with the makeup and that change my whole makeup look. Also I can use if for everyday moisturiser"
INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,New Zealand,lovely,"this is such a beautiful hydrator..I really love how it makes my skin glow, it isn't stick at all. I really like the delicate scent, it's not strong and makes you feel refreshed. I definitely recommend 👌 "
INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,New Zealand,BEST PRODUCT EVER,"BUY THIS RIGHT NOW. I use this after my moisturiser and just before SPF, it makes my skin glow and feels so soft. Also a little goes a long way, this product will literally last you a lifetime. I can't express this enough BUY IT."
INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,Australia,Morning Routine Goat ,I wear this in the morning w Vit c and Sunscreen. It has a more matte finish rather than shiny. It makes the skin look incredible and I love the texture and consistently. Perfect for my morning routine. Highly recommend! 
INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,New Zealand,consultant ,"A little bit too sticky for me. Reviews are spot on. It can pass off as a primer. It's tacky and thick but at the same time feels really hydrating! I guess I'll be using it both ways then. No regrets 
"
INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,Australia,Works well,"Love the packaging and the little spatula it comes with, love the (very mild) scent too. Works well for dry skin but don't think it would be great for oily skin cause it does make your skin look a little glassy/tacky after use. Haven't had any issues with this under spf&makeup so far."
INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,Singapore,perfect primer,"I use this jelly cream as my primer, provides a sticky base for makeup to adhere to. As a moisturizer, i found it insufficient in the hydration department but excellent as a primer!"
INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,Singapore,meh,Very sticky even after a full night has passed in an air conditioned environment. No dewy look for me except hair all over my face because of how sticky the product is. Not a fan of this product. Wouldn’t recommend
INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,Australia,love it,So far I am liking this innisfree jeju cherry blossom jelly cream very light weight and very hydrating skin feel dewy and fresh will definitely buy it again
INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,Australia,love it!!,Soothing and lightweight on the skin and isn't heavily fragranced!! 
INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,New Zealand,M,Love this so much..so refreshing for skin great to put on freshly washed face not greasy lovely and light on skin.
INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,Australia,Tasneem ,Super dewy on skin ans it will make you look so hydrated. Smells really good as well and is so moisturising. Amazing product.                               
INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,Australia,so lightweight ,"So lightweight, so fun. It smells great without being too fragranced and a little bit goes far. Nothing to criticise with this one, I’m glad I bought it. "
INNISFREE-Jeju Cherry Blossom Jelly Cream,Australia,Gentle non-greasy moisturizer.,"This product is super lightweight, non-greasy, no colourant and very, very low scent (it just kind of smells like cold water to me). Great value as the jar was filled to the brim and only a small amount is needed as it spreads really well. Also includes a little applicator spatula thing for those people who don't like to stick fingers in jars."
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Essentials (Christmas Limited Edition),Australia,the items in this set are amazing,"I love the overall smell and way this set makes my face feel, it's been nice to try seeing as I've never used products like this before, definitely worth the purchase!"
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Essentials (Christmas Limited Edition),Singapore,Nice!!!,"have not tried all the products, only tried the rose mask, oil serum and the toner. so far am loving it the mask really softens the face and the smell makes me feel like it's a pamering session each time I use it. Will definitely repurchase!!!!!! the oil serum does it's job by really hydrating the skin. 4 stars because the petals in the toner sort of hinders the exit"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Malaysia,not sure,i find this just meh. did not see any differences or improvements to my skin. i have since switched to one from another brand and i see better results.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Malaysia,so far hasnt seen the result that im looking for. ,"Tried this, and at the beginning i get dried skin. I still use it but i dont know if its showing any result that im looking for. So far none. Bit disappointed cause the price tag is rather on the high side"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Malaysia,ok ,"bought this for my mom, didn’t show much progress, but i think she likes the ordinary retinol better compared to this one as TO one got combination of squalene oil as well? Hence it moisturized her skin well "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,I love the Consistency,"I have tried to leave this product multiple times for products like Sunday Riley and Khiel’s but immediately start to notice that my skin doesn’t look as good. This made my gross pores look like I was wearing a filter. I would make sure you are waiting at least 5 minutes after you put this on before you put anything else on or moisturize. It made a big difference for me. I’m able to use nightly if I want, but usually do lactic acidosis every third night or"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Malaysia,nothing special for me i think,"The price too expensive, i dont know why so expensive because for me nothing special about this retinol.. just okay only.. because my face did not have any problem, so i use it for trial , nothing happend.. like i say “just okay only” like a hydrating cream only i think "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,A must have!,"I love this product, especially with the hydro boost serum. It took two weeks and my skin was purged (dont be scared about it) and now my skin is becoming more and more clear! I look forward to using it"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,Amazing retinol,The best retinol product I've ever used and the only one I've seen results from. Reduced my hyperpigmentation to the point that you can barely notice it. Be careful about how often you use it when you start as it is quite strong. Don't use it two days in a row until your skin is used to it.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Pfffft useless.,"I’ve used two full tubes until they were empty and saw absolutely no change. I used it three times a week, as my moisturizing step for nearly six months. Overpriced and overhyped."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,"Be cautious with the amount, because it is strong","It had been a while since I used retinol, so I decided to go slow. I like the texture of this cream, however, I would love to use the world serum, because you don't want to use a vast amount. I think using a pea size is too much ( that is what is recommended in the instructions). I have pretty sensitive skin, also as I said it had been a while ago since I used retinol so a pea size amount would be shocking to my skin . If you have the same issue, I rather recommend using more like a peppercorn size, and perhaps mix it with their hydrating serum."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,good ,Bought this during the sale for my mother. She used to use it when it was still in a tube. The new packaging is easily to control the amount and much easier to store plus getting out all the product 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 10ml,"I got a small size of this to try out, and I am so glad I did. I'd been using a retinol cream every other day for a while, but upped to every day with this. I have had a bit of purging, but I can already tell that it's working. Definitely love this product."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Decent,"I tried the mini size when it first came out and came in a tube. I thought the consistency was too thick for a serum, it felt more like a moisturizer. I think people with dryer skin would like the consistency. I didn’t feel like I saw any progress with my acne scarring compared to a brightening serum.
I feel like this was a pass for me, I’m not gonna buy again. Not bad but not good either. But I still would be willing to try the new DE retinol oil. I think people with dryer skin would appreciate this product more than I do (I have oily-normal skin)"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,A-Passioni Retinol Cream,"It has a creamy texture that absorbs quickly, and it worked for me much the way that my other retinoids have worked: reducing hyperpigmentation and acne, and making my pores look smaller and my fine lines less pronounced.

"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,Goes nicely on,I noticed my skin has improved after using. It doesn’t peel and isn’t not strong like if you use the purer retinol in the tube - I can put it on day and night but need to remember put sunscreen if applying during the day 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,sooo worth it,"I have been using this for a while now. There were small break outs for the first few days, but since then my skin has looked amazing! My pores are less visible and my face glows more. I just bought this in the full size."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Must have,"Already running out of my 2-nd tube, will purchase the 3-rd definitely. There is a right way to apply (the frequency - once in a 2-3 days, and burger method- applying a moisturizer before and after), however I mix it with a moisturizer and apply twice or even once in a week. Be careful with other products in your routine, since there are products retinols are not working well with (I exclude any kind of acids for that days and next day). Results: acne control, invisible pores, even texture, less wrinkles, elastic skin. I’d suggest to start to use it before noticing wrinkles or fine lines. I use it in the evening. In the morning my face says me “thank you” ))"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,My skin is in love with this product. There’s an immediate healthy difference in my skin. I also use it with B-Hydra serum. Hands down. I’ve tried many many products and this one wins all the time.  I just don’t want to live my life without it.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,"Like most Drunk Elephant products, this is pricey but worth it. Definitely went through a shedding faze when my face was totally dry and flakey but after the shedding stopped I could definitely see an improvement in my skin."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,"pricey, but definitely saw my texture was smoothed and fine lines were instantly reduced within a few weeks of daily usage (3-4 times a week) lovely smooth texture and goes nicely with any skin type."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Stop Wasting Money,"A waste of money. I have come to the realization Drunk Elephant just has a drunk price. This has done nothing for my skin. It just made me feel good because I put something ""expensive"" on my face but it has not made any difference. I would recommend seeing a dermatologist if you are looking for a retinol cream."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,It's a splurge but it's helped my skin texture-- I use a few drops twice per week and this bottle lasted me a very long time.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,WORKS BUT PRICEY ,actually my skin can handle a lot of actives ingredients just be sure to do your proper skincare and make sure to put moisturizer! it works but the price is so expensive 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,Great clean product !! Acne gone after a couple uses
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,1% Vegan Retinol,"Absolutely love the consistency of the product! I feel as though I am putting a cream on my face, not water. It’s not to heavy either, for the hot and humid southern atmosphere I live in. I applied just as the directions indicated and have had no irritation. I am blond, blue eyed, and as fair as snow. I have a wonderful soft skin glow and for the Read more about review stating Face Fantasticfirst time in my life have gone foundation free! I am addicted to this product. I am definitely worth the investment!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,Strong chemical but it works,I only used this a few times cos I feel that this product is too strong to use. I only use this when I feel that my skin needs a little more TLC. When I feel that my pores is too congested. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Malaysia,Best potent retinol! ,"I love how strong this retinol is, as 1% is the highest percentage of retinol can get over the counter in Malaysia. It is effective and I really enjoy using it. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Expectations exceeded,"This was my first try with a retinol and I wasn't sure what to expect. But I love most DE products-one of the things I love about them is that they sell the minis so I can see how they work for me. This worked unbelievable well on some new lines I was getting-those vertical puppet lines from the corners of my mouth down either side of my chin. Maybe because they were just starting to form, and even if it's just temporary-they are gone after just a few days use. On wrinkles that I've had for a while like my forehead worry lines I haven't noticed the same dramatic difference but I'm willing to keep using it to see if there's more improvement. One pump/pea size is enough for my whole face, it absorbs quickly and doesn't leave any kind of shiny plastic look or film. I didn't have issues with peeling or flakes, my aging oily skin drinks it up. I do use a small bit of B-Hydra™ on top of it, another DE product that really works for me without clogging my pores. I think it's worth trying out any of the minis to see if they work for you. Price-wise based on the small amount I need to use, the mini will last me a long time. I like that I can try, mix and match most DE products without having to pay full price for something that I ends up not working. Definitely going to get the full size when the mini one runs out."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Nope,My skin absolutely hated this. Even once a week application was too much.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,DE,"plant-based ingredient that shows real promise as a more natural, less irritating alternative to usual retinoids"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,love,"so many retinol-spiked creams migrate and irritate my sensitive eyes. This one sunk right into the skin without the redness or prickly sensation — and just like that, it became my new "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,"I been using this for about 8 months and I’m now on my second bottle. I really should have stopped at the second bottle but I know it takes time for your skin to adjust so I assumed I needed to use it consistently before I did. 

I really wanted this for my finelines on my forehead. While, I did see some improvement, It certainly wasn’t what I had expected and a little disappointed. It did do well with forming my skin. I used a different retinol brand before and was so pleased with the outcome that i didn’t think I needed it anymore, even though I know you’re no suppose to. Anyway, I decided to start back again because I had an event that brought back my stress and anxiety and with that came the fine lines. So when using this compared to the other brand, I realized this one was not worth it. I will be chiding choosing another brand after this one."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,I received this product as a sample. I am not usually a fan of drunk elephant products. But this product is alright. I haven't seen any peeling or dry patches on my skin after using. But I don't see any big difference after using it.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,No Improvements - Destroyed Skin Barrier,"After 3 months, I have seen absolutely no improvements - rather I feel like this did the complete opposite and caused my skin to look dry, dull, flaky, red and distressed. It also caused me to break out. Not new to retinol - so I understand it takes some time to get your skin acclimated to a new product and go through a “purging” period with retinol .. I used it once a week at first, then twice a week at most, and even paired it with DE’s B-Hydra serum to mitigate potential drying side effects, and also used their Protini Cream, but after 3 months of using Passioni I’m so done with this. My skin barrier has been destroyed for 3 months, my face feels and looks like a hot mess. I would not recommend Passioni at all, especially at this price point. Going to search for a less potent retinol."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,Weird smell,"For the record, I've only used this twice over 5 days as I needed to conduct some patch tests first, per the literature insert inside the box.  It comes with the light blue B-Hydra™ in the same twin pack, so I assume the B-Hydra™ is paired with A-Passioni™ to calm and hydrate my skin after I've applied the retinol acid over my clean face.  Both products smell like my stationery glue!   Texture-wise, the A-Passioni™ is more gooey than the B-Hydra.  I guess the creator didn't want any fragrance in her vegan products, but the price you have to pay is that customers may be put off by the unpleasant synthetic smells that WILL linger on their face for hours.   As for its efficacy, I can't definitively conclude as yet, but it did give me a mild tingling and prickling feeling on my first application."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,"I’ve been using this product since January and I noticed how smooth my skin is. I definitely experienced purging where my skin was peeling and breaking out even worse than I used to. Now, I get occasional breakouts but they heal a lot faster! I’m still in the process of getting my scars fully healed but I really love the product! I added before and after (no make up & with make up) pics. Trust the process and make sure you focus on using products that heals your moisture barrier!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,"Product is ok, pump is a pain","Retinol Cream did not irritate like others I have tried. Seems to make my skin feel smoother, but after almost finishing the bottle, I haven’t noticed much difference. I would’ve given 4 stars but the packaging really does not work for me, the pump sometimes sticks and not very practical.  Too much plastic, too big a footprint being that it’s only 1oz of product for such huge plastic container."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,This retinol is suit for you if you have a sensitive skin and want to try retinol for the first time. I started with 2 times a week and now I have been use it every other days for 2 months.It works good on my skin but make my face a little dry after. I would recommend to use their new retinol oil since it works better with my dry skin!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,Really wanted to love this one. Didn’t work for me at all. It had no effect - good or bad whatsoever. I have been using it for months
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,so far so good,"So far , I am really enjoying this. First time using a retinol and I noticed my face not as red first thing in the morning which is nice. I had a purge breakout prior to using this. My routine is skin fix acne cleanser + retinol drunk elephant glycolic night serum , and I would say it’s calmed down 
significantly after almost two weeks of using."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,Best retinol! ,"Works, yet gentle on skin. Alright for daily use. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 10ml,"There are much better retinols out there for much less. Didn’t do anything to my skin, won’t be buying again."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Best plant based retinol ever,"This has been a savior for my skin. My mature, sensitive, combo, acne prone skin has faired very well from incorporating yet another fabulous Drunk Elephant product into my routine. I did have to learn the hard way that less is more with this bad girl. But bad girl as in, my pores are less congested, my texture is evening out. My GF complimented me apx 2months after I started this that my skin looked more glowy. I was like, that right there justifies what I spent on this for looking glowy W/OUT wearing bronzer or highlighter!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,not worth the money,Not worth the money imo. I’ve used better retinols. I didn’t really notice a difference in skin texture or anything. And yes retinols take time but I didn’t get anything.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,NOPE!,"I’m 56, but get a lot of “No way!” Am half Asian, half Greek, always taken excellent care of my skin. My beautiful mother taught me at a young age to treat my skin well to maintain a youthful look. (Her Japanese genes didn’t hurt, either). But always looking for a new “HG” product, decided to try DE cream, but it was the reviews that swayed me to try. 6wks in & I’ve seen no results. Nada. Nothing. Nope. I even stepped it up a notch, used it morning and night after cleansing. I feel like I drank the Kool-Aid. Or rather “drunk” it. HAHA
Two stars for spreadability & eco-conscious packaging."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,Great intro to Retinol,"Great retinol for beginners, this did not break me out and leave my skin sensitized. You will not expect to see results with just one bottle in my opinion. Unfortunately the price point is too high to keep repurchasing.  "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,Amazing! This is a must,10/10 amazing. Would recommend to all! Left my skin feeling brand new.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,a staple in my skin care,Best retinol A in my opinion. it does the job of exfoliating but also has a very peneteative moisturizing component. I have acne prone skin and it does not cause breakouts whereas oil retinols have.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,"Simply obsessed! If you are interested in a retinol product, this is the one. Works magic and is good for sensitive skin.  I already bought another for when this one is done. I also love that this is a clean product. Start in small doses and work up to using once a day."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,Good but pricey,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) A cream that seems to be retinol-strong and rich at the same time. It didn't dry my skin out and absorbed well, without leaving any greasy residue. I'm not sure if I'll repurchase or look for a cheaper alternatives."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,minimizes pore and fades dark spots,"this is the only retinol I've tried - and I probably won't try another one. I had the sample size and just ordered this mini one since it lasts a long time! Plus retinol is better when it's ~fresh~.

Best product I've used that clears my hyperpigmentation and leaves me glowy and smooth!!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,I love it! I mix it with b-hydra serum and i love hom my skin reaxts to it

DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,An amazing retinol cream without irritation👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,I hv been using Retin A cream over the years with promising results but my skin is getting more n more sensitive over time. Having to come across this product in Sephora I decided to give it a try. I would say that I’m happy w d result n without any irritation n it’s less oily than d Retin A cream. I would usually applied this after C firma n before my retinol oil fr d same brand. It does redden my skin but d redness will go away in a few minutes. I love how glowing my skin tends to look after using this product. 5 stars awarded👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 10ml,"I think this product does not do anything special . For sure, you can not expect one night result but I’ve been using it for 3 months and nothing specific happen to my redness and hyperpigmentation."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,CHANGED MY SKIN. SO SMOOTH.,"At 28 years old, I have always had issues with texture bumps on my cheeks and jaw. I have tried many different acids and exfoliates, but nothing had worked as well as this. This product is a game changer. I started to see a noticeable results around 2 weeks. However, It has taken about 6 weeks of regular use to get amazing results. I did have to start slow with using 2-3x a week and now I have worked up to 4-5x a week. Also make sure you have a gentle daily cleanser, a good day time spf and moisturizer when using this."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 10ml,"My first ever retinol cream in life. So far so good . I am loving it.

DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 10ml,"This product exceeded my expectations.  I chose to try this as my first retinol product as I read it was a more gentle.  I did need to have a bit of patience as the first week I had the purge with no visible results.  After 2 weeks, however, my skin looked brighter, smoother, and had a glow.  After 4 weeks I saw a dramatic difference in the texture of my skin as well as completely stopped any small breakouts I regularly get.  This is a powerhouse product that does a lot.  I wish I tried this sooner."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,A staple,"This is the only product from DE I still keep buying even tho I dont like the brand, because it works so well and no other retinol i've tried is up to par. I dont have sensitive skin and im used to it so I can use it almost every night with no irritation whatsoever. I apply it 15 min after moisturizer before bed and it works so so well!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,The strongest retinol that I've tried so far. I got this as a sample and feel that it was more effective than the few other retinols that I have tried so I definitely plan on buying this one.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,"No difference, still the same","I don't know if it's working on my skin, I don't see any difference."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Malaysia,"No Burns, Gentle To Skin","This retinol is my first ever purchase. Used this as per instructed. Did not irritate my skin in any way at all. Did not notice a difference in my pimple, whitehead and oil production though. However, I would be glowing in the morning after using this. Definitely continue using this every night when you get to that stage. No regrets purchasing this retinol. Highly recommended!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,in love,This product changed my skin over night. I have acne spots and its crazy how fast it worked for me! I use it twice a week and love it!! Out of my price range but it lasts a long time!!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Best retinol,"When I first started using retinol, this product did make my face tingle for about a week but my skin got used to it. I love this because it’s not greasy or oily and one pump is all I need so this product lasts for a good 8 months."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Not effective,"It’s surprising to me that people are saying this is too strong. I have very sensitive skin and retinols usually lead to redness and irritation, but I had no reaction with this. I used it directly on my skin without sandwiching it and it did absolutely nothing. I don’t know if the product I received is defective or what, but I am skeptical that it has any amount of retinol in it. And it’s overpriced as all of drunk elephants products are. I will definitely be buying a cheaper retinol in the future."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,My favourite retinol so far,"So far I have tried a few brands of retinol, and I feel like the drunk elephant works the best for me so far, likely due to the higher percentage of retinol. I have not used 1% retinol before but this did not cause me any irritation at all. My skin definitely feels smoother and dark spots have gradually been fading after using for the past 1-2 months. Only wish this were a little less expensive."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,too strong for regular use,"Let me preface this by saying I don’t have particularly sensitive skin—I’ve had no problem with even daily use of products like acids or other retinols in the past. However, even after 6 months of trying to get my skin adjusted to this product, I still can only use it once a week without getting EXTREMELY and noticeably flaky, even if I mix/follow it up with a moisturizer. 

I was introduced to this through a deluxe sample back when it was in a tube (I’m not sure if it was just an older and less active sample, if the tube had something to do with the stability of the retinol, or if they changed formulas). In the tube, I used the product ~4 times a week with no issue. I saw some improvement in forehead lines so I bought it myself (now in the pump bottle) and continued use as I had before. My skin got extremely flaky, but I figured I was just adjusting to a “fresh” (and therefore more active) bottle. After 2 or 3 weeks of continued flakiness with no sign of improvement, I scaled back use until settling on once a week only, which I combined with B-hydra to avoid irritation. I’ve been using this product once a week (Sunday nights only) for about 5 months now, so last Thursday I thought I’d probably adjusted enough to use it twice in one week. I was wrong—it has now been 4 days since last use and I’m still extremely flaky to the point it’ll probably take another day or two before I’m back to normal.

I’m giving the product two stars because, even just using once a week, my forehead expression lines and “11” are noticeably softer (although I just turned 28 so they weren’t thaaat deep to begin with). However, I don’t believe this is a product most people can build up to regular use with, or at least not in a reasonable timeframe. And, if only used once a week, I don’t feel like I’m getting as much anti-aging benefit as I would from a lower % product I could use more often. Basically, it’s just not worth the price, and there are other retinols that don’t tear up my skin."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,not irritating,"Smooths my skin and I wake up with baby soft skin. Use a good moisturizer afterwards. Seems more gentle than other retinols ….my skin doesn’t flake
Too bad. Drink elephant is also cool cuz you can mix with
Other drunk elephant products to make a skin cocktail"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,um okay flex!,"Okay game changer. Freaking three uses spread out over a few days and there is already a visible difference in some clogged pores near my hairline that i could not get rid of! I have dry skin and a dry house during the winter so i am taking it very easy just in case, applying it every other night or so. It's great. Smells good, makes me feel good, 5 stars."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,THANK YOU THANK YOU DRUNK ELEPHANT!,"Having been born and raised in the south (born in New Orleans, and then moved to southern Florida) I was always a swimmer, bicyclist and loved the sun!!  Now, however, in my late 60's (ack), my face shows all the past tanning in my face!  Thru the years I've tried numerous facial products with NO effects at all.  Wasted a lot of money.  After trying small size of the retinol Cream and the moisturizer, in the past two months have had EXTRAORDIARY results!!!  Suffice to say, I purchased the large size of the Drunk Elephant retinol cream and their B-complex moisturizer.  I am so happy with the two products, and other folks have commented how gorgeous my skin appears.  Tooo bad I didn't take a ""before"" picture!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,"Great results for my combo, acne prone skin","I got this as a gift and while it is intense, I have seen great results for my moderate acne. I only use it 2x per week (I have combo sensitive skin) with a very thin layer at night on top of a moisturizer and put Aquafor around my eyes, corners of nose and mouth before applying. If you've tried Differin this is much stronger than that, so I would recommend starting slowly and modifying use based on how your skin reacts."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,My new favorite,Amazing stuff and already seeing a noticeable difference in my skin adding this to my skincare routine for sure
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,Always come back to this!,I always come back to this retinol cream. It's great for acne and super great with the waterfall facial cream!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,a little irritating still after 2yrs of using,I really do like this retinol I do but for what ever reason it tends to sting my face after application even more when applying a moisturizer after but then it goes away after 3min one time I woke up it looked like broken capillaries on my checks for a couple days then it went away but the product does go a long way you only need just a dab the smell doesn’t bother me at all either but I just tried the PC and will be sticking to that one.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,so good!!,noticed a difference in less than a week! just make sure to use sunscreen and a good moisturizer!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,If u have sun spots this cream will help u a lot. I been using it for 3 year or so now. Slowly went from once a week to every other day.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Amazing product,I have used other anti-aging products but this one is amazing!! I use it on my forehead about 3 times a week and never have any issues with irritation or sensitivity! Will be purchasing again
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,Once you get past the purging the flaking (which is common for high strength retinol) it works awesome. I use it 5 days a week without issue.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,So impressed,I have extremely sensitive skin but this doesn’t bother my skin. It’s amazing. I use it and literally see results OVER NIGHT!!!ITS WORTH THE MONEY I PROMISE
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,"Love this Retinol! It has helped to minimize wrinkles and to even out my skin tone. Start slow then build
Up to daily use!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,World’s best wart-remover,Got rid of this huge and stubborn wart on my son’s hand without hurting the skin around it. It only took about a week and I am sure I forgot a few times. We put a tiny bit on before bed.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Philippines,For those trying Retinol,"I’ll be using this product after I finish breastfeeding as retinol is not safe during pregnancy and nursing. My skin isn’t used to retinol right now, and I have sensitive skin, so this product will be my way of easing it into my skincare routine. I hope it works well for me, and I love that it comes with a free Drunk elephant B-Hydra Intensive hydration serum!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,Great for hormonal acne,Great for acne prone skin. It is drying so sandwich it if you have super dry skin!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,"Finally they changed the packaging. I used to completely dislike the old packaging, it was horrible. I almost threw the Retinol cream away.. but the cream itself is SO good. It really does help with pigmentation and skin turnover. If you use it very consistently (only at night) and with sunscreen during the day, you WILL see results. I mean it is one of my top retinol products. Now that the packaging is so much better, I can fully stand behind recommending this product. Note: please BE CAREFUL.. if you've never used retinol before, it can cause irritation, including redness, dryness, and peeling. Especially around the sensitive areas of your face such as your eyes or nose creases and what not."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 10ml,"Originally tried a sample bottle a year ago, and it was the first product to clear my skin in over 5 years. Since then I hardly ever get pimples. If I do get a pimple, it never scars or leaves a mark anymore. Skin texture is amazing - no more bumps. I'm sure there's cheaper retinol options but I don't want to stop using something that works so well. Mini bottle lasts me more than 6 months."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,Vegan retinol,"I love this vegan retinol. It does the same job as any other retinol but does not flake my skin as it does with other product. Been a regular retinol user, so I went straight to almost daily usage. I focus on pimple areas and area with common fine lines. It dries almost instantly so I can put on my other face product immediately. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,I'm addicted,"I have been struggling to find a good product that addresses a couple of concerns without creating new ones: lessen breakouts but don't dry me out; reduce texture, don't make my skin more sensitive, lighten dark spots etc. I've been using this product for about two weeks and I already notice a big difference in texture and lessening of breakouts. I would normally expect something this effective to have dried me out and started the breakout cycle all over again but no! I use it with the hydrating serum every night and my skin is clearer and smoother and also looking really hydrated! Can't wait to see results from longer term use."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,This Was Great,"As far as over the counter retinols go, they can be hit or miss. Before I started a prescription tretinoin, I used this and it seemed to actually do a pretty good job! The tube was opaque which is a good sign for a retinol and I did see an improvement in my skin!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,"I wanted to love this product but I had to stop using it. I have acne prone skin. Before using this product, I did not have any flare ups, and my skin was doing great. I was looking into retinols, so I decided to purchase this one. I started once a week, for the first three weeks. I started breaking out. On my fourth week, I started using it twice a week, my break outs continued. I read retinol may purge your skin, it’s been two months. Every time I use this product, I wake up the next day with a pimple. I can’t use this product anymore. Very disappointed, didn’t work for me."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 10ml,"This product did not make a bit of difference on my dark spots. It did, however, diminish the appearance of my forehead wrinkle. The smell is pretty bad too."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,Good,Bought this to try after reading the reviews. I have eczema prone skin but this retinol works fine for me.  Pores appear less visible and skin does not feel too dry after using. Hope to see better redd see ultra in few weeks time. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,"It delivers on what it promises, I don't get any reaction"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 10ml,Bought this after the ordinary retinol did nothing. 4 uses of this was more than the entire ordinary bottle did for me. 2x a week and my face is so clear
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 30ml,Definitely my fav DE elephant product that I’ve tried. It leaves my skin feeling so nice and isn’t irritating. The mini has lasted me four months and counting using it every other night. Hard to say long term effects because retinol takes so long to see results but my skin looks great.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,non irritating for sensitive skin,"I have a very sensitive , eczema prone skin. Also suffering from maskne. This product is gentle, but you can definitely see results in couple of weeks . The skin is smother, pores less visible and overall skin is more glowy. I need less concealer. A staple in my routine now"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream - 10ml,"Disappointed in this product, I have another brand that I love and is less money which I will be going back to."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,Good ,Got this during sale.  One of the best retinol product but a bit drying for my skin if used too frequently. Can see effects the next day. Rmr to use your sunblock 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,Great addition to my nighttime routine,Have only been using for a couple weeks. Great texture and addition to my nighttime routine. I use with the drunk elephant framboos glycolic serum
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,USA,"Tried the sample size, buying the bigger size now","I received a free trial of this product and the tiny sample last me 2 months using it 2 a week. I alternate between using this and using vit C oil (korean brand) at night. Between this two my skin has been very luminous, my dark spots have rally decreased in color and the texture of my skin has improved a ton. The vit c oil I use is a very mild product and I have had no problems using this in my routine. No redness, no peeling. And I have fair, dry skin, with mild rosacea. I never used a retinol before using this sample."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-A-Passioni™ Retinol Skincare Cream,Singapore,miss ,Bought it on a sale without realizing it’s the old product but change in packaging from a squeeze tube. Been using this brand for a while and the retinol is not too drying for skin 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,Australia,Miss,The beauty advisor recommended this product and it is a nice smooth moisturizer worth a try.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.,I agree with a lot of the reviews saying the new formula is not good and sadly will not buy again. I’ve been using and loving this moisturizer for 5 years and the new formula smells and feels different. It makes my skin sting upon applying it and overall doesn’t do the trick like before.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,New Formula Breakout Disaster,"I’ve loved this product for years, but I’ve been using the new formula for a few weeks and it’s breaking me out. I barely go a day or two without a breakout now. I’m sadly looking for a new moisturizer."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream - 60ML,"It made me break out each time. Such a shame since it hydrated me a lot more than my Clinique. It did get me a little oily after a few hours, but not too much."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,New formula :(,I’ve given this product 5 stars before but the new formula is not good :(. I was wondering why it was making my foundation look horrible when it normally looks so nice. Literally have to wash my makeup off and start again
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream - 60ML,"Confidence in a Cream is rich and creamy and manages to instantly moisturize my dry skin. The color and consistency resembles banana pudding. It melts into the skin, is fast absorbing, but does leave a slightly greasy layer on top of my skin. 

Even though I have dry skin, Confidence in a Cream is a little too much for me during daytime especially in the hotter summer month. Instead, I prefer to use it as part of my nighttime routine. 

It is packed with superstar ingredients including some of my favorite ingredients Squalene & Niacinamide, but unfortunately also contains fragrance. The scent is a little too strong and perfumy for my liking but thankfully I don’t have sensitive skin and do not experience any irritation when using fragranced skincare products.  "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,not the same,This was my favorite moisturizer until they reformulated it. It’s not at all worth the price. I feel cheated. I was skeptical when I went to Korea the summer and didn’t see it sold anywhere. I read that it had been sold to L’Oreal. It’s obviously moving away from what it used to be.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream - 60ML,I ran to the reviews to see if it was a new formula. I’m so sad it is. I will not be purchasing this again once I’m finished. This does not go well with make up at all.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Received this product free from Brazil agent so I,I received this product from biz agent ice agreed to use it and I ended up using it for 18 days I have to say I love the way my skin feel nice and tight and it looks so clear my friends noticed it and asked me what’s going on what did you do to your faceI told him about this product in the highway I loved it and it made me look this will be one product in my cabinet
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,not my fav after formula change,This was my go to fav moisturizer. Then they added the “supercharged” aspect of it and it definitely feels different on my skin. Takes forever to sink in and feels sticky on the face.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Not for me.,"To start, the smell reminds me of products my little brother's grandmother used to always use.  I wasn't aware that I had a smell-based memory trigger for her; she wasn't a decent person...so, that wasn't pleasant.  I still tried it for a week, since it was a free product for review program, and I'd have to in order to give an honest review.  It felt pleasant. Not greasy.  But it didn't feel...satisfyingly moisturizing.  Like I still needed to go back to my regular face moisturizer as well (I went one day without doing so) before my skin would feel right...less tight and dry as it does after washing my face. I felt it sink in, but then it still felt  like it was sitting on top of my skin.  Though it didn't leave a residue that my fingers felt much at all.   I didn't want to keep having the smell right in my face, so I stopped using it after a week.  I didn't notice much change in one way or another that was an improvement on the basic face products I regularly use.  So maybe, in my case, it's just not a formulation that is right for my skin, or at this point in my skin's ageing.   
So while it isn't something I'll keep using, I will select positively in the recommend/don't recommend options below.  I've spent a bit looking up reviews and information on several other sites and cosmeceutical reports/research/news sites and, for one, it has review averages similar to those here, all over the place.  Something that overwhelmingly approved of is worth giving a try. Despite my odd-one-out personal feelings and results about it."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,Canada,Change back to the old formula,"Original cream was amazing!!!! The best I’ve used. The new formula is AWFUL - I broke out, my skin overall just doesn’t have the same glow and makeup DOES NOT sit well on top"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Great moisturizer for dry skin,"This moisturizer worked really well for my sensitive skin. It is super hydrating and did not break me out, which is an issue I have had in the past with other products. 

I found that this moisturizer works best for me as a before-bed moisturizer to help keep my skin from drying out overnight.

I would recommend giving this a try if you are looking for something that is very hydrating but doesn’t feel too heavy once it has been applied and been absorbed. I will probably purchase more when I run out."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Pretty Good,"I like the consistency and scent of this cream. I also like that it’s vegan. 
I liked the results I saw with this."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,New Formula is Not Good!,"I have been using Confidence in a Cream for years... but then IT changed the formula and it made my skin break out and cause blemishes! I used to have acne free and blemish free skin until IT changed the formula in their moisturizer. 

IT, please bring back the old formula. Why would you change it? So many people loved the old formula, it was wonderful!

Anyway, I have to return this moisturizer now. It is not doing my skin any good, I do not want to keep having to hide my blemishes with concealer every day (I didn't used to have to wear makeup daily!). I will try out Tatcha's moisturizer."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Change isn’t always good,I was a huge fan of the original formula. This “upgrade” has been causing some dermatitis and breakouts since I bought a new bottle. Going to give it about two weeks of trial in case things settle.  down.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Amazing Confidence in a Cream,"This product is great! I was worried it would be too rich for my skin and that it would cause breakouts, but it was perfect! It didn't feel greasy. I won't use anything else now!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Must have in your skin care routine,I’ve been using this for about month and I LOVE IT! It makes my face feel so soft and look glowy! I love the smell. It’s light but nice. I also use this cream on my dry elbows and it works amazing. It’s helped with the appearance of fine lines. I would definitely give this try.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream - 60ML,"My very first try I felt like the cream was kind of sticky and a little bit thick, compared to other moisturizing creams I've used before. It also leaves your skin a bit oily and takes a while to dry off. This is not a moisturizing cream I would recommend to be used during the summer, as your face will become stickier with hot weather conditions. After a few weeks of usage, I haven't noticed any difference in my skin. It's supposed to help with dark spots and find wrinkles, however I didn't notice such changes on myself. One of my main concerns were the fine wrinkles below my eyes, which after 14 days I didn't see any difference. I was hoping my pores would look better but again, no such a difference. Perhaps this product works on other skin types, since my skin is mostly oily. I would not recommend this moisturizing cream for those with oily skin. It would probably be great for those who have dry skin since it will provide moisture, however it is very thick."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Great addition to my routine,"I kind of love all of the IT cosmetics products I’ve tried in the past and this Confidence in a Cream is no exception! It’s very hydrating, absorbs well and keeps my skin plump. I especially love how it holds up under my foundation. On going I definitely see a difference in my skin and it’s texture. I’ll repurpose and I really want the neck cream too!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Must have in your routine,Nice product my skin feels hydrated and not sticky and heavy. Love the minty smell. Absorbs easy
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,For glowing and smooth skin,"After using this product over the last month, I have noticed my skin has been much more hydrated, fine lines are more smooth, and I wake up with a soft glow. This cream does have a subtle fragrance, almost rose with a touch of citrus, but this did not bother me and I find it pleasant."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Youthful,This gave me a youthful appearance with Regular use. I did not have any visible fine lines and receive many compliments at a recent wedding I attended. You definitely have to use this consistently to see the results. I felt confident just by using the cream and when I saw the results. I would highly recommend.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Reduced the size of my pores!,"I really enjoyed this face cream. While I wasn't a fan of the fragrance (very mature scent), the cream was very moisturizing and left my face feeling super hydrated. The tradeoff is that it does feel a little sticky and heavy on the face, but that's not a huge complaint for me. Before I started using it, I was dealing with some HUGE pores in my t zone. But the way they shrunk after only a couple weeks of use was amazing! So overall I'm definitely pleased with this moisturizer. I'll probably use it more in the cold months."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream,"I have been using this product every day since I received it. As you can see from the photo, my jar is getting low. :) I absolutely love it. I like the feel of the cream when I am applying it. It is slightly cooling and nicely moisturizing without being greasy. The fragrance is pleasant, light, and does not trigger my frequent migraines. I notice a tightening and smoothing effect immediately on my face and neck when using it. I use this as part of my face moisturizer and primer before applying my liquid foundation makeup. I like how it contains NIACINAMIDE, SQUALANE, PEPTIDE-LIPID COMPLEX, COLLOIDAL OATMEAL, and SHEA BUTTER. I like that it is in a jar. IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream is a fantastic product and I recommend it highly."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Creamy hydration,I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I have combo skin  and I am at the age where I’m beginning to have fine lines  and wrinkles. I love how thick and creamy this moisturizer is without feeling ti heavy on my skin.

IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream - 60ML,"I have combination skin type and I think this cream works fine for me. I use it in summer and I don't feel the texture is too heavy. Maybe it's a little too heavy when I use it in the morning, but it really works better during the night time."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Night time routine,Works best at night. Apply just a bit before bed and you’ll notice the difference in a few days. Hydrates really well
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,"Lightweight, Hydrating","I received this product for free in exchange for a review. The product is lightweight and really hydrating, it absorbs pretty fast, but i’m not sure if I see a difference in wrinkles yet. There is niacinamide, squalane, a peptide complex, hyaluronic acid, and ceramides, which suggests that this product should be fairly hydrating and brightening. This product is scented."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Super Hydrating!,"Super hydrating! This cream provided me with a smooth and seamless application,  and it made my skin feel amazing."

IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,SO WET!!!,"I absolutely love the calm smell of this face cream. its not too overwhelming, but its just enough to smell good and simple. I am definitely going to use this until its empty, it is so hydrating which is what i need."

IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,A Multi Tasking Anti-Aging Cream,"I have been using the It Cosmetic ""Confidence in a"" line for several years now so I was excited to try their anti-aging formula! 

This formula addresses multiple signs of aging in a way with excellent ingredients. It combines several ingredients that I apply separately so I love having them in one product!

Niacinimide is a potent ingredient for evening skin tone but it is still gentle unlike Retinol or many Vitamin Cs. Squalene mimics the natural oil of the skin so it keeps my face smooth and hydrated. And the Peptide-Lipid Complex gets to work on fine lines!

It also has Colloidal Oatmeal to soothe the skin.

It has the same light citrus scent as the rest of the line. I tend to pick fragrance-free products but I love this light scent."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Hydrating!,This cream goes on so nice and smooth! It’s not sticky whatsoever which is usually an issue and dries relatively quickly. No residue and no pilling. I haven’t noticed a difference in any fine lines but I will say it definitely hydrates.

I’ve been using this and I like it a lot. It’s moisturizing without being greasy. I wake up and my skin feels hydrated. I do have dry skin and this works so well. 
It doesn’t break me out. Didn’t irritate my skin at all. It does have a light almost citrus scent to me. But nothing too overpowering.

IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,"""It's Gooooood!"" ","I was gifted this product by Bzzagent & It Cosmetics for my honest review. 

Confidence in a Cream Hydrating Moisturizer by IT Cosmetics is a dream cream. With dermatologists & surgeon's alike partnering with IT Cosmetics to formulate clinically tested & cruelty-free products. One can be rest assured lots of special ops went into this bad boy of a moisturizer. 

Packed with spectacular ingredients like Niacinamide, Squalane, & A Peptide-Lipid Complex, this cream is FIRED UP to combat 10 signs of aging. All proven with real life results. The hydration is insane. I used this for several weeks & noticed my skins transformation. Day by day I started seeing improvements in the stubborn lines & wrinkles I had. The tone & bumpy texture smoothed out which was HUGE for me & a relief! My skin felt firm & my face glowed.  The overall quality as a WHOLE of my skin up to this point is why I can confidentially stamp a 100 on this guy & with no hesitation say: ""It's Gooooood!"" "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,"Nice moisturizer, but heavy for summer","So I thought I'd try a new cream as I'm getting older.  I like the smell although I feel like it takes me back to my past a bit, although I can't quite place the smell.  It's pretty thick however, and I have oily skin (maybe at some point it will dry out!), so it seems like it takes forever to set.  It's probably better for someone with less oily skin or someone who doesn't live in Florida."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream - 60ML,"I always struggle finding a good moisturizer cream that hydrates my skin without leaving it greasy because one of my biggest problems is that I break out easily since my skin is oily, a while ago I was gifted with this confidence in a cream bottle to review and even thought I wasn’t sure of trying the cream because of the problem with my skin I gave it a try and my surprise was that I end up love it! Not only leaves my skin hydrated, soft and glowing but also fights 10 signs of aging like texture, elasticity, lines, firmness, neck lines plumpness and more! and is clean & vegan. I have used it for the past 3 weeks and my skin feels so good and looks healthy and brighter! Confidence in a cream is a thicker cream so a little goes a long way and it absorbs really easy. I really recommend Confidence in a cream because is a complete cream for mature skin like mine!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Smells great! Good quality skincare product!,"I was pleasantly surprised by this! I had used IT cosmetics brand products in the past and wasn’t wowed by them after continued use. The smell of this was floral but not over powering. Also, a little product goes a long way. Since quality skincare products can be expensive, I liked that I didn’t need to use a lot of it. It also wasn’t sticky and soaked into my skin right away! I liked it a lot. It was my first time trying an anti-aging type of product."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Wo!,"Love it! The formula is silky and makes my skin glow without being oily. The only thing I don’t like is the slight scent, but my sensitive skin doesn’t mind it. I would highly recommend for aging skin, it’s luxurious!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Smooth Skin,I really love this cream. Makes my skin feel good. I totally recomend it.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,loveeee it,"So I wanted to give this cream a solid month and half of consistent use before having any final thoughts.

 My initial take was while I liked how it feels very creamy and absorbs well (not too greasy) I honestly just didn’t feel much of a difference between this and the original confidence in a cream (which I love). 

After using it consistently for over a month now my thoughts have changed. I truly think this formula has made a bigger difference in helping my skin feel plump and youthful and less oily. I feel like the original while it does similiar for me I still throughout the day would get oily in my t zone and depending on weather dry in other areas but I always chalked it up as my skin type. This formula though has made a big difference for me on my skin type and even for make up application. I absolutely love it and will have this on my normal skin care routine now :)"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Moisturizing,This is very moisturizing! So thick and creamy. It goes on really well and it has a mild scent.

IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream - 60ML,This is a great moisturizing cream. It has a light scent and doesn't feel greasy or heavy on my skin like other anti-aging creams tend to do. Since using this cream my skin looks smoother and my wrinkles less noticable overall. I also like that this cream comes in a glass jar.  I will continue to use Confidence in a Cream because I like the anti-aging effects it has on my skin while still feeling comfortable to use.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Extra extra ...you wanna buy this right now!!!,"Amazing ...

It has made my skin feel moisturized and look hydrated. I would definitely recommend."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Made my face greasy,This moisturizer made my face really greasy and didn’t do a lick of removing any kind of wrinkles. I don’t suggest this product to anyone. It just wasn’t what I thought it would turn out to be like. The moisturizer sits on top of the skin rather than soaking into the skin. It feels so heavy on the face as if you have Vaseline on. I just don’t like that oily feeling on my face. It caused me to break out more and just wasn’t my kind of moisturizer. I have combination skin as well.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream - 60ML,"Confidence In A Cream is my new go to moisturizer. It's a thicker cream, so a little goes a long way. It absorbs fully in about five minutes. I find that my skin is smoother and brighter since I've started using it a few weeks ago. My skin is much more hydrated and calm. The fragrance is nostalgic for me and doesn't cause any breakouts with my sensitive skin. So far, I'm very pleased!"

IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream - 60ML,I got a sample size with my last order. When I first used it I assumed it would make me break our or my face would be so oily at the end of the day because I have combo/oily skin to begin with. Much to my surprise my skin looked and felt fantastic all day. No acne and no extra oily. Pretty expensive for what I’m used to but I now have to have this! Can’t wait to see the results on my fine lines with continued use.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Great Moisturizer,"This moisturizer is so nice on the skin, I had already heard so many great reviews on this product unfortunately I had never tried it. I finally understand why this product is so great, it is extremely moisturizing. It has a scent to it but it did not cause acne on my sensitive skin. This is a product that is worth the money , I would highly recommend! This is definitely for dry skin, I noticed a difference in my skin immediately."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream - 60ML,"I used it Confidence IN A Cream for the last couple of weeks accompanied by a serum.

IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream - 60ML,I am in awe! This is probably the first moisturizer I have ever used that did what it said. My skin has never looked better. I had smile lines around my mouth that were becoming more and more noticeable day-by-day. Those lines aren’t as visible now. My skin has never been softer. I use this moisturizer every morning and will have to buy more. I seriously cannot recommend this moisturizer enough. I’ve used a lot of moisturizers that touted all kinds of benefits but I never saw results. I finally found one that does what it says.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Heaven in a jar!,This cream was heaven sent! I immediately felt my skin feel soft and supple after only a couple days. I like how light it felt and I only needed a little bit power use.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Brings Back the Confidence,i was excited to try this cream as I am a huge fan of IT Cosmetics. I have always used their BB and CC creams so I was intrigued to test out their moisturizer. It definitely does not disappoint. It glides on smooth and absorbs fairly quickly into the skin. It is no greasy at all which is nice. It doesnt feel heavy either when i want to wear it under makeup or before going to bed. I saw an improvement in my fine lines throughout several weeks of use. I would definitely incorporate this into my everyday skin regime!
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Excellent moisturizer,As always I'm so impressed by IT Cosmetics. Confidence in a Cream Moisturizer is one of the best I've ever used. In just a few days I noticed my skin texture was so much better and alot of my fine lines after a few weeks look like they had faded. Love it's ingredients and so happy with the results. Planning to buy it again when it's done
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Great,I really like the consistency of the moisturizer. I’ve seen some improvement in my skin but nothing drastic. It does a great job of moisturizing though.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream - 60ML,I used this product consistently for 2 weeks as a day cream and saw some changes in the overall look and feel of my skin. I am typically combination skin but this really helped replenish hydration and helped my skin look more plump and healthy.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Love more than the old formula,I received this free from bzz agent for my honest review. I fell in love with the new formula.  It cosmetics hut the nail on the head with this one I didn't care for the old formula. It's not to thick and it doesn't have a fragrance. I noticed a drastic difference in 2 weeks I'm a month down an ill continue to buy this cream when it runs out.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Nice and Creamy,"The It Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream has a soft, creamy, moisturizing feel to it just to the touch. Dry skin loves it. I like to think of my skin as combination-ish, leaning more towards dry (I used to be very oily). It can easily be worked in to the skin so that's pretty quick moisturization for the thickness of the cream. My apprehension was on it breaking me out as I've tried other moisturizers that were on the same level of thickness and ended up with issues, but so far so good. I'm a big fan of niacinamide for evening skin tone as it is in some of my current products and have heard squalane is great for skin hydration so we shall see the results over time.  A little goes a long way so it'll last for quite a while. Bring on the anti-aging! Don't skip your neck! Thanks to BzzAgent and It Cosmetics for introducing me to this moisturizer."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,"I don’t usually like IT Cosmetics, but I love this","I got this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I am not a typically IT Cosmetics fan. Their products usually break me out or just aren’t the right fit for my skin. Not this one! It didn’t break me out and made my skin feel smooth and supple. I like it a lot, actually. Medium weight cream, not too light or too heavy. It’s a great moisturizer for any season, I feel. Try it!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,The perfect Anti-Aging Cream!,"I cannot say enough good things about IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream! I have noticed such a difference in my skin tone after just a few weeks of use. This cream is silky and perfect for sensitive skin.  It is easy to apply and leaves my skin hydrated after use. It not only is an anti aging cream, but also helps with fine lines and wrinkles and firmness.  I highly recommend this product!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Confidence in a jar,I’ve really enjoyed trying this confidence cream. Its a nice thicker texture and the smell is subtle. A little goes a long way. At first I thought it made my face feel greasy like other creams I’ve tried but then it soaks right into my skin and gave me a really nice smooth feeling and allowed my makeup to go on flawlessly. I have dark spots on my cheeks and after using the cream for 2 weeks I already notice a difference and the spots have gotten lighter. I also feel like my forehead creases are not as prominent. I would definitely recommend you give it a try.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Perfect hydration for my skin,"This cream is a game changer. I used to use another ""prestige"" brand moisturizer cream which was double the price and never had the results I had with confidence in a cream. I have combination dry skin and was very hard to find a product that wasn't greasy on my skin. Neither one that my skin could absorb so fast but still feel the hydration. Doesn't really have a smell to me which I person like and the mew package has less plastic.
It's really hard to find a Clean and Vegan cream with all the good ingredients that this has. I will definitely recommend this"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Love the texture,"I received the new IT Cosmetics (now supercharged) Anti-aging Confidencein a cream.

The cream works well on my oily skin and I’m glad that it doesn’t cause any breakout. The cream it self it lightweight and it absorbs quickly into the skin providing a soft, smooth effect as well it helps reduce the pores around my cheeks area. What I just don’t like about this cream, it’s the scent, I love fragrance on products but this cream have a scent I just don’t like at all and it does take some times for the scent to go; so if you don’t like scent on creams be aware of it, other than that, I love how this cream works on my skin."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,A treat for the skin,I love this cream! It is a very rich cream and the scent is just perfect.

""IT Cosmetics""
•Confidence In A Cream•

IT Cosmetics is a Leading Beauty Brand started in 2008 that is best known for its Full Coverage Foundations, but the company also sells skincare products. And I must admit they have some amazing skincare products that are developed with plastic surgeons and dermatologists. For instance, they're now Super Charged Confidence In A Cream Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream. Which delivers 7 anti-aging skincare benefits in one step. 

With Anti-Aging Armour Rejuvenating Concentrate, This Hydrating Moisturizer is packed with skin-loving ingredients to help visibly reduce fine lines, minimize pores, smooth, plump, and brighten your skin. This moisturizer is great for all skin types, and it absorbs quickly to help strengthen your skin's natural barrier - the key to healthy, beautiful skin at any age. That's why Confidence In A Cream is one of my all-time favorites. 

This formula is made with a powerful blend of hyaluronic acid, ceramides, peptides, squalane, and antioxidant vitamins, that help function and reinforce the skin barrier and restore the look of a more healthy, fresh, and youthful glow instantly. 

•My thoughts:
I've incorporated this moisturizer into my daily and nightly skincare routine and I like to use it as my new last step. And I must say that IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Cream is now my new anti-aging BFF that has shown my pre-aging combination skin the true affection and love it totally deserved. When applying using upward sweeping motions smooth gently onto the face, neck, decollete, and anywhere else your skin may need moisture and rejuvenation.  Thankfully it only takes a pea size amount to cover my entire face and neck. I also really enjoy the scent of this moisturizer. I will continue using this product in my daily routine. Yes, I highly recommend this product cause you can't go wrong with any of IT Cosmetics!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Light weight moisturizer,Effective moisturizer.Makes my skin radiant and bouncy. Not greasy or sticky.Recommend use immediately in slightly wet face. But the scent is way too strong.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Nice light-medium moisturizer,This is a nice medium-light moisturizer. I would say it's better for normal skin than dry skin. It is better for me in the summer when my skin is not as dry. I prefer a heavier moisturizer. But if you have normal skin type this would be great. It has a nice light scent and didn't irritate my skin at all.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Great Moisturizer for All Skin Types,"I have tried out this moisturizer the past few weeks and absolutely love it!

She’s 62 and it really does make a difference in aging skin. She looks smoother and glowier and healthier everyday when using this cream. She will definitely be a repeat customer.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Awesome Formula Multitasking Cream,"This is a new anti-aging cream from IT Cosmetics that hits a *lot* of good notes for me.  It’s super thick and has a silky texture, it absorbs into my skin after about a minute and layers well under my sunscreen and makeup. 

Ingredients | 
4% NIACINAMIDE: Helps even skin tone & reduce the look of fine lines/wrinkles
2.5% PEPTIDE-LIPID COMPLEX: Helps improve elasticity, firmness & hydration; smooths the look of fine lines
3% SQUALANE: Helps hydrate the skin & reinforce the skin moisture barrier

Results | I’ve been using this for the month following my bachelorette party in Bermuda - so my skin was a bit sun damaged, dry and despite my sunscreen use a touch burnt. The cream really helped with hydrating and healing immediately, and after extended use I noticed an improvement in overall skin texture, fine lines, and plumpness/hydration. 

Takeaway | Perfect multitasking cream for all skin types but especially dry and aging skin. I’d absolutely repurchase this!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Didn't work for me...,"I hate to give skincare products a 1 star because skincare is not a 1 size fits all... Unfortunately this did not work for me, but that doesn't mean it's bad, or wouldn't work for someone else..."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,The Best of the Best in Moisturizers!,"This is more and likely the best moisturizer I have ever tried. I received this product as a free sample and boy was I a lucky gal!  It is so hydrating!!! It goes on so smoothly and it stays all day.  I have been using this product for almost two weeks now and I am already seeing results and I have to say it again, MY SKIN FEELS AND LOOKS GREAT! It is definitely worth the price!"

It has a slight floral scent. It works ok but I like my moisturizer better. I’d recommend it if you want light moisturizing.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Relief after a sunny summer!,"I really like the way this new formula visibly tightens, moisturizes and minimizes the lines in my face and neck. My face looks smoother and firmer after a few weeks. There is a noticeable change in texture and hydration. I like that I can visibly see and feel a positive change in such a short time! It’s a quick simple application process first thing in the morning and again before bedtime.  I recommend it for anyone looking for a younger healthier look."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Key Product In New Skincare Routine!,"This has become a key product in adjusting my skincare routine!  I have recently switched up my routine to start including Retinol.

Many people know that Retinol can be harsh on the skin and may take time to build a tolerance to it. This has become a lifesaver in helping me implement retinol. As a new user, I was using highly concentrated retinol every night, since I didn’t notice any of the warning side effects, but by day four I noticed my skin hurt and became sensitive to the touch. I needed to find an anti aging product that would soothe my skin, that didn’t include retinol or a very minimal amount. So, I started to cycle my retinol nights, using this It Cosmetics moisturizer ontop of my rentinol, then without a retinol product, every other night.

It has been a life saver in soothing my skin from harsh skincare products, but also delivering anti-aging benefits as well with Ceramides, Peptides, and Hyaluronic Acid.

My skin literally feels plump under the surface, diminishing obvious lines and creating a more youthful look. I absolutely love this as my retinol partner.

About my skin: I have combination skin, don’t suffer from acne (aside one pimple here or there, and don’t generally have strong reactions to products. 

Drawbacks: This product does have a small fragrance smell to it, almost like lavender. The only thing I would recommend changing is the added fragrance. Fragrance in skincare items can cause side effects like extra sensitivity, breakouts, and even counteract the soothing benefits. Let’s normalize no fragrance, even if it’s from “essential oils”!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence in a Cream™ Transforming Moisturizing Super Cream,USA,Lightweight and makes my skin feel so soft,"I felt like this cream moisturized my dry skin without making it feel greasy. It was lightweight and wasn't a heavy cream which is great. Left my skin feeling soft as can be. It is a little pricey, but alittle goes a long way.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Australia,Miss,"Before trying this product I think I was using l'oreal moisturizer and I decided to try a new moisturizer that is fragrance free.

It feels nice and smooth and easily absorbed."

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Australia,nice but pricey,"I really like this as my night time moisturizer, but I've found the same effects with cheaper options so that's the only reason for it losing one star"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,Burns!,Something in this burns my face. I cannot use this.

Very nice product and a change up from Kiehl's which is my normal go to .
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN.,"NOT FOR ACNE PRONE SENSITIVE SKIN. For my people with sensitive skin this is not it, I broke out the FIRST day, it must be because of the Niacinamide, ordinary Niacinamide did the same to my skin."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,A winner!,"Nice, light texture. Sinks into the skin without feeling greasy. It's very hydrating and it does feel like it plumps and firms the skin. Minimal fragrance. I'll be re-ordering this!"

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,My daily ans favorite moisturizer,"I have been using this moisturizer for a while now and I will continue to do so for a very long time. I have dry sensitive skin and this formula makes my skin feel so hydrated and glowy. I have tried many different, and much more expensive brands, but this one is still my favorite and go to."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,"This cream is extremely hydrating as soon as you put it on. It’s not too thick or sticky, it is just the right consistency. If you’re looking for a hydrating cream that also has collagen and firming effects, this one is for you!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Excellent mosturizer use it along with the cleanser
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,"It smells like stinky plastic mixed with chemicals, and the texture is really chunky, and it’s difficult to blend into my skin."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,The ingredients are good but when I slide my finger on my skin it creates this weird flaky stuff that falls off. You need to be quick to put sunscreen on after this product or it’ll all be rubbed off.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,breakout after one use,"Broke out after one use. I’m hunting for cruelty free moisturizers for mature skin and the reviews seemed to point to this jar. Sadly, it’s on its way back."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,"Great stuff. I use it daily.  I feel less wrinkles in my neck area, when I use it."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Australia,Ms,"A bit greasy for me, although if doesn’t feel greasy when you apply it, it becomes sticky after. I gave it go because I needed a moisturiser and most reviews were positive. I guess it just doesn’t work for me"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,Great cream,"Love the way it feels. Not greasy, my skin absorbs it well and my skin doesnt feel dry at all. My makeup goes on so well after putting on the lotion."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,New Zealand,unsure,I'm still unsure if this product is working. I'm not so sure about this brand. moisturizer is good but feel I could get better you know. I'm still unsure if this product is working. I'm not so sure about this brand. moisturizer is good but feel I could get better you knoow
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Picked this up because I like the First Aid line and it had “firming” in the name :) I use this on my neck and chest and it improves the look of my skin. I’m not sure that it’s helped correct anything but my sun damaged neck and chest looks firmer and healthier when I use it. There have been days I skipped this step and I always regret it.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Love this! Just bought it for the 3rd time. My skin is glowing. It has all the ingredients you need in a moisturizer. It’s helped my skin brighten as well. Would recommend to anyone looking for a glowy/dewy finish.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Bought this after I was recommended by a friend and I use it all the time now.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Malaysia,ms,love this so much collagen in 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,I love all of First Aid Beauty products and the fact that this one has niacinimide is a bonus.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,great product!,very lightweight on the skin and leaves my skin feeling very hydrated!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,utterly disappointed.,"This had been my go-to moisturizer since it hit the shelves over a year ago. However, I noticed that the consistency of the new jar I recently got was different… felt greasier and didn’t really sink into my skin like it used to. I thought it was the temperature change (even though it was the perfect year round moisturizer for my combo skin) but after looking at the ingredient list realized they changed the formula. Looks like they cheapened the quality: lowered amount of peptides and ceramides, and increased amount of fillers and preservatives such as xanthan gum and phenoxyethanol. Why the unnecessary reformulation for a product with rave reviews, while keeping the same price point? Epitome of corporate greed I tell ya."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,Better than expected!,I was very skeptical to buy at first but I am glad I did. I looked up the entire site for a good moisturizer. Bought many but didn't like any. Finally settled on this 1 and I am glad I did. It's soo good with whipped light texture and good moisturizing properties. Recommended!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,I have been using this product since the first day i purchased.   Its OK but its not firming as stated and its over priced.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,"I'm really enjoying this moisturizer. It's not too heavy or light. It's perfect for evening or when you wake up with a little bit of dry skin. Overall, I really enjoy and recommend as someone with combo, acne prone skin."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,Not for me,Unfortunately this cream made my skin feel even more dry. It’s very frustrating because I can’t seem to find a good moisturizer. Hopefully others have a much better experience.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Very hydrating and calming cream. Love to use it day and night.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,I’d give it 10 stars if I could,"OKAY I normally cycle through moisturizers. I’m always trying out new products and I rarely ever will buy a full sized product after testing a sample. 

I loved the sample size so much I bought the full sized one and I can’t rave about it enough. I have really sensitive skin that is often dry from using retinol plus very reactive. Im picky about a moisturizer. The texture of this is so perfect it’s fluffy but also rich. And an added bonus is that it is unscented! I love the way this hydrates i love it sooooo much"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,A moisturizer that can do more,"A moisturizer that can do more than just moisture your skin? This will be. Not only moisture your skin, but it also a great support for improving skin texture and blurring the acne. Absolutely fall in love with this. Blending in so perfectly."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Australia,Breaks me out ,I am obsessed with the FAB Hydra Firm night cream so I thought I’d love this too but unfortunately it breaks me out and causes redness on my cheeks. I wish I could use it because it seems like a great product.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,SO GOOD,I have wicked dry skin and usually i am a BareMinerals Butter Drench only girl but my mom bought me this and I LOVE IT. It is very light but wow does it hydrate. Usually I have to reapply towards the end of the day (mid afternoon) because my skin feels tight but not with Butter Drench and now THIS!! No second application for me!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,Supple and Hydrated!,"A step up from the ultra repair cream. I don't love having to stick my finger in the jar. Leaves the skin supple, juicy, and hydrated. A pea-size does the job but sometimes when taking the product out with your finger you can take out more and can't put it back. Of course, I just use it up on my body or as a second layer but still a little inconvenient. If you can get a little scoop for it, do it lol."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Australia,My Holy Grail,"I may be speaking too soon but I think I've found my Holy grail moisturiser. I have dry skin, but don't enjoy super rich formulations. This moisturiser somehow manages to be rich and light at the same time. I love the whipped texture. Upon first application I literally said outloud, 'ooo that's nice'. It just sunk into my skin and felt so nourishing. I'll see how I feel at the end of the pot but I feel like this is my new staple for the cooler months. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,Light but hydrating!,It’s a really light cream. Kinda like whipped butter? It doesn’t feel heavy but is just as hydrating. I love it! My new favourite moisturizer for sure.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,great cream,I love this cream. Feels amazing and makes my skin look great.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,Favorite Cream,My skin sensitive skin was starting to look dull postpartum. I treated myself to this collagen cream and it is now a staple in my skin care regiment. It has smoothed my fine lines and dark circles. Even made my skin a bit more bright and hydrated. Definitely worth the investment!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,My skin already loves this. It leaves my face feeling so soft and moisturized for hours after applying. Doesn’t feel greasy afterwards. I’m glad I added this to my skin care routine.. I was worried with some of the other reviews.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,love love love,This is amazing! I will definitely be buying more ..I’ve been using for a week and already see and feel a difference in my skin! It goes on so smooth and keeps my skin hydrated completely! You need to add this to your skincare regimen!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,I’ve only been using this for a week or so but the product feels nice when applied and is unscented. I’ve been using at my nighttime moisturizer.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,It’s just your average moisturizer. I’ve been using for months and I’m nearing the end of the jar without any noticeable difference in my skin.  There are far better options out there. It did not cause any skin breakouts.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Have purchased this multiple times over again. Leaves the skin very hydrated and soft.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,I didn’t think I was gonna like this at first but I started using it every day and I found my face was starting to get a lot more defined and just looked a lot cleaner I’m only young but I started using this for my dark under eyes and fine lines and they started to disappear after just about a week using!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,Forehead saver,I had been using this for a year and stopped using for a month just because I was getting lazy with my night time routine. Within a month of stopping my forehead looked like crepe paper and super wrinkly. You don’t realize how much a product helps until you stop using it!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Singapore,ms ,Good! Got it during member sales. Cream is thick so will be good to use at night. It’s moisturizing and face feels tighter after the night. Is quite a big tub and will last for months 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,Stinky,"This moisture stinks. Not to mean it’s not good (although I haven’t been using it long enough to say one way or another). I mean… it actually smells bad. It’s smells like chemicals or something. I feel like I need to wash my face after I put it on because the smell will not go away. I’m just sitting here smelling my face. 

Additionally, the texture is strange. It’s not easy to pick up with your fingers.. you almost have to scoop it up or else it slides right off. 

I love the FAB face wash, but watch out for this moisturizer."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,"Made me break out all over my forehead, was really disappointing"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Singapore,Perfection ,"great amount for price. only need a little at a time. I've noticed my skin feels more hydrated. 
I've had a few compliments on my skin even when not wearing make-up. 
will definitely buy again and look at other products from this company. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,#1 Holy Grail Moisturizer,"YES!!!!! The absolute all-in-one BEST nighttime face moisturizer. Anti-acne, antioxidants, brightening, barrier protection, ceramides, fatty lipids, niacinamide AND soothing?!?! COME ON! Look no further. A definite Holy Grail. Feels like putting on light whipped silk. Does not cause breakouts on my oily combo 40 yr old skin."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,Wanted to love…,"But at first application, I had a burning feeling :( Really sad it didn’t work as the ingredients seem good. Now using the Skinfix Barrier+ with no problems!
I chose yes as to recommend because I feel like if your skin doesn’t react to it, this could be a good product."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,"So I finally bought this after waiting bc it’s so expensive. I’ve used it a few times and can already see a difference in my fine lines. Idk what is in this magic, but it was worth every penny. I’m over 40 and have super dry skin anyways. My shin even FEELS different and hydrated. Great stuff!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,delivers beyond its promise,"Life changing. Like all FAB products I’ve used, it delivers. When I wake up in the morning my skin is supple, glows and the slight wrinkles I was developing are no longer visible. Scars are faded and it’s a magical treatment all around for healthy skin."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,Love this stuff!,"Been using this for a couple of weeks now and my skin seems firmer, ultra-soft, and moisturized."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,This is a meh,This for me was just “okay”. The constancy is strange…very chunky and watery. It also does not absorb well into my skin. I have to work this on for a few minutes before my skin doesn’t look white. Maybe it’s just my skin. Maybe this is different for other people...but I won’t be purchasing again.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Australia,Moisturising but not hydrating enough,"I do not find this cream thick or heavy. The texture is non-greasy or sticky. Absorbs beautifully into my skin. However, I do think it is not hydrating enough to use during wintertime. Remember to add a hydration serum if you are using it during winter (if you are normal to dry skin types). "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,WOW,"Was really suspicious at first, didn’t think it would do much but I’d say within 3 weeks of applying it every night I see a HUGE difference! My lines aren’t as obvious as well as the complexion of my neck looks amazing, my skin tone looks even for once! I can’t wait to continue using this product to see the full results."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,Will forever re-purchase!,"My favourite daytime moisturizer to wear under my makeup. I'm very insecure about faint 11 lines forming between my forehead. But, when I wear this moisturizer with The Ordinary's Matrixyl, my forehead is noticeably plumper and smoother. This moisturizer will forever be a re-buy for me! 
Note: I have sensitive, acne prone skin"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,FAB brings it home for Tretinoin users!,"I absolutely love this cream, it's a must in my daily routine alongside the Ultra Repair Cream to compensate for the dryness that comes with my regular use of Tretinoin. I used to struggle a lot with flaking and extreme sensitivity even with spacing out my use of Tret and using ceramide heavy creams, but since using this I almost never do anymore. It helps maintain my moisture barrier and sinks into a natural-satin finish on me (perfect for applying foundation over!) and doesn't contribute to oiliness around my nose where I can get greasy at times.

It's certainly not for oily-types so I'd caution them against this unless using it as a night cream, but for those with dry and/or dehydrated skin, it's been game-changing for me. My skin looks and feels plump and healthy, it's always soft, and despite being pricey up-front, you use so little at a time that the tub lasts forever. FAB kills it for the dry skinned among us."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,"Too much niacinamide, absorbs weirdly, burns","This is a decent moisturizer. It's not great but it's not horrible. I disagree with everyone saying it feels lightweight because it's actually a thicker and more occlusive cream. It absorbs very fast around my dry patches and leaves an oily sheen everywhere else. I'd caution sensitive skin against it. I personally have combination skin that gets very dry and sensitive in the winter. My skin is also reactive to high doses of niacinamide. This product burns my skin upon initial application and has been breaking my out. The breakouts are very similar to what I get with The Ordinary's Niacinamide serum so I'm guessing this product also has a high concentration of it. That being said, it moisturizes and would probably work better for less reactive or sensitive skin. It's missed too many marks for me. 

TLDR: absorbs fast in dry paces and slowly on normal skin. Too much niacinamide and causes breakouts. Burns on contact with sensitive skin."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Australia,Ms,"I am in the 40ish age demographic, and was looking for something to put over my serum that tightens - I mean stings, This face cream is excellent.   I am going to buy it again."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,Beware if you have extremely sensitive skin!,"I usually never write reviews but I decided to leave one for this product. I purchased this about a day ago and I’m already breaking out. Since I have sensitive skin, it immediately gave me tiny bumps all over my cheeks. I will say I do love how much moisture it gives my face! It also leaves my skin glowing. I just wish it wasn’t so harsh on my skin. It may work for others with less sensitive skin! Nonetheless, I will have to return this product."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,I absolutely LOVE this product. I’ve been using it for 3 months and it has given such radiance to my skin. My skin is so supple and soft. Amazing product with amazing ingredients!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Singapore,Does its job! ,I’m a big fan of the original ultra repair cream and have bought it dozens of times. I decided to get this or address some ‘sagging’ skin around the décolletage area and it does it’s job in healing the skin’s moisture barrier while helping to firm and gentle lift areas.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Malaysia,Caused acne,"Thick coming out of the tub but spreads okay omce it warms on fingers. Feels nice on my skin, almost veil-like, but gave me pimples which either increased in number or size with each application. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,Moisture isn’t great,"I haven’t finished the jar but it really isn’t providing any moisture. It does make my skin very soft in the morning, but I need to layer another water based cream over this just to feel like my skin is getting moisturized. It is winter and my skin is dryer during this time, so I’m going to finish the jar, but I’d pick something else if you’re looking for something really hydrating."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,Not for combination skin.,"Not for combination skin. Made my face so oily and created small breakout, and I’ve never had acne."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,Moist but still have dark spots,Very moisturizing but have not noticed a difference with dark spots.  I use as a night cream and do not use daily so maybe just need to use more consistently.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,Moisturizing??,Love the ingredients like Niacinamide and collagen but its not very moisturizing here in Thunder Bays winters
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,I’ve only been using this product for 5 days and I’m really noticing a difference. My skin looks younger and soft. It burns a bit when first applying especially after a toner but that quickly fades away and I’m left with smooth healthy looking skin
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Australia,For my husband ,"Bought it for my husband. Something went wrong because I found the product still sitting inside his drawer and about 20% used. 
Eventually he repurchased his old product and never use this anymore."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"I wanted to try a new moisturizer and picked this one and I’m so happy I did! I was having issues with dehydrated looking skin, and from the first time I applied this, my face is SO SMOOTH and feels so soft and hydrated. I love it!!!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,Great moisturizer,I don’t know if it helps with the wrinkles but it is by far the best face cream I’ve had. It’s light and it moisturizers perfectly. It absorbs quickly. And I love how it’s not scented.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,G.O.A.T from a skincare junkie,"Feels like light as air cloud like whipped cream, but dries like a blanket of protection… you can feel it work & plump and seal. Unlike anything i’ve used & it truly delivers. Collagen us a great hydrator, but it also has peptides, niacinamide, and ceramides & so much more and beyond everything you need in a solid moisturizer."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,This has been great for my dry sensitive skin. I use twice a day.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,"it's not a bad moisturizer and i love most of the ingredients, but i really hate when brands put diamond dust and stuff to make your skin look more luminous 'cause it's only temporary and washes off. so you don't actually know if your glowing complexion is because of results from the work your doing or just diamond powder. i wish they would take it out. also, maybe i'm just super dry in the winter, but it's not that thick and dries down kinda matte. feels like a mask on your face."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,"If you mind the burn, you may have to return","I've purchase this product and I have to admit, It does what it claims. However, I do not have sensitive skin but it did slightly burn across both of jaw lines. I am not fan of creams that burn unless it's purpose is to exfoliate. Although I've enjoyed the results of my skin, I just wasn't a fan of tingling so prevent rashes, bumps or any form of irritation, I've just decided to return it. It did brightening my skin, the hydration was minimal, and it's pretty light weight. You do receive quite a bite of product for the price and the ingredients are lovely. I am just not sure what ingredient is contribute to the tingling/ burning sensation?"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,"This is a really fantastic moisturizer. I find it is rich but not greasy. I originally received a sample of it and my skin loved it immediately. Had to purchase a full size, and have repurchased since!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,I have combination (more on the dry side) sensitive skin and I really like this cream. It's super moisturizing with a ton of great ingredients. Love it!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,"great moisturizer, but heavy for me.","Tried this out for 4 months and while I found it hydrated my skin, it was heavy for daytime use as I have combination skin.  I switched it to my night cream after serums and my skin looks great. I had switched up my routine so I can’t say this was due to this freak alone but I had radiant glowing skin even through the seasonal change to winter. 
4 stars because the packaging really doesn’t hold up and I couldn’t layer it in the AM."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,I bought this thinking okay let’s see if works it shouldn’t harm my skin since it says safe for sensitive skin. Unfortunately it burned my skin around my cheeks and chin. I had to return.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Didn’t hate it but only gave it 2 stars because I didn’t notice any improvements in my skin. It was nice to use at night when my face was dry.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,Great all around moisturizer,"This moisturizer is perfect for my combo skin.  It’s lightweight and absorbs nicely.  It pairs with serums really well.  I wake up with glowing skin.  I love this cream, it does so well."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,Product ok,"After I have cleansed, toned, and put serum on, I layered my face with this cream. It feels amazing when I put it on, but was sadly disappointed when I woke up. I am not sure if my face was dry enough that it absorbed all the added moisture, but my face was somewhat dry in the morning, especially around the chin and forehead area. I have used about 6 or 7 times now, and all with the same results. I was hoping to wake up to hydrated skin. A little disappointed, I won't repurchase."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,"I have really dry skin, in winter it’s terrible. Love using this at night super hydrating. Makes my skin feel a little plump even. I have a hard time finding any moisturizer that plays well with my makeup and if I choose to use this product over my typical daytime it does the trick."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Australia,Amazing for dry skin,"I’m the type of person who has very oily skin yet can get very dry at the same time without the correct moisturiser, and this product is my absolute favourite I’ve come across! I will never stop re purchasing, I just wish it came in a bigger tub!
"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,Severe breakouts,I wanted to love this product but it made me break out really badly and I don’t get break outs or acne ever. It did moisturize my skin and it felt hydrated but i’m only going to use it on my neck in the future.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,USA,Must Have,".. this is an amazing facial cream. I already noticing major differences in the wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes... and actually my smile lines too after using about 3 weeks.
The cream is not sticky or tacky... and it does not cause breakouts on my very sensitive skin. 
Another great product from FAB."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,"This stuff is incredible. If you have textured or congested skin, you need to try this."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,New Zealand,it’s nice…,"I find I reach for this on nights when I want some soothing. This isn’t a luxe formula but it is gentle, particularly if I have over exfoliated.  I sometimes need to layer it with two layers as it soaks in really well but needs a little more at times "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Malaysia,this is amazing,This is amazing product I haven’t try it . I gonna get this one and yeahhh this is super cute and can help my flacky skin !! Girls try this out guys. I really in love but it’s too pricey 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,Love it!!,"I love this cream! I've been using it for 4 months now and I've noticed a big difference, even early on after only a couple weeks. I'm 21 years old and wanted to try this since, although I don't have wrinkles yet, I found that I didn't have very bouncy skin. I felt like my smile lines would sink in a lot. This keeps skin looking plump and doesn't leave skin too sticky or dewy after. I started using it on my under-eyes too after reading that it was good for dark circles and I quickly noticed an improvement."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Firming Collagen Cream,Love this product! Been using it for 4 months and my skin is glowing
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Great Product for my Aging Skin!,"I have combination skin that's leaning more towards the dry side as I get older, and I still suffer from consistent breakouts-ugh. Being a first time ""Drunk Elephant"" product user, I really wasn't sure what to expect. I have to say that I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer and it feels so nourishing and lovely when I apply it. I currently only use it at night, but it's light enough for me to use in the morning, as well. I will definitely continue purchasing this moisturizer and will be looking into more ""Drunk Elephant"" products!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,Good moisturizer ,Good moisturizer for dehydrated skin.  Skin stays moisturised for 12 hours.  Not greasy or sticky after application.  Absorption is quite fast too.  Thumbs up
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,"I have been using the product for a few weeks now, I have seen a slight difference in my skin barrier, marks have started to fade and my skin looks healthier in general"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Firm skin and a bouncy hydrated feel,"Great moisturizer. I would say not so much for super dry skin because of the gel consistency. BUT if ur not looking for a super creamy moisturizer, this is your girl. Super firming and noticeable difference in skin. 10/10"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,Good to use before makeup,"the cream is light, I choose to use it during daytime before make up. i Love the Dispenser design most, it can keep the cream proper sealed during use."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Not worth it.,Does nothing. Waste of money. Not thick or moisturizing enough for my dry skin. I also dislike the container or dispenser.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,"Amazing, finally something that works for me","I recently started using this with the protini serum. I cannot believe the difference in my skin. I never cracked the code to the perfect skin care formula for my skin, which is very oily with uneven texture. I took the plunge and made the investment into drunk elephant and I am so glad that I did. My skin is noticeably softer, firmer, clear, and the oil is the most in control than it’s ever been. I highly recommend these products. I want the entire line."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,best moisturizer ,"This moisturizer does its job well without any irritation, breakouts.  It does not make my skin look too greasy too.  It’s great for sensitive skin. My whole family use this. Love using this before makeup."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,"Nothing special, too expensive.","Nothing special, too expensive. For this price, I would expect some improvement. But after finishing the product, I don't see any changes. It's a smooth cream and absorbs well, but that's all there is to it."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,Awesome! I use it only as my night cream as I find it a bit too thick for under my makeup. Only need one pump to cover whole face. My face is definitely plumper and tighter after using for a while.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,must buy!,"In my opinion, this is the best product in the drunk elephant line. It provides the best hydration for my sensitive-combo skin and it doesn’t make my skin feel oily. Have purchased several times! "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Doesn't moisturize all day,"Maybe for acne prone oily skin this would be fine, but for wrinkle prevention no way. It's moisturizing for even an hour."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Nothing special,"Nothing special, just feels like a moisturizer and didn't change my skin much. A bit heavy for my taste but good if you like that as opposed to a lightweight moisturizer."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Made my dry skin breakout,No scent. Very rich in texture. Oil-like feeling on the face after applying. I have very dry skin but this moisturizer made me breakout. I strongly suggest that you try it out first before committing. I personally did not see any benefits from using it for 1 month.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,The first time I put this cream on it was I love my skin feels hydrated plus with my night smoothie routine my face has been looking very healthy I also use it at night ❤️
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,This is a staple!,"This moisturizer is everything! Disappointed in myself for having taken so long to purchase. Combination, acne-prone skin approved…"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Works great with the Protini Serum!,Didn’t like this cream the first time I used it but after I tried it with the Protini Powerpeptide Resurf Serum that it’s paired with in the set I loved it. Definitely works best as part of the Drunk Elephant skincare routine
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Love,I love her! I’m super oily so I only put the tiniest bit on my forehead to prevent shine. I slather it on my cheeks and chin and it’s helped my skin.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Hydrating!,Saw more hydrated skin within first time using it. Feels amazing on my skin and lasts long. Good for normal/dry skin in my opinion
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,Best moisturizer,One pump of this is enough for my face and neck! This is so easy to apply and so moisturizing! Love love love it!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,"Glazed doughnut, anyone?","This makes a great light moisturizer for the summer. I also like the smell, it reminds me of a glazed doughnut. My face be smelling like a glazed doughnut"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Not worth the money,"I really liked this moisturizer the first few days, but didn’t see much of a difference as I kept using it. If anything, my skin started to look dull after switching moisturizers. I have normal skin and I felt like this wasn’t moisturizing enough. Not saying it’s terrible, just feel as if you can find something much better at a lower price."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,"Terrible! Caused a horrible, painful breakout","I wanted to love this, it felt nice going onto my skin - but OMG after a few days of use I ended up with the most painful, deep, under the skin breakout. All over my entire face, cheeks/chin/forehead. I'm not usually someone with sensitive skin - but wow. Do not recommend."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,great for sensitive skin,It does have sone sooyhing effect and moisture my skin. It make my skin appear brighter in the morning. I don't use it in morning because it have sticky texture. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,My skin has grown to love it!,"My skin has grown to love this cream! I bought it after my boyfriend recommended it to me, more like raves about it to me. So I knew I had to get it. Didn’t really see the hype with first application but ever since applying it, I noticed my skin getting more plump and softer. It’s now a part of my daily routine and helps my skin from drying because of the niacinamide in my routine. Must have!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,great moisturiser ,"This moisturiser is great for drier skin and is easy for the skin to absorb. Although it is pricey, I feel that it’s worth the money. Would recommend "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,I’ve only used it a couple times so far but it’s been a game changer in my skin care! My skin doesn’t feel dried out and so smooth! Can’t wait to keep using.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,yes sir!,"already noticing firmer skin, tighter along jawline. more even tone.
will update further after a month!
if this cream keeps this up it will be my hg."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,"Love love love, pretty pricey",I’m pretty obsessed with peptide moisturizers/creams. This is one of my favorites. If it had a better price point I would repurchase. Down one star for this reason
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,not so sure!,"i like it but I dont know if I love it , so far I didn’t see any obvious result ! but I will keep using it !
i also bought same brand face serum , i use them together!
 "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,Made my skin feel great but at this price point it just isn’t special enough.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,love it nice and smooth I don't care about the $$$,amazing moisturizer I have combo dry skin is not heavy on my face
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Wish it was cheaper,I have the value size and I still wish it had more product! This baby is expensive but worth it if you like spending $$$ on good skin. I sure do.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Lovely,"I love this cream. Light enough for combination skin. I use it in the mornings and evening as well. My only issue with DE so far is the OVERPACKAGING. It is very disappointing, I hope they do something about that in the future."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,My favorite moisturizer!,I have tried a few others but keep coming back and loving the results. I have combination/oily skin and I love this stuff.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,"This has a lovely texture, especially for a daytime moisturizer. However, something in this gave me the worst breakout I’ve had since I was a teenager. My skin loves the Lala Retro cream, but this one not so much. I’m not sure which ingredient made my skin go wild, but I would not purchase again. I can see how it would work well for someone who doesn’t have a sensitivity to the ingredients. I really wanted to love this."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,can’t quit you,"By far my favorite skincare product. Once you use this moisturizer, you’ll never want to go back. It’s pricey, but very high quality. It absorbs well and doesn’t leave your skin feeling greasy or undernourished."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,It's meh,This cream was really nice the first few times but as I continued using it it wasn’t enough at all. It has a nice texture and no fragrance but it just wasn’t moisturizing enough for my dry skin. It is a nice cream but nothing phenomenal. I don't think it's worth the price.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,Ever since first receiving a free sample of this moisturizer I have been obsessed! It keeps my skin nice and moisturized throughout the day without being suffocating or too thick when I first apply it.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,love it ,"Must be my 5th bottle or something. Loved it ever since I tried a sample. It’s moisturising but not too heavy on the skin, suitable for even Singapore’s hot and humid weather! "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,I keep coming back to this product!,"I think I am on my 8th bottle. I love this stuff! I tried other products from time to time, to see if I can find something cheaper, but I keep coming back to this product. It's moisturizing, improves my texture and let's my makeup apply beautifully. I definitely recommend for anyone needing a great hydrating moisturizer that's not too thick and not too heavy."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Not worth it,"This product is way too heavy for my skin, I found that my face was very oily when using this product. I stopped using this moisturizer and switched to another one and my acne instantly started clearing up. Even if this product worked for my skin, it is very over priced and over rated. Do not recommend."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,yay!,This 100ml package was out of stock for a while and I’m glad it’s been restocked! Best value buy! Been using protini for a few years now and I simply don’t want to head out without this moisturizer on my face! I’ve oily skin and it’s abit heavy when applied singly so I mix it with other products from Drunk Elephant.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,Love it it’s really moisturizing and it’s not heavy at all I mix it with b hydra serum and tlc framboos glycolic night serum
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,nice product,bought the mini one. it’s a gel formula and i wasn’t expecting that. it’s quite hydrating and moisturizing.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Different than i expected but good,"this product is a lot more if a gel formula than i expected, but it is still really good! It is quite hydrating and moisturizing and a nice consistency."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,"This is a nice moisturizer. I like the way if feels on my skin, however, not sure of the ""firming"" effects. I haven't noticed anything."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,I love this moisturizer! It works pretty well and doesn't feel very moisturizing but it actually lasts a long time and is really strengthening. The price tag is just a little too much for me and I think there are dupes that could replicate this.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Love,"My skin is so clear and the texture has improved so much since using this moisturizer! It was more than I typically spend on a moisturizer but, it was absolutely worth it. Will be trying out other drunk elephant products in future!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,Protini Polypeptide Cream,"I've been using The Protini for the last 2 months, and I love it. It absorbs quickly, effectively moisturizes, and doesn't irritate my sensitive combination skin."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,amazing moisturizer!,"I have been using this cream for 4 months and my skin has never been better. It is so lightweight but also deeply nourishing and firming, making it perfect for all skin types. My skin was inflamed recently because of perioral dermatitis, and I applied this cream to the irritated area. After a couple or minutes, the redness and irritation ceased. If I could give this product more stars I would."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,"Such a great daily moisturizer. Absorbs well, is lightweight but can be layered. DE can do no wrong IMO"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,on my second large tub,"I’m on my second large tub of this stuff. The consistency what I look for in face cream- it is thick enough to not feel too wet and oily, but thin enough that it is easy to spread over my face and neck. It’s very mild for me, and soothing when I apply. I don’t wear any makeup and this does not leave me shiny."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,"The moisturizer is very nice, but not worth it for the price in my opinion. I found it took a long time to absorb into a combination skin compared to my first aid beauty coconut water cream. It is too expensive for the quality in my opinion"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Not great at all,Nothing special..cause little bumps to appear on face and chest..pricey item that caused issues
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,didn’t make a big diff for me ,"pleasant to use but didn’t make a diff to my complexion - it’s pretty mild and not so moisturising hence very well suited to singapore
i use it to mix in vitamin c and other serums from drunk elephant since the jar is easy to pump - good packaging "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,I love the texture and it is effective ,"I like the light texture, yet it is moisturising enough for my dry skin and suitable for Singapore humid weather.   
I pair it with 2 serums and it works well. Package is very hygienic and will not cause oxidation. However on the other hand, I wouldn’t know how much left in the bottle. 
"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,"Awesome cream, use it almost every night. Tends to be more on the low absorption side, but if you use a small amount it's fairly fine."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,"It's for sure a 1""",Wow wow wow!! i am in love with drunk elephants moisturizer! it makes my skin so so so even and incredibly smooth! i heavily recommend it's definitely worth your money!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,very moisturising! ,"Super hydrating moisturiser. Pairs well with the other serums that I have as well. Like the bottle as well, it only pumps what I need without oxidizing the rest of the product. However it is slightly expensive.. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Perfect,"I feel like I've spent years 29-31 trying to find the greenest, best products for sensitive skin, with as few irritants as possible, and I come back to DE, but then I convince myself that this new company might offer something better. No more. I'm firmly convinced that in this price range DE is absolutely the best for my particular skin type. I wish DE used glass or recycled its caps. If they did that I would be less inclined to keep trying some of the newer brands with glass packaging that simply lack the perfected formulations that DE offers. Sigh. Protini is the perfect moisturizer. Blend it with the Framboos glycolic a few nights a week. Use sunscreen over it during day. Add in a serum for some extra fun. Boom. Perfect easy routine."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,GOOD but not GREAT,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this as a sample just recently. I will say the texture of this moisturizer is great, it feels very creamy and luxurious. It does absorb fast as well, which I appreciate. It didn’t leave my face feeling extra soft and smooth, but it does get the job done. I didn’t feel that this was worth the hype, the Fresh Youth Preserve and the Tula 24/7 samples I received were both miles better. Not bad by any means, its a good product with no fragrance. Just doesn’t feel like a 5 star moisturizer."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,NOT non comedogenic. NOT for sensitive skin.,I think they changed their formula. I've used this product in the past and I liked it but this second time around it's making me break out bad. I thought I was crazy and then I see on the reviews it's made someone else break out in the same way I'm breaking out. This product is NOT non comedogenic. Need to return this asap.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Malaysia,love it,I love this cream. decided to buy the full size after using the sample size. the texture is not oily. but it takes awhile for the cream to be absorbed. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Amazing Product,I think this product is amazing. It is by far the best moisturizer I have used. The price is unbeatable for a drunk elephant item. This leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft I will definitely be repurchasing
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,broke me out,Broke me out unfortunately. Used it for a whole month and this was the only thing that was changed.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,This moisturizer won over a huge skeptic,"I've read a lot of really critical reviews online about DE and how a lot of their products can be perceived as being overpriced, though I have to say that this really won me over. There are a lot of ""okay"" moisturizers out there that get the job done, but since I've started using this at night (might be a bit too heavy during for combo skin) my skin has felt so soft and hydrated. The fine lines on my forehead also don't seem to be as prominent after a couple weeks of use. It is quite expensive (but the 100ml limited edition is a great deal) though I would say if you have a few extra dollars to spend on skin care then this is definitely a worthy purchase."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,This is the most nourishing and moisturizing cream ever ! My skin is so dry and this keeps it so hydrated and refreshed ! Definitely worth the price compress to other expensive products
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Great for Oily and Dry Skin,"I have been using this moisturizer for months. I have dry skin, and this is the only moisturizer I have tried that I can see working for both people with oily or dry skin. It is so deeply moisturizing instantly, but unlike many other moisturizers like that, this moisture stays. I wake up in the morning and my skin is plump and refreshed. If I want extra moisture or if my skin barrier is compromised, I throw on some type of ceramide based moisturizer to really lock in that moisture."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,just the best dang moisturizer ever,Amazing moisturizer- feels so nice and soothing on. Has good stuff but even more importantly is missing all the bad stuff like fragrances and irritants. Even if my skin is over-sensitized I can use this moisturizer without any stinging or burning and I’ve had great results from it. The container is awesome at keeping the product fresh and protected. Only drawback is the price- it’s expensive and I’d love to use more but don’t feel like I can because of how pricy it is. I’m not sure why drunk elephant or a competing brand can’t create a very similar product for a fraction of the price because so much that’s good about is due to what it doesn’t have like perfumes and irritating chemicals.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,Was told this was good for combination skin. Completely disagree unless you want your face to feel tacky and sticky. 100% do NOT recommend get the Lala Whipped drunk elephant instead. It’s thicker but leaves your face smooth and not feeling like laffy taffy!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,"I started using this cream two months ago and I really like it so far. I usually break out a lot during summer time whenever I use a cream based moisturizer. Ever since I started using this cream, I could notice that my skin got so much better and the small oily bumps are gone on my upper cheeks (below the eyes). The texture is perfect, I would say it’s a mix of a gel and a cream. The only downside is the packaging!!! I bought the biggest format and unfortunately the pump doesn’t work all the time especially when the moisturizer is at the bottom of the jar. I recently dropped it on my sink and the entire lid came off, now I can’t even put it back in place."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,"Gave this and the serum a try for 2 months… nothing good was accomplished, i only had breakouts. Not worth your money!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,"This cream is really nothing special. I would not buy it again. It’s literally like any other lotion.
It claims to do all sorts of great things for your skin but I finished a jar with no results. I also know this would definitely not be moisturizing enough for the colder months. I’m not sure what the hype is about, it sort of reminds me of the neutragena hydro boost cream (which is actually better than this one IMO)"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,fine lines = gone!,"Another expensive product worth the price! I had fine lines on my forehead and under my eyes and this stuff reduced them in what it seems like over night. I have very sensitive skin so I recommend only using this at night to start. Also, because it has peptides in the formula, be careful using it with other acids to start."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,Definitely worth the price. Been using it for 3 years now after getting a free sample. It has saved my skin. I use it as part of my nightly routine.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Don’t recommend for summer heat- but moisturizing,Very moisturizing and kept my skin from being dry and cakey with makeup but was uncomfortable and heavy when i was in the heat and i felt like it was “melting” but it would be good on a colder day (especially with dry skin) or if your staying inside - good for really dry skin
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,This feels really nice on the skin and I love the gel texture also has that cooling sensation
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,My favorite,I like how it makes my skin feel. It feels smooth. I've been using this for about 2 years. I like that it has a a pump. I haven't had issues with the pump. The only thing I don't like is that it's hard to tell when I'm almost empty because you can't open the jar.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Canada,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) definitely saw a difference in my skin, amazing ingredient list and is perfect for dryer climates and change of season."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,Great for under eye and make up base,I’ve been using this for several months and it’s my go to make up base and under eye cream. Does not feel heavy on my combi dry skin but great hydration throughout the day. Best day cream for hot humid weather in Singapore. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Acne-prone warning,"If you have acne-prone skin do. not. use. this. product. My skin was looking clear and lovely, a little on the dry side, so I decided to dabble in this product for the peptides. Got a sample size and used it for 3-4 days as a night-time moisturizer. The amount that I'm breaking out right now with no other changes in my skincare routine is craaaaaazy. All over my chin, a little on my cheeks and forehead. Like how. Why? I'm sure its great for some people but if you have sensitive skin, save yourself the money and the trouble."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,love it,My holy grail AM and PM moisturizer. It will always be part of my skincare rotation.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,It makes a difference,"I must admit, I’m generally of the belief that moisturizers are all basically the same. I use tretinoin, I use SPF, and those are the heavy hitters that are proven to make a difference, so really any old moisturizer should be fine, as long as it doesn’t irritate your skin. So over the last year or so I’ve been using drug store moisturizers over my prescription tret at night.  

But I looked at a picture of myself a year ago and I realized my skin looked better then. Smoother, less red, plumper. I had to think about what the difference was, and realized I was using DE protini over my tretinoin a year ago.  

I saw this value size and thought, ok here goes, let’s try it again. Expecting nothing. But a week in and I can already see the difference. My skin loves this stuff. It drinks it up. And I’m already starting to look like I did a year ago - smoother, less blotchy, and well hydrated."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,polypeptide,Love the moisturiser. Easy to apply and it makes my face smooth and supple. Best use with Protini serum. Love the combination of these 2 products. Highly recommended 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,Staple.,"Pricey, but worth it imo. Each tub has lasted about 5-6 months with nightly use. Visible difference between when I include it in my routine and when I don’t; really plumps the skin and helps diminish fine lines. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,This is my third re purchase. I wanted a light weight moisturizer and this is the one. It absorbs fast and goes well over serums.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,the only crazy thing is the price,"What’s the hype about? This is a run of the mill moisturizer. Unimpressed, especially for the price."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Good But Small,"It’s a great product, but it’s such a small amount you get for the money.  For me its just not worth it."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,repeated purchase ,"repeated purchase for this product, absorbs well and doesnt feel sticky on skin, can feel that skin is more moisturized in the morning, pricey will definitely get during sale again"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,nice but not for summer,A lovely moisturizer but not for the summer. Far too heavy in humidity. It felt like my skin was melting off in the heat and it took a while to penetrate.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Decent,"I have nothing against this product, but this product hasn’t done anything special for me either. Yes, I find it (decently) hydrating, but it’s not as hydrating as I’d hope for the price. I like the pump dispenser, as it makes it easier to get the right amount of cream. I personally wouldn’t buy this for myself again."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Best Moisturizer Ever,"This is my favorite moisturizer right now! It’s super great to put on after washing your face before bed because it helps lock in the moisture and keep my face soft overnight, I can’t recommend it enough"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,good for combination skin ,Love the texture. It’s gel and it absorbs into the skin quickly. Skin feels moisturized and plump after use but doesn’t leave me overly oily for the rest of the day. I use it with just a toner in the day and with a serum in the night and it’s great for both day and night. Great for my combination skin. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Best moisturizer I've ever used.,"I bought this sort of fearing that I would fall in love with it and would have to continue buying it and unfortunately, this has become essential for me (I say unfortunately because it's expensive haha). But it's truly the best moisturizer I've used. It makes my complexion so soft and smooth, and I swear my skin wakes up looking more even and less red after having it on overnight. I even feel like it's helped with my acne—maybe just because it's more gentle than other moisturizers. I have an oily forehead with a really dry chin, jawline, and nose, and this moisturizer does wonders on the oily and the dry sections. To me, it's 100% worth the hype and worth the money. If I'm gonna choose one area of my skincare routine to splurge on, it's gonna be this."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,Great for moisturising!,"With the help of B-Hydra, it moisturises and hydrates my skin. It helps my dry skin so much that this is already by 3rd time purchasing it. I just love DE so much! "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Protini™ Polypeptide Cream - 50ml,My go to every day moisturizer I have a dry combo scam. Where is great under make up and really helped with the plumpness of my skin.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Love it!!,"My favorite go-to cream for day and night. Unsure I could live without it, wish it was larger but feels amazing, hydrates, and keeps skin feeling plump."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,Singapore,not bad,I feel like this luxuriously moisturises your skin and locks in the moisture as well. It is fragrance free so the texture and smell does remind me of Vaseline… which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Love the dispensing system which keeps things sanitary and neat
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Protini™ Polypeptide Cream,USA,Moving on from this,This moisturizer isn't bad but it isn't holy grail either. It is INSANELY overpriced for what seems to be a mid-tier moisturizer. I used this for several months wanting to love it because I paid so much for it but it didn't do anything special. It moisturized my face but I've had other moisturizers that did way more for way less money. Not to mention that this moisturizer would give me tiny pimples from time to time. I would pass on this one if you have acne-prone skin or very flaky dry skin.

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Moisturizer,USA,Love the natural ingredients + refillable package,"The temperature dipped low enough for the rich creams to come out, and I’m starting with Kora Organics turmeric glow moisturizer.

The outer jar is refillable with drop-in inserts to cut down on plastic waste."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Moisturizer,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Turmeric Glow Moisturizer - 50ml,"Very good moisturizer.

This is an absolute must have!!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Moisturizer,USA,Like it but don’t love it,"The packaging is gorgeous and I love that the key ingredient in this moisturizer is Turmeric. I have grown up seeing my mom add turmeric powder to homemade masks because of its many benefits.

Love the idea of the refillable pods and it has a beautiful earthy smell!"

It absorbs quickly and the ingredients in this moisturizer definitely have left my skin brighter and more even but it doesn't quite give my skin the hydration it needs. This may work better for my very dry skin in the summer months when there's more humidity, but in these cooler months I need more. It does have a fragrance but after a minute or so it becomes unnoticeable."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Moisturizer,USA,My skin feels and looks amazing!,"I love this moisturizer from Kora Organics!! It has a creamy, lightweight texture that feels soothing when I apply it. It has a light turmeric and herbal scent that smells amazing. The scent does fade after sometime.

I haven't noticed my dark spots fading yet, but hopefully I will with more use. It has my skin looking plumper and gives it a radiant glow. I love how hydrated my skin feels too.

I love Kora for what it stands for and how minimal and easy it is to incorporate this into a daily routine whether it be morning, night or both! I suffer from dullness and uneven texture from not always exfoliating or simply taking the time to care for my skin. I love how light and airy this moisturizer is almost has a whipped feeling to it. It immediately is absorbed into my skin. I only use a small pea size, a tiny bit goes a long way! My skin looks so radiant and has a beautiful almost golden glow to it!

To refill the capsule simply just need to twist and remove and install it. This moisturizer has the scent of turmeric. It has a thick cream texture, not too hard to spread out. It takes some time to absorb. I took out the 2 peas size and it's enough for the whole face. It's very hydrating and I can feel a shield formed on my face. (a little sticky) I have dry sensitive skin. I personally think that it's a little too thick and it's good to use in winter.

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Moisturizer,USA,Thick and brightening,"The packaging is stunning as usual! I feel like that is something the brand is known for. Also this has an earthy smell like their other products. It may be a turn off to some, but it’s very faint and aim sensitive to smells and it doesn’t bother me at all. This is a very thick cream-great for dry skinned gals like myself. It feels a tiny bit greasy but It soaks in eventually. I think it makes a great night cream!"

I wish that I had different skin type so I can use it every day and leaves your face feeling so smooth, hydrated and glowing. It is a yellow tint, but it doesn't stain. I do feel like it might be a product more beneficial for someone that has dry skin compared to mine which is all the dryer combination so I have to make sure I don't use too much on my t zone. Other than that the packaging is super cute. I love that you can buy refills. Highly recommend."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Moisturizer,USA,Great,I love this product. Kora organic s truly makes amazing products and also love that I can buy refills. I have very dry skin and I truly love it. It makes my skin look truly amazing!! I think you will enjoy it

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Moisturizer,USA,Lux Texture,"The texture is super rich and a little goes a long way. I warm it up in my hands to prep the consistency for application.  It feels very luxurious on application and leaves my skin looking hydrated, especially my forehead, which tends to always run dry. Even though it has a yellow tint from the tumeric, I never have any yellow staining on my sheets. This is a pm moisturizer for me and occasionally daytime, if I don’t plan on wearing makeup. I have sensitive skin, that runs on the dry side, but if your skin is on the oily side, I would say use this very sparingly."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Moisturizer,USA,Very luxurious!,Wow this is literally luxury in a cup. From the beautiful packaging to sustainable pods you can’t deny it! First of all the moisturizer is really silky smooth on my skin. I felt the tumeric really helped with overall radiance of my face and really sinked in. My skin didn’t feel sticky and I didn’t break out.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Moisturizer,USA,Extra hydrating!,"Everything about this is very luxurious. The packaging and the product feel like an experience. This gives my skin a nice, plump appearance especially around my mouth. Its so very hydrating too. The scent is fresh and smells clean to me. Feels very lightweight even though it’s so moisturizing. Not the best for travel as the jar is a bit cumbersome but other than that I love it."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Moisturizer,USA,A MUST MOISTURIZER YEAR-ROUND!!,"This is such a dreamy moisturizer that’s multi-beneficial. It’s nourishing, hydrating, and provides glow. It’s thick so best to warm it up first with fingers or rub it against palms first for a smoother application. It feels deeply hydrating but not heavy or greasy. I appreciate that it’s clean and certified organic and the ingredients are amazing - turmeric extract, licorice extract, marine micro algae, and rosehip & maracuja oil. 

I love using this with their noni oil for the ultimate spa-glow. This is an incredible combo to maintain hydration and glow during the colder months."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Singapore,ms,"Definitely a good product but too heavy for my skin.  Also price wise a bit steep.  But love the texture and skin looks plumper and hydrated - unfortunately a bit too rich for my sensitive skin 
"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Singapore,HOLYGRAIL,"I absolutely love love this product, and I’d probably die if I can’t get a hold of this anymore. Repurchased for the 4th time already. The best moisturiser for anyone who wants to look like they have a skin of a baby and pretty much the healthiest and bright looking skin! Plus points is, the 50g tub really goes a long way. "
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Malaysia,love it!,I enjoyed using this after i tried a sample size. Since then i’ve bought this big size twice. Kept my skin moisturize without being too greasy. I have dry skin and thankfully my dry patches are not that obvious anymore! 
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Malaysia,Not my CEO,"I’ll start with the good things. Smells wonderful in a natural way. Citrusy but subtle. Goes away very quickly after application. Thick cream. I bought it for a night cream. First time using it, used too much. Took waaay too long to absorb. I got smarter & used less. Absorb well.

Effect wise - I have to say I was not as impressed as I thought I’d be. Judging from the raving reviews that is. I think the Citrus C Nudeskin moisturiser gives me the glow I want. 

This one, not much. It does hydrate the skin. It’s nice. Feels luxurious when applying, nice packaging. At this point of time, I may not repurchase since it’s pretty expensive and results seems so so. 

I bought this because I love Pink Drink by Sunday Riley. This is a nice to have cream but not a Must Have. "
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Singapore,Sunday Riley ,Sunday Riley C . E . O vitamin C rich hydration cream is a power pack house ! it is a deep moisturizing cream that leaves a layer of sheen on my face. more suitable for night cream 
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Malaysia,Not for me,"It's just too oily on my skin, and the color seems a bit off when I first got it. Like the formulation seperates somehow?? IDK how to explain. It's not exactly cheap either, so I used it on my knee and elbow in order not to waste. :("
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Malaysia,Love it!,"A friend recommended this cream so I thought I would try it. Love the citrusy smell. It is hydrating, even when I wake up in the morning my face still feels hydrated. I believe it does do what it claims to do. Now I am onto my second tub and its part of my night time routine."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Malaysia,power cream,"i love sunday riley brand! pricey but worth it! this vitamin c serum is so great with good smell..fastly absorbed into the skin..hence important to me! worth buy! 
"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Malaysia,very moisturising ,"It gives you an instant moisture for your skin especially if you're having a dr skin. And  in one jar goes along way. It lasted for over six months so I would recommend this to people with acne marks, yet having a dry type of skin "
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Malaysia,a very heavy moisturiser ,I love this product a lot. I used it on my face when I was pregnant and couldn’t use any harsh chemicals on my face. It really kept my face hydrated while fading any dark spots or pigmentation on my face. I really love it. I’m still using it till today
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Singapore,it’s ok,"Not crazy about this cream to be honest. It’s a bit too heavy/oily for my skin. Tried it because everyone was going crazy about it, but probably it’s just not for me."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Singapore,so so,"got a sample from last purchased on sephora, decided to get a full size now, but only use few week somehow dunno why my skin looks abit not as good as the first time when using the sample. so throw away although are expensive and left 80% still."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Malaysia,ms,The smell is very strong. If you’re a fan of citrus smell then this is for you. Used it for a week or two. Couldn’t really see any effect on my face. Maybe should use it with the serum. Will not repurchase this product. 
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Malaysia,Good Product ,Bought it for my mum. It is her second one bottle. This moisturiser really does hydrate the skin and it is not sticky. Mum uses it as a night cream and is happy with it.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Singapore,worth to try,"i don't know this brand until beauty advisor in sephora recommend this one. i've been using it for the past few months. i like the smell, so refreshing. and it does hydrate and brighten my face."

SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Malaysia,Hands down on of my favs,Been using this for the past few months daily and the results are amazing. It brightens and gives you an amazing glow and it smells gorgeous. Definitely recommend.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Malaysia,Day and night cream,"I have pretty dry skin and use Sunday Riley’s CEO Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream for both day and night. There are other thicker creams out there but many with strong smells which I dislike, so much so that I usually tend to go with creams that have zero fragrance. This cream however has a mild smell which I find comforting, a bit citrusy but not too strong or candy-like. "
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Malaysia,Fresh and fruity,This is first time I'm trying it and I like this cream . it's quite heavy on my skin so I used to apply during evenings coz I feel comfortable to apply it when I'm at home. It gives a radiant look on my skin after a week of using it. And will repurchase
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Singapore,Overrated,"This was a big dud for me - more so considering how expensive it is! It feels sticky when you apply it and my face looks like it's been dunked in a barrel of grease! And it's not absorbed by the skin even after a couple of hours! Maybe this will be suitable for those who have super dry skin and live in a cold climate. Definitely not for the tropics! Considering the price point, I don't want to waste it and have been using it 3-4 times a week - and I would have really liked it if in spite of how it felt on my skin, it actually did what it claimed...but doesn't deliver what it claims either. Overall, a waste of money."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Singapore,So far so good ,My skin type is oily and sensitive and so far this cream is working well on my skin and doesn't cause any breakouts. It absorbs well and does not leave behind any sticky residue. Usually I will avoid face cream but this is one I will continue using it! 
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Singapore,Favourite Face Cream of all time! ,"I absolutely love this cream, it lasts for a good 3 months and just gives the skin a much needed boost. My skin is clear and gets its daily dose of Vit C. I couldn't live without this cream."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Malaysia,Smells good,"This product leave my skin glowing. Im using this with ceo glow for my morning routine. But i would suggest apply only small amount on your skin bcs the texture is really heavy, if too much it leaves my skin very greasy"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Malaysia,best purchase,Love this. Not oily easily absorbed to my skin. I have combination skin. Been using this for a month now and still loving it. I do not experience any breakout or purging after using it
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Singapore,oily acne prone skin,"It’s really perfect to include in night time skincare routine. I started using from the sample set and I like it. So I bought the large bottle to use in my daily skincare 
"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Malaysia,Rich Texture,"Liking the rich texture. Use it in the evening which i find it a bit heavy but it’s well absorbed into the skin by morning. Though it’s rich, I don’t get breakout from it."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Malaysia,Believe the hype!,"I didn’t know that I needed this product until Sephora sent me a tester sachet. The effect was astounding. I went from a dry, dehydrated skin, to a well rehydrated, plumb and glowing skin (I’m in my 50’s). The Body Shop floor assistant even commented positively on my skin. I can’t sing enough praises of this product (I’m on my 3rd jar), and highly recommend this product. ps. I use it on my neck as well."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Singapore,Skin reviver,"I reckon the product holds up best in cooler temperatures, as mine arrived leaking orange oil. On first use it applies smoothly and tingles gently (if like me you have sensitive skin). It imparts an overall radiance without harsh ingredients; I shall have to see if I’ll repurchase after finishing my current jar."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Malaysia,Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,"Works well with my extra dry skin. Smells fresh, like oranges - a little goes a long way. I see improvements on my dark spots and old scars even without the serum."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Singapore,C.E.O. Vitamin C,"Been using this product for a year now and have no regrets or not even thinking of a change. Texture of skin has gotten a lot more smoother,softer and glowing. Love this product,highly recommended!"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream,Singapore,Sunday Riley vitamin C,Love this product. Everything from the packaging to the product itself bring me joy. The texture is rich and the smell is nice. My skin become brighter and glowing after I use it just a few times a week. It’s my second pack already! 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,Singapore,Moisturiser,Love this. Texture is like whipped cream and love how the product is being dispensed. A little pricey though.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,Singapore,Really whipped cream ,I have always like the packaging of Drunk Elephant products. This moisturizer is super creamy which is more suitable for dry skin or those staying in the harsh climate.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,Canada,it's a pass for me,"This cream is very thick and heavy, if you have SUPER dry skin this may work for you but this moisturizer felt too heavy and isn't sink it, it just sat on opt of my skin and did nothing for it, even when I woke up it still felt great on my face, plus its way to overpriced."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,i love it,such a nice and thick moisturizer!! it made a huge difference in my skin!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,Canada,"Would give 5 stars, but…","I’ve been using this moisturizer for just under a week and I really like it! It’s hydrating, makes my skin glowy and smooth, and hasn’t caused any irritation for my super duper sensitive skin! It plays well with my minimal makeup routine, and I like the way it dispenses. A little bit goes a long way, Which is great considering the price! The only reason why I didn’t give it 5 stars is because of the SMELL of the product lol. I’m super sensitive to funky smells, and this smells really… musty. It’s unfortunate to have that smell right under my nose lol but it wears off after a while."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,Singapore,Incredibly Hydrating,"I first tried out the sample size of this cream as I was concerned that it might be too heavy and occlusive for the hot weather here. It is indeed a thicker cream but it does not at all feel heavy or greasy on the skin during the daytime. I have dry skin and this cream keeps my skin feeling very hydrated for hours on end. It plays well under makeup - absolutely no pilling. And, it gives a lovely glow to the skin. I've also observed that my skin is slowly getting smoother over time. Needless to say, I've invested in the full size and feel it is well worth it. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,Canada,Amazing product!,"This moisturizer is perfect for people who get dry skin in the winter. It is quite rich and very moisturizing, i like that it’s unscented and a little goes a long way. The price is high, although i think it’s worth a splurge"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,Canada,Winter holy grail,Winter holy grail ! Thick and moisturizing yet easily absorbed
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,Canada,Great for Dry Times,"I absolutely must have this moisturizer at all times, and I've always had one since Drunk Elephant only had a small handful of products back in 2017. I must be on my 4th or 5th jar now. I use this on days I feel dry, and it just does the job. Flaking, using retinol, or using AHA or BHA, just use this on top, and your face will no longer be dry. I use it more in the winter than summer, but I would use it before going to sleep on dry, summer days. A friend of mine said it stings when she uses this, but It hasn't stung at all for me. I love how it is unscented, too, and the packaging. I don't like open jars, since I feel like the ingredients get too much exposure to the air, but this jar is a pump jar! I can't live without this unless I live in a humid, tropical climate. Highly recommend."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,Singapore,it’s okay,"This product is good but not awesome. I guess it does what it says which is to protect your skin barrier, but in terms of hydrating, i’d prefer going with the Protini Polypeptide Cream. I give it a 4 star because of its non-harmful ingredients inside and i love how it is fragrance-free"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,"Very consistent over the years! Effective, very moisturizing but perhaps less useful during dry winters."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,Malaysia,Thick cream,The cream is actually pretty thick in consistency. I usually use this at night. Bought it after trying out the free samples. And thought that it will pair well with the Retinol range.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Love it! Especially cold from my skincare fridge,I received this product in exchange for my honest review! I love it! Super thick and moisturizing. Makes my skin smooth and helps my makeup go on flawlessly!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,I liked this moisturizer. It was thicker than my typical moisturizer and was really helpful at clearing up a dry patch.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,"This product is very moisturizing, and the best part is a little goes a long way! You barely need anything to cover your whole face/neck. The downside is the scent (or lack there of). I don’t need a scent for my products, though it’s nice to have, but this had sort of a clay-ish scent by default which was odd."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,I love unique whipped texture of this moisturizer! It feels extremely nourishing but not too heavy. It takes a while for my oily skin to fully absorb this cream but it doesn’t feel greasy at all. I use it as a part of my PM routine and wake up to plumped and rejuvenated skin in the morning.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,"This is an amazing moisturizer it is very thick and a little bit definitely goes a long way. After using it, it always makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated. It also makes my skin glow which I love. I received the sample size complimentary from  Influenster and I wish it would have been a bigger size so I would have gotten an even better idea of how this product works with my skin as I have very sensitive skin. However, I did not like the smell of this product it almost smelled like play-doh and wish it would have been a different scent."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Perfect staple,I love how lightweight this moisturizer is and it’s very comfortable on sensitive combination skin. I highly recommend.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,I love the way this produce makes my skin look and feel!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Amazing,"This moisturizer was a pleasant surprise! It is a thick, creamy whipped texture yet goes on feeling so thin and lightweight!

DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,This has been great for my sensitive and combination skin. Left my skin very moisturized throughout the night and i noticed a difference within my skin after a month’s time. A bit pricey for the size but worth it.

DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,An okay moisturizer,"I received this product as a gift for my honest review. This lotion was nice, but not that exciting. It had a medium watery texture & left my face a bit sticky for awhile. Truly it just felt like it did nothing. No tingling or fresh feeling. No hydration or dryness. No my favorite product."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Very moisterizing!!,"This is definitely more of a night time moisturizer because it is a little thick but my skin is very moisturized in the morning and helps with any dry spots I may have! Although it is a little heavy, it settles in pretty quickly and is not greasy which I really like as well! I just which it was a little bit cheaper."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,"This moisturizer was very hydrating, and it left my skin feeling supple.

I get dry patches on my skin occasionally so after using this, it really helped hydrate my skin and bring it back to life! I also like that it’s Unscented so I don’t have a clash of scents when I layer my skin care products."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Decent face cream,"I received  this product from Influenster for my honest opinion. After using it the past few weeks I am pleased with it but not overwhelmed.  It is a bit pricey.  It is more of a night cream in my opinion because it is thick.  Would I purchase it again? Probably not. However if you like the ingredient list, look for unscented products then this could be for you!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,A winter must have!,I received this item for free in exchange for my honest feedback. I have fairly dry skin and this was a great moisturizer! I loved how thick and creamy it was and that it never felt greasy on my face. I feel like this would be the perfect moisturizer for the winter months when my skin is more prone to dryness.

I don’t use it everyday but it’s super rich and moisturizing- I love the texture and it leaves my skin feeling super soft and hydrated. Highly recommend!!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Decent moisture but…,"I received Drunk Elephant Layla Retro Whipped Moisturizer with Ceramides complimentary from Influenster to review. I thought it was good as a night cream but a bit too heavy for daily under makeup moisturizer. I like that’s it’s vegan but in my opinion, it’s  a bit too pricy."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Meh,"After using this product for a couple week I have found my skin to be more hydrated. However, I feel it doesn’t absorb the greatest? My face felt sticky which I didn’t enjoy. There isn’t really a smell so it didn’t smell bad, the packaging was cute.

I received this product for free for product testing purposes"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Interesting,"This is now the FOURTH time I have tried to post a review because I guess someone with Sephora is choosing to not allow my reviews through. Anyway, the DE LaLa Retro was a no-go for me. In fact, all the DE products break me out. A"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Solid not special,"This is a nice, thick moisturizer from Drunk Elephant. In my opinion, it is her used at night as it doesn’t have SPF and feels noticeable on the skin. I like that it isn’t scented was hoping for more from Drunk Elephant."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Not worth the cost.,This was a thick moisturizer that left my skin feeling greasy. I found it extremely thick and it was hard to spread on evenly and took a while to fully absorb. I was not a fan of the scent as it was a bit overbearing. I would not have bought this myself as it is very pricey for what it is. I received this product as a free sample to give my honest opinion of.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,it’s….fine,"it’s….fine. can you find something better cheaper? yes. i can’t use it during the day bc it does not perform well under makeup. using it at night definitely works better. despite this moisturizer feeling light; it is very thick & heavy on the skin & it sits on top. to sum it up, this product is overpriced & underwhelming. i only had a deluxe sample so i can’t speak to long term effects but i see nothing that makes this moisturizer special. to sum it up, this product is overpriced & underwhelming"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Perfect for repairing skin barriers,Absolutely heavenly product that does not irritate the skin of rosacea sufferers! It goes on smoothly and feels super hydrating without being greasy and does not affect makeup application. This would be a great moisturizer for colder/harsher climates.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Very nice face cream!,"I really like this cream! Heavy but not too heavy, very moisturizing and loving the results. Just not sure if I want to spend this much money on a face cream."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Night routine check,I was super excited to receive this product complimentary of influenster because I know how amazing drunk elephant products are and this whip did NOT disappoint. I enjoy using it at night because it leaves my skin feeling absolutely hydrated by morning and it doesn’t feel too heavy…Despite being a bit skeptical on the small size of the sample it doesn’t take a lot to cover my whole face so I know that when I purchase the full size it’ll last me a while which is always a win in my book
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Very hydrating,I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I am pleased with the high quality of the cream. It is very hydrating. I tent to use it at night bc it leaves a slight film that I don’t like under my makeup.  I will definitely purchase after this is empty!

DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,"I have combination skin and this was great for my maskne! As a dental hygienist, I struggle with breakouts and dryness. I used this cream and paired serum for 4 consecutive weeks and have had the best skin. Highly recommend for healthcare workers."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Feels super nourishing,"I love the light, whipped texture of this cream. It feels amazing going on and layers well after the glycolic serum at night. It really hydrates and nourishes my skin, and it feels super soft in the morning."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Great product,"I received this product complimentary for my honest review. I really enjoy this moisturizer! It had a great consistency, doesn’t feel sticky on your face, and gets the job done. Overall, this had been a great moisturizer that hadn’t made me break out."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Fragrance free!,This is now a must have in my routine. I always love a good moisturizer! This one in particular is a little thick so I use it at night but it works very very well and makes my skin super soft ahydhydrated￼
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,A new staple for me!,Love how hydrated this moisturizer leaves my face! Super effective but light enough for daytime wear. Doesn’t get greasy but locks in moisture.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Loved it,I really like the moisturiser. It was perfect at night to really help my serums absorb into my skin and create a barrier. But perfect in the day to go underneath a sunscreen without flaking. I would definitely buy the larger size in this once I run out.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,"I really enjoyed this moisturizer while it lasted! It has a nice feel and consistency, and doesn’t leave my skin greasy. I don’t know how it would effect my skin for the long haul though, since it’s such a teeny tiny sample size. But overall, I’m pleased."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Great consistency!,"Love the texture of the moisturizer, feels thicker than others. Applied smoothly on my face and left it feeling hydrated and refreshed. The price seems a little high, but overall recommend."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,not for me,"I received this product free from influenster 

I liked this moisturizer it’s very balmy which i love but not all the ingredients mesh well with my skin personally. Depending on your skin type this could be good but the ingredients aren’t as clean as i would like either."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Great product!,I’ve been using this moisturizer for the past few weeks and it’s been great for my skin. The texture is perfect and it makes my skin very smooth. Would totally recommend it!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,This makes my skin feel so hydrated after using the gycloic peel
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Lightweight and perfect,Love this light weight and unscented moisturizer! Been using it in the morning before makeup and love the way it makes my skin feel
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Love DE this was a miss!,"I wanted to love this moisturizer cuz I LOVE so many Drunk Elephant products **(HELLO—> TLC Baby Facial anyone!?!) but i honestly didn’t see any difference/improvements over other moisturizers I use that are half the cost. 

I do like the texture~ it’s very lightweight, feels refreshing when putting on & yes a little goes a long way, however I prefer a thicker moisturizer that throws a punch! Keeps me hydrated throughout the entire day. I would definitely recommend for people with sensitive, normal/combination skin!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,So far this seems to work! Received a small sample and no breakouts yet. Don’t know if it is worth the high price tag compared to other moisturizers I have used.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,I absolutely love this product it leaves your skin soft and supple. I love how the feeling of the cream is extremely creamy and soft! I recommend this to all my friends with really dry skin!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Lightweight,"I received this product for free from Influenster. Lightweight product, but I’m not sure if It made a huge difference in my skin routine."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,"This product was enjoyable to use, but i haven’t noticed much of a difference in my skin after a few weeks of using it."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,a little goes a long way!,"Works well! Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean and the packaging is adorable. As someone who has dry skin, I appreciate that a little product goes a long way and I don’t feel the need to reapply it through the night!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Could go either way,"After using this for a month I’m not sure if it helped much with my skin texture and dryness or if it contributed to my new breakouts. As much as I wanted to love it (I use other drunk elephant products that I love!) I can’t say I’d buy this product again. I normally don’t break out around my hair line and after starting this I got a lot of acne around there, when I stopped the acne reduced. The consistency is thick and takes a little time to absorb, but once absorbed I didn’t feel it on my skin."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,I got this complimentary from Influenster. Moisturizes nicely without leaving any residue! Not heavily scented!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,I love the texture of this and have had no issues. I just haven’t had any game changing results either. I’d buy again on a sale probably. I like this for nighttime personally because I reach for SPF during the day.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Amazing!,This stuff is so good! Amazing product! I can feel how it helps my skin. I am very happy with it and will definitely keep buying it!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,perfect pairing for serums,"The Lala Retro Whipped Cream was the perfect pairing with the serum. It was extremely hydrating and I felt like it locked in the moisture (which is important when you’re using a chemical exfoliant).The texture felt very luxurious and sunk right in, but I felt the smell was a little odd. I’m assuming that’s because this thing is packed full of so many skin-helping ingredients. It’s for that reason alone that I’m giving this 4 stars."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,No bad reaction!,"I received a small sample from Influenster and tried it 1-2 times. I love how lightweight it is. It contains ceramides so I know it’s good for my very dry skin. I have eczema and I did not have a bad reaction to this cream despite my sensitive skin. Because it’s a clean product, I may consider purchasing this in the future on my own instead of my typical ceramide cream."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Wish I loved it,"I used this moisturizer for a couple of weeks and absolutely loved how it felt on my skin after the initial application but noticed it actually dried me out quite a bit. It also caused my rosacea to flare up very badly so if you also struggle with that, stay away from this product. I wish I could’ve fallen in love with this and used it as a staple but unfortunately it just isn’t for me!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,"I love love
Loved this cream! Will be purchasing again’"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Not for oily skin,This one has a tad bit chemical smell to it I didn’t like. It a heavy moisturizer so I suggest keeping it light with usage. I have combination skin so I would suggest this for winter season or someone who has really dry skin. I would say it feel nice and smooth with application but have not yet notice anything different compared to other moisturizers.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,A new staple in my routine!,This product is my new holy grail! I have extremely dry skin from after I had my son and it has worked miracles for my dry skin! I received a sample size in turn for my honest review! And it truly will be a new staple in my routine
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Good but not best,"Got as sample from influenster to try. It doesn’t smell bad but I wish it had more of a ‘fresh/clean’ scent. The texture is really nice and goes on smoothly. It moisturizes well but not the best I had, and honestly at the price it is, I would never buy."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,super creamy!,"I received this from influenster for my honest opinion and I was sooo excited to get this box! I’ve been using the products for about 3 weeks. The moisturizer is super creamy and feels great going on and my face feels super soft after.  However, I have oily skin and I think the cream might be just a little heavy for me as I usually use a gel moisturizer.  I do think it’s a nice moisturizer for people with dry skin and I would definitely recommend it!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,This product is super great for my combination skin! A little goes a longggg way and it’s great to use as a primer for your make up! I definitely want to try other products from drunk elephant now :)
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,"I received a sample size of this free from Influenster for testing purposes. I love this whipped moisturizer!

I would definitely recommend, Drunk Elephant has never disappointed."

DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,This is a really lightweight moisturizer that actually feels like whipped cream when applied. It glides so smoothly on the skin and hydrates without that greasy feeling.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Okay,Not my favorite moisturizer... It did its job but did not leave my skin feeling deeply soft. It felt like it floated on my skin rather than settling deeply into my skin the way a creamier moisturizer might. I didn't hate it but I probably won't get it again
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Nice moisturizer,This is a good moisturizer. I really like the consistency and feel that it works to make my face feel softer and moist. I got a sample size of this and it has lasted much longer than expected. There isn’t a strong smell or anything unpleasant about this.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,"this moisturizer is ultra lightweight. it’s not thick and heavy. not the most moisturizing in the world, and i dislike the packaging. i prefer moisturizer in a pump or a tube. i received this product in exchange for a review."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,"Everyone’s skin is different, but this didn’t do much for me. It didn’t moisturize my face, just left it feeling dry and tacky."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,"I love this product. Amazing texture, fast absorbing, no funky smells, simply great! I need this body size."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,I have dry skin and felt like this was very moisturizing. I paired it with the drunk elephant serum.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,"I did like the feeling on my skin. It did not feel oily or greasy. The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars was because I don’t feel it is far superior to other moisturizers. I would buy again, though."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,"I didn’t really notice much of a difference to my skin, but this product isn’t bad. It feels nice on my skin and doesn’t have a strong smell. It’s almost like a hint of baby powder."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,"I received this for free from Influenster for an honest review. I have purchased this before on my own, and I would buy it again. It’s thick but it’s light because it’s whipped, if that makes any sense. It’s very moisturizing but gentle. There is no scent. I have combination skin that gets pretty dry. This can be worn under makeup as it helps with dry patches. I think it would be ok for sensitive skin as well."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,"This moisturizer is great! Super hydrating with a thick, decadent consistency. A little went a long way which was nice but you definitely have to warm it up with you fingers beforehand for it to really absorb into your skin."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Brings me to life,Amazing amazing amazing. My skin is always dryer then a camels crack and this stuff literally does wonders. It will be worth buying !!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,"Out of all the drunk elephant products, this is my favorite. Will always leave your skin very moisturized, more than many other moisturizers I’ve used."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,USA,Drunk Elephant Lala Retro™ Whipped Cream,I was incentivized by Influenster and Drunk Elephant in exchange for my honest review of this product.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Matte Moisturizer,Singapore,Ms.,"I like the feel of the product after application. However, I feel that it is on the pricier side."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Matte Moisturizer,New Zealand,Nice Simple moisturiser ,"One of my Favorites. Keeps my skin oil free, especially on hot days which is something I've always struggled with. its an awesome price and lasts for ages!! "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Matte Moisturizer,Australia,Nice,"I got this as a sample and I really did not expect it to mattify my skin but to my surprise, it did. So I ordered it and I am not disappointed. it is pretty good in absorbing the oiliness after I finish my skincare routine in the morning and sets my skin up for my sunscreen application followed by my daily makeup routine. It has helped control the oils coming through."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Matte Moisturizer,Singapore,matte moisturiser,"Super mattifying, exactly like what the name suggests. Love this for my super oily t-zone. Use sparingly! A little goes a long way! Highly recommended."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Matte Moisturizer,Australia,Great hydrating moisturiser,"This moisturiser was recommended to me during a skin consult. It is super light weight and hydrating. It fits well into my morning and evening routine, leaving my skin feeling refreshed and smooth. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Matte Moisturizer,Singapore,Ms,good product with good value. easy to apply with good product consistency. it’s also unscented which is a bonus. i like to use it in the morning because the matte effect makes my skin looks less oily throughout the day
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Matte Moisturizer,Singapore,interesting ,so far so good. I usually have dry skin hence bought this to apply on my t Zone and it works. doesn't pill when layered with my sunscreen and foundation. good for every day too 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,New Zealand,Ms,"A good product, easy to be absorbed once applied on face, not oily, Also not really strong fragrance, will consider to try another tube once this one finished "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Australia,Miss," Initially tried it through samples given, bought the full size. One of the first sephora line products I had bought. Surprising good, especially for the price. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Malaysia,All Day Hydrator,"Very light weight moisturizer，feel comfort and easy to absorb, and it doesn’t have fragrance and mineral . A nice moisturizer, good to use and recommended for those combination skin"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Canada,Fabulous,"Got this in my advent calendar and it is amazing ... ordering it already as it lasts a long time on my dry, parched skin and never feels tight!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Surprisingly Good,"This is a great, lightweight moisturizer for dry skin.  I love to wear it under makeup because it's light and gives a good base.  The smell isn't the best but it's also not terrible - I can live with it as long as it does the job."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Australia,all day hydrater ,I love this moisturizer it keeps my skin hydrated and smooth whole day. I highly recommend it it’s cheap for a moisturizer and it totally worth its price. It also contain hyaluronic acid which is really good for the skin
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,Calling ALL skin types!  This hydrator is AWESOME!  I wear it after cleansing and before applying my foundation and BAM….I am hydrated and oil free!  I’m 49 years old with combo skin and it works great for me!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,New Zealand,Caused Breakouts,"Really wanted to love this. It’s fragrance free and didn’t upset my sensitive skin which was awesome. It wasn’t as hydrating as I expected, I was trying this instead of the neutrogena hydro boost day cream and after I made the switch my skin was noticeably drier. However I think for normal or slightly dry skin this would be fine. Sadly I started breaking out when I started using this, and then when I stopped the breakouts calmed down. Was disappointed because the ingredients list looked good but I guess this just isn’t for me. I would avoid this if you have combination / acne-prone skin. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Australia,Ms,"By far my favourite Summer moisturiser! I have oily skin, this absorbs quickly and has a nice floral scent. I've repurchased it at least 5 times and even got my boyfriend hooked on it. Definitely recommend it!!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Australia,Holy Grail,Absolutely love this. I apply this then my sunscreen over top. Very light weight but soaks nicely into the skin. Currently on my second bottle. Well worth it!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Singapore,All Day Hydrator,It is lightweight and hydrating. I apply before my application of BB cream.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Australia,Does the job well,"Getting a little older, I found that my previous moisturiser was having to be reapplied during the daytime to prevent dryness. This, however, keeps my skin well hydrated all day. The consistency took a little bit of getting used to (it’s in between a lotion and a cream) but you don’t need a lot of product for full coverage "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Australia,Good product!,"Got this for my mum since she’d been wanting a new moisturiser and it actually works! Her skin looks refreshed and clear, very happy with this product :)"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Australia,Ms,"This is a great moisturizer especially under makeup. The small one lasted just 6 weeks so would buy the large next time, but great size for travel."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Canada,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,"Having used this for a few years now, it's hydrating and a great price and I wish it came in a bigger container. However the new formula smells absolutely terrible."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,"Great moisturizer, aside from the smell ;)","Lots of reviews about the smell and size of the product. Yes, this product has an odd smell - like plasticky? But I can move past that and recognize that this is a great hydrating moisturizer that leaves a beautiful glowy finish to the skin. At first, I was shocked by how small the container was, but soon found that a little goes a long way. Love using on no makeup days, and also find the consistency to be perfect when mixed with a tinted glow drop or foundation."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Philippines,Best affordable day moisturizer,"I bought this intending just to try as it was hyped by my cousin. Since it's the pandemic and I still seldom go out, but stayed indoors with the AC on, my skin does get to dry out. It works perfectly well if you're not going to go out in the sun!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Australia,everyday product ,Perfect for everyday use and I do have sensrive skin and this works fine for me. I would recommended that you use this in conjunction with a serum as it is the perfect balence. Try it trust me!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Canada,horrible product,smells so bad!! The smell is disgusting you do not want this on your skin. It’s too liquids it does not feel like a moisturizer and does not hydrate at all. Wish I could give zero stars.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Australia,Acne break out,After first use I got acne break out all over the fce. not sure its moisturizer or the Foundation customer service recommended. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,This is also great to use as a primer for all my flowy gals!!!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,"Smaller than expected. But the worst part, by far, is the smell. It truly smells smoky like no skincare product I have ever experienced. The results were average and I don’t recommend buying it."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Australia,not as good as it seems,"initially got it as a moisturiser but honestly dried out my skin more than it did good, so I mainly use it as a primer now. still, not the best primer but it does the job."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,New Zealand,all day hydrator,"This product is absolutely amazing a small amount goes a long way and gives your skin a fresh and glowing look and is also suitable as a make up primer which i love
"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Canada,pretty good,I love this product. I love how glowy it makes my skin and how hydrated I feel after using it. My only small complaint is that after a few hours of wear (nothing else on top) it peels.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Singapore,Amazing hydrator,"My 2nd purchase of this product, I’ve been looking for a primer that is compatible for oily skin and won’t worsen it. I’ve been using this product for the last 7 months and it’s only effect is really amazing."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Australia,Ms,"Use this every day. Feels great. 
I don’t normally use products, because most feel heavy, like I’ve got a mask on. This doesn’t. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,You’ll want to add this to your bag,"This moisturizer makes my skin feel so clean and healthy. Some moisturizers can be sticky and thick, but this one is the perfect consistency. I recommend this to all women into skincare!! I typically use with the gel and charcoal mask."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Not Close to the 3.0,"If you LOVED the 3 ingredient moisturizer, don’t bother with this. The old formula worked so well for my acne scars and kept acne at bay. This new formula is terrible. It pills easily with or without makeup. It feels like it is sliding off my face, and my face breaks out horribly now. Please bring back the original 3 ingredient moisturizer."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Malaysia,love it!,"I definitely recommend this product and will
repurchase in the future! It's in my everyday skincare
routine now! It makes a significant improvement on
my skin!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Canada,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,Product does keep my skin from drying out however it feels very heavy on my face and I really don’t like that feeling. Not for me.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Australia,hydrating moisturiser ,"This moisturiser is a great option for everyday moisturiser to wear underneath makeup. It’s not too heavy and melds to skin seamlessly. Great option, great price "

SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,I really wanted to like this product. But it definitely broke me out. It broke me out in cystic pimples will be returning it.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Malaysia,good product ,I like. I think im gonna repurchase for the big one. It is not sticking . It’s dry very very quickly. I feel very comfortable using this one. Sephora product is very good actually. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Canada,A Drink for Dry Skin!,This moisturizer is lovely! It’s lightweight yet makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated. I use it both morning and night and I’ve notice my dry skin is so much better. Even my neck area is more hydrated because of this. And it’s a holy grail for its price point. A must have for me!

SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Australia,Good hydration,"This is a good hysdration for the daytime. I have been using it for a week and it didn't dissapoint. The night time face cfream should be a bit heavier though of you have dry skin. 
"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,Used it for 7 days and I see a difference. My skin is soft. Will definitely buy again and recommend this product.

I waited a bit to make Sue I enjoyed it but my face felt very nice and smooth when using it. I used it in the morning sometimes even to prime my face and it did very well to last
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Canada,Amazing!,"This is my second bottle and after using it for some time, I can genuinely feel my skin feeling more hydrated and plumed. I sometimes mix my foundation in with this primer for a more glowy and dewy finish and it works beautifully."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,what budget ?,Get it works great on dry skin I’m a woman of color
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Australia,Great moisturiser ,"My skin gets pretty dry so I have to apply twice and this feels great under foundation, it doesn’t feel greasy at all and no smell which is nice. Goes on nicely and soaks in quickly, is also great for my sensitive skin."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Canada,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,"Bought this just to try a new moisturizer because I’m incredibly acne prone and OMG - I can’t believe how good it is. Doesn’t leave me greasy, but gives me a glow. Doesn’t make me breakout and the price is right. Wish it had a larger bottle, but I’ll never use any other moisturizer ever again!!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,I loved it!,"I really enjoy how it feels on my skin since I started using it.

My skin felt very moisturized since the day one"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Australia,Amazing ,"My best friend got me this for Christmas in the set and loved everything! This is the best moisturiser, I have dry, highly ance prone skin & am so picky with what I use. Just ordered 3 bottles to stock up!! It’s smoothing, hydrating, reviving & usually last all day, depending on other factors! Would recommend to anyone ❤️"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,New Zealand,hydrate my skin ,I love this product. I am using first time and will definitely buy it again. One of my friends is using this product and she recommended me. I tried this one. I am first time customer of Sephora but really like it. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,GREAT formula… not so great packaging,"The formula is amazing so smooth and lightweight, my only reason I have to give a 4 is because the bottle isn’t so good. Since its a very liquidy moisturizer and it leaks easily and the product is everywhere when you open it… I loose so much product! :( wish it was a pump style."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Singapore,Hydrating,just started using this for about a week. already seeing some results. somehow my pores looks smaller and smoother. keeps my face hydrated the whole day. the smell is abit weird but i guess its cause there's no fragrance.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Singapore,love!,i have oily skin and this feels so lightweight on my skin. i love this! give me a subtle glow without being too overpowering. it’s not sticky. i got the smaller tube but i wish i had gotten the bigger one. i would recommend to my oily skin people. i don’t think it’ll be hydrating enough for dry skin people.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,incredible for the price,"wasn’t expecting much from this moisturizer, but omg it’s one of the best i’ve ever used. i suffered from horribly textured skin, and this has helped completely smooth my skin out. i cant recommend more. the hyaluronic acid does WONDERS. this moisturizer is great to apply before primer/foundation. buying a 2nd bottle soon!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,Been using this product for less than a week and I already see a difference in my skin. I do use my normal moisturizer after applying this and my skin has never felt so good.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,"Super impressed with this! Nice and lightweight, better than drugstore quality products at a similar price. This is a great alternative to a gel moisturizer for summer, if you’re like me and gel lotions cause your makeup to run!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Gets the Job Done,I like it but wish it was a matte finish. It is a little watery so be careful when you squeeze the tube.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Malaysia,All day Hydrator. ,"My MUA suggest me to use this hydrator since I have dry skin. This hydrator really good. It hydrate my skin well, highly recommended. Definitely will repurchase again. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Canada,Absolute Favourite,"I LOVE this moisturizer, and for the price you can’t go wrong. I have combo/acne prone skin and I’ve had no reaction or breakouts using this. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and the nice thing about it for those who don’t love using a primer, it does a good job acting as that as well. It does leave you feeling ever so slightly tacky so I give it time to settle in before applying makeup, but I’ve had no issues as long as I let it settle first."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Australia,decent,"This product does its job, it doesn’t feel like anything super special and I haven’t noticed any difference in my skin at the end of the day like I have with other primers. No scent and I have sensitive skin and it doesn’t irritate my skin at all, does it’s job but nothing special "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Changed scent and consistency : (,"This is my go-to daily moisturizer…I just restocked last week (probably at least my tenth tube). Sadly, I immediately noticed when I used it today that the consistency was thicker and the smell is different. Both negative changes for me personally. Please change it back!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,"OK product, wish it was smoother","Product was not as smooth as I anticipated. I felt like my skin was protected but I also broke out a few times, not sure if it was because of the product itself"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,"It does a good job of hydrating and you need way less than you think. Not a fan of the smell but it doesn’t stick around so not that big of a deal. Probably won’t end up being my go-to moisturizer, but it’s a decent, reasonably priced option."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,"Decent product but you lose 60% of it because of the terrible packaging itself, it spills like everywhere u barely need to squeeze it- then capping it the cap falls off 3 times. Very cheap terrible packaging idk do better sephora"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Nice Affordable Option,"This is a nice medium weight moisturizer that feels good on the face and layers well under makeup.  It is affordably priced, made with clean ingredients, and would work well for people with most skin types."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,"I love this moisturizer and it has quickly become my favorite! It is lightweight and absorbs fast, and doesn’t leave you feeling sticky! It doubles as a primer, and pairs well with both my foundation and BB cream. I also love the dewy glow it gives my skin after I put it on!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,I’ve been using this product as a primer it pairs well with the foundations I have.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Great hydrating serum,This moisturizer is really light and hydrating. It doesn't have much of a scent which I appreciate. It's also clean and vegan which I try to incorporate into my skincare routine.  It's also pretty affordable too!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,"I love this! Instant holy grail for my red acne prone dry skin. Amazing! Even for a dry rashy patch on my neck. Run, don't walk to buy this affordable gem! Better than many expensive hydrators."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,When I tried this I was pretty surprised. I have extremely sensitive skin and I don't change my face cream ever. This was light and did not break me out which was great. This cream is also very affordable.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Canada,Holy Grail for dry skin,"My go to moisturizer. I have super dry skin and this helps it so much. I use it for a primer for my makeup because my skin gets patchy with any foundation, specially in the winter so this really takes away any patchy skin when I use it under my makeup!! I like pairing it with rose hip seed oil when using it during my skincare routine!!!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Radiant Skin,"Loving this moisturizer! It feels fantastic on my skin and hydrates my dry complexion. It makes my skin so soft, glow, and radiant. I would purchase this again and recommend to my friends. This is great day or night and is easy to travel."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,Canada,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,"Absolutely adore this cream. There’s a reason why it is always out of stock at the store! So good for dry skin, the formula makes it so that the Hyaluronic acid doesn’t make my skin even more dry (I live in a very dry climate and so typical HA makes my skin more dry) ! Highly recommend"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Verrry meh,"I would not reccomend this moisturizer. 

The moisturizer feels like a normal everyday moisturizer from the drugstore for like 8 bucks. 

For reference my routine is cleanser, a hydrating toner, serum, a face oil, and this moisturizer. The moisturizer does not last for longer than a few hours even when kayered with other hydrating products.

I take care to introduce products one at a time and give them the best shot at working. I even switched from my salicylic acid cleanser to my hylauronic acid cleanser and it STILL did not come close to being as moisturizing as claimed. 

 The fact that this teeny moisturizer does not keep my skin moisturized after a hydrating toner and a hydrating face oil shows me that it's not very effective."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,Amazing hydrator that is made with clean ingredients (plus it’s vegan! Love!).  My skin loves this stuff—it does a fantastic job at moisturizing without making my skin look greasy at all. I got this as a sample and am immediately obsessed.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,I have seriously loved this product this winter my skin has gotten so dry and I really needed a pick me up.

It’s very hydrating (perfect for this dry season). My skin feels instantly soft, nourished & hydrated! I can’t wait to try more from their skincare line!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Great product,"First time trying a Sephora brand facial product and it was ok. For the cost, I felt slighted by the size as it's far smaller than I expected. It moisturized the skin decently however so I do encourage for people to try the product at least. The price point needs to be improved to reflect the size of the product!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Sephora Collection All Day Hydrator - 50ml,The moisturizer  worked well compared to the other products I’ve tried. I thought  it complimented my skin. The smell was not favorable but so far it’s been doing the job. I would recommend for quality but not so much for scent.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Super moisturizing,I really love this moisturizer.

It has a light cream consistency.it’s very hydrating and isn’t heavy at all which my skin loves. It can also be used as a makeup primer which is a plus. If you’re debating it , get it. I used this and the clean skin gel and my skin never felt more alive."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Very moisturizing,"I absolutely love this moisturizer. I have very dry skin, as well as acne prone. This helps so much with my dryness. Even though my skin is really going through it at the moment it still makes it glow. I love that it’s affordable, quality doesn’t have to be expensive. I lobe that it is vegan and clean at Sephora."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Good quality and cheap,"So happy clean, good quality products no longer have to be expensive. This hydrator had an amazing texture that left my face feeling fresh all day. Definitely superior to other hyaluronic acids I've tried before."

It is the perfect consistency in my opinion, as someone who prefers thinner moisturizers. The product was unscented, and I do wish that it had some subtle fragrance. Overall super hydrating and nice."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All Day Hydrator,USA,Great moisturizer for the price,"Hyaluronic acid is a staple in my skincare routine. I never go without it. This cream is a great formula, thicker than a serum. I found that it sunk into my skin nicely and provided great hydration."

IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,As Ned Flanders Would Say….,"Feels like I’m wearing nothing at all! Nothing at all! Nothing at all! (Like actually though - this formula is light, non greasy, a little goes a long way, reacts very well with my skin, and does the job! Perfect for summer. 5 out of 5)"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,Not suitable for my skin,"This gel lotion by IT caught my attention because it is gel lotion type of moisturiser. Decided to give it a try, but it seems not suitable for my skin and makes it red, oily and itchy. Besides it doesn't seem to absorb into my skin"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,Packed with moisture without feeling sticky or oil,"Such a great product, this helps my makeup stay dewy looking all day, and goes really well under CC+ Nude Glow Lightweight Foundation + Glow Serum"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Australia,great! ,"I use this in summer. I get really oily skin and it’s the only moisture I’ve found that doesn’t make my skin oilier. It’s quite light, so I use a different one in winter to combat dryness. "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Singapore,Good for oily skin,Was looking for skincare product which suits oily skin as well as sensitive skin. Bought this and trust me this was a good decision. It is gel based so just need a pump or two to cover your face area. Using it daily and have good results. 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Australia,Favourite!,"I love this moisturiser! It really makes my face super hydrated and I love how it gives me a natural glowy look. Lasts long on the face and neck, even during dry weathers, keeps my face feeling soft, smooth, and hydrated! A favourite moisturiser, worth buying again!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,Love it!,I have to give this product five stars! It helps to hydrate my skin. Not oily. Easy absorbed. No fragrance. Best ingredients in a bottle! I will definitely re purchase!
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Singapore,Ms,It has a good texture. Feels quite matte after use. However it does not seem hydrating enough if you have very dry skin. I’ve combination skin (oily nose and chin but dry forehead and cheeks) It doesn’t help the fine lines on the forehead and top of cheeks. But it is enough to keep the nose and chin from getting oily. 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Singapore,Vaseline-like moisturiser,"As the title states, this moisturiser def have a Vaseline-like feel. While I do feel my skin feels moisturised, it does not offer anything else. Absorbs well to skin, no sticky feeling at all. Works well as a moisturiser. Will not repurchase."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,"I hate that I love this so much! I have already repurchased twice and haven’t found a similar product to replace it with. I love that it’s in a pump, has no fragrance, and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I hate heavy feeling moisturizers and this gel formula is perfection. I just wish it had better ingredients. I know it’s full of silicones and hate the idea of putting it on face."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,good product ,"“I have extremely dry skin that's also acne prone and sensitive. That's a tough combination to treat because most products that heavily moisturize also cause acne,” This lotion is by far the best I've used! I can slather it on as much as I want without any irritation or acne and it soaks right in and soothes my dry skin. I'm a lifetime customer for sure.”"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Hero product!,Hero product. Have repurchased. My favorite lotion EVER. Highly highly recommend. Makes my face feel like butter. Not sticky.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,Hmmm,I tried this out after reading glowing reviews on beautypedia. Happy that it's fragrance free. But I don't think it's enough moisture for 40s skin. The texture is almost too watery for me. I prefer a thicker consistency. 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,Smooth Texture,Works well as a moisturiser. I especially like the smooth texture that glides onto my skin. Does not feel sticky after application. The packaging is convenient for dispensing as well.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,Worth it,"I love this product, it works great but not the best ive tried. I got this during sephora sale so its very worth it. Lots of product, act like moisturizer and can be a primer too. I normally bring this when i travel because i dont want to bring too much stuff. "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,"I really really like that this product is in a pump and I don’t have to dip my fingers in- I was alternating this with another product (Neutrogena water gel) and I hate that this is double the price but I try to buy products that work for my skin as well as my teenage sons and this does. If it was more affordable, one more star"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,Fell in love 🥰🥰,"A little goes a long way 😉 Before i bought this, i've done a bit research on the reviews at youtube, google and sephora. A lot of good reviews about it and so I decided to buy because I want something more to boost hydration on my skin. I have sensitive combo skin plus acne - much obliged to use moisturiser that provides boost hydration. The result is - it WORKS! I use this only in morning after toner, essence and serum - I practiced layering on my skincare routine. This product doesn't dries my skin and it literally feel moist and less oily. I think this also one of the factor that cause very less acne appear on my skin - which is better than before. My tips on #acnetreatmentjourney is never let your skin dry. Boost it with more hydrating products 👍🏼"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,"This feels so soft and silky on my skin I am in love! I usually purchase olay regenerist, but I wanted to treat myself to something a little more luxurious. 

No offensive scent, wears great under makeup and keeps my skin hydrated without being too heavy!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Australia, Buy it ,this is  the best I love it so much you should buy it it feels really nice on you skin and supper light weight not to think with I hate  so you should really buy it 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,this is my go to daytime lotion as it is light and keeps my skin feeling moisturized. it provides a decent base for my sunblock. I don't think there's any scent. I also enjoy the packaging as it's very convenient
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Australia,love it,"I love the feel of this on my skin, 2 pumps in the morning and I am good to go. It has a nice silky texture that I was looking for in a morning moisturiser."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Pure slippery silicone,"I dont know why anyone would like this. It is like pure silicone (dimithicone, a silicone is the third highest ingredient). It is very slippy, and does not absorb at all. It feels like I have a greasy veil over my skin and it does not feel healthy or nourished at all. I got a sample of this and would never buy it. I avoid silicones because they dont look good and I doulbt they would be good for the skin, as your skin is likely to absorb some of what you put on it. It makes my skin feel like its suffocating."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,"I have oily skin that becomes combo in Canadian winters, so my mattifying origins moisturizer has been too drying! I did some research and decided to take a chance on this (keeping my receipt) but honestly this is a fantastic moisturizer, just what I was looking for and needed! I only use a pump and a half for my whole face and neck and it dries down within a minute. It definitely gives me the hydration I’ve been craving without making me oily and improving my make up as a bonus !. Love this, just try it"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,"This is my favorite daytime moisturizer! It is great for combination or oily skin since it dries matte and is very light. It has a ""primer like"" texture and almost blurs out your pores so I love to wear it under makeup. This is my holy grail, I have repurshased it 3 times over the last years. The bottle also lasts almost a year for me so that's a great bonus! Overall I would recommend it to everyone unless you have very dry skin as it's only downside is that it doesn't hydrate as much as other moisturizers."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,Best moisturiser ,"Like the product a lot. Very light weight,  not greasy at all.... Best oil free moisturiser for me.  Would highly recommend and  will purchase again. 🥰"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,"Holy grail. It's lightweight, keeps my skin so soft and hydrated, I swear it blurs pores, and it doesn't give the the same shiny film across my T-zone like every other moisturizer I've tried."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Australia,it cosmetics,"Amazing! light weight, silky, smooth - absolutely obsessed! Would highly recommend. I use both day and night, already seen such a change in my skin. Wish I knew about this product sooner "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Perfection !,"This is the best oil free moisturizer I have  used. The ingredients list is full of good things: several peptides, sodium hyaluronate, AHAs (citric acid and lactic acid), soluble collagen, and more. I feel good about putting this on my face, and my face loves it!.A light gel that is not greasy, but truly hydrates and doesn't pill under primer or makeup. Perfection!."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,Love!!,"Love this product! It’s super light weight and not at all greasy. I have acne prone, fairly oily skin and this moisturizer works so well for me. Another bonus is that it lasts a very long time - great for the price!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Australia,Nice and light,"I really like this moisturiser, it's got an almost silicone-ish texture out of the bottle, but when applied to the skin dries to a soft powder finish. It's really hydrating without leaving you sticky or shiny so it's the perfect pre-makeup moisturiser. I still use a heavier night-moisturiser for my combination-dry skin, but this is a great AM one to start the day.  "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,New Zealand,Lightweight and good ,I've just started using this for a few days as my daytime moisturizer. It's very light and blends well with the skin. I put my SPF moisturizer after this and both blends well. It also blends well with my BB cream and it has a light lemony smell which is quite refreshing. 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Singapore,Smoothes out skin,"Love this gel version, as the cream version was too rich for my combination skin. Smoothes out my skin beautifully, and I do not experience any break outs. Will definitely repurchase! ^^ "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,Hydrating and non irritating,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Great for dry sensitive skin, like a nourishing protective primer that seemed to work well with my makeup. Got it as a sample, it’s hard to find products my skin gets better from and this one helped"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,Fantastic,"I love this product. I got a mini size sampler once and immediately fell in love and had to get the bigger size as soon as it came in. It’s light and makes my skin feel 100 times better than any other product. I don’t wear a lot of makeup (usually only mascara) unless I’m getting really dolled up to go out, so this product works wonders for daily use. Highly recommend!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,"One of the best!!! Keeps skin hydrated for a long time,  best one I have tried (and ive tried ALOT)"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Wonderfully feeling powdery gel lotion!,"Lovely gel lotion, feels like powder in gel form! It has such a light airy feeling, absolutely love this lotion!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,"I have dry skin and live where it is cold so in winter so this wasn't moisturizing enough for me - at first - but when I went on vacation to a hot place my regulars stuff was way too greasy and this was perfect especially under sunscreen.  This is now my favorite summer/hot weather moisturizer. Goes on smoothly, my skin feels and looks great, doesn't ball up or make me look like a greaseball, and accepts serious sunscreen on top if it. I took off a star because in winter with the heat on it's not enough for really dry skin."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Doesn’t break me out,"This is one of the only moisturizers that my skin likes. I don’t know why, but whenever I try out a new moisturizer, I tend to break out. Maybe I’ve gotten so used to this one, but it really does seem to keep my skin moisturized and balanced. Good for moisturizing, though I sometimes add a face mist under if I want something extra.

I struggle with acne, and as far as I can tell, in the many months I have been using this, it has bit broken me out. I like the ingredient list for this also."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Wanted to love this but it is heavy and doesn’t dry weightless like Clinique
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Could be so much better…,"I’m so glad I only received a sample of this. The smell is so strong and artificial, almost like plastic or rubber, and you really can’t use it under makeup, it doesn’t dry well at all. By itself, it might be okay if the smell was toned down, but I had to wash it off before putting on my foundation."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Pleasantly suprised,"Was looking for a more affordable gel moisturizer and since I had such good luck with the foundation I thought I would try this. It is a great product, it is not oily in any way and sits well on the skin, not sticky at all. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated without looking shiny, as I absolutely hate that ""dewey"" look! As someone who has had to deal with oily skin all my life, I want to avoid that shine as much as possible. My skin looks good after this lotion, but not shiny, so I am very pleased. Plus it has a nice pump on it so you don't have to mess around with digging into the lotion to apply it, a really nice feature. Will definitely buy again."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,"I love this stuff it just works really well with my skin. I have been lucky enough to been able to try several high end moisturizers along with a lot of the cult favorite drugstore brand moisturizers but none of them have been as good as this one. It’s a perfect based for retinol (right now I’m using Luna oil, another HG) and during the daytime I use it to seal in all my serums. The only fault I’ve found is during the day it can leave a slip on my face when I’m outside in the heat, it needs some time to absorb in warmer climates. I also let it set for awhile before applying spf. Regardless it plumps the skin and leaves it looking radiant and feeling deeply moisturized. On the other hand the confidence in a cream broke me out horribly, this never has..they also offer a sample size to try before splurging—you can also go somewhere else and find small sizes in bulk for cheap"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,I got a small sample size to try out and I love the texture and the light airy feel and I might consider buying a regular size to try out for longer. It goes on smooth and leaves my skin moisturised and glowing. I normally use Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Cloud cream or Caudalie Vinoperfect and I really think that  IT confidence in a gel lotion compares favourably to my Water Drench moisturiser.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,amazing,"This is my favorite gel moisturizer, it goes on so smooth and makes my skin so soft. It’s not greasy at all. It works well under makeup too."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,New Zealand,Light but nourishing,"This is so lovely and gentle on my very sensitive, combination skin. It is a light, gel texture, doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy and I haven’t experienced any redness or burning. My skin actually seems to be having less breakouts also. It sits well under makeup and is fragrance free. Ticks all my boxes!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Philippines,Good for oily skin,"I hated the regular confidence in a cream, because it was so heavy and oily for a tropical country. But I'm glad I gave the gel cream a chance. I use this in the morning and layer my sunscreen over. Before I used to apply my sunscreen directly on my face, but it made my skin look so oily and the sunscreen pill after a few hours. With the gel cream, my skin looks so natural and not oily plus it doesn't make my sunscreen pill. How great is that! "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Singapore,Simply Amazing,Love this product. it is very hydrating & not at all sticking 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Singapore,Confidence In A Gel Lotion,"Very smooth and watery texture, light weight and fast absorbs into the skin. Face has smoothen and make up stays, will purchase again once it has finished."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,Good for dry skin,"Purchased this gel moisturizer for my mum, good for her dry skin"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,Did not like the texture,"Expected this gel lotion to have a more gel-ish consistency, but it turned out to be more silicone-y like. Due to the strange texture, I have not been using it as much and it’s sad because I love most IT cosmetics products."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Singapore,Love!,I like this gel lotion. Absorbed into skin quickly after application. Acts as a good primer before foundation as well. On my first bottle and will definitely buy it again. New favourite! 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,not good under make up,This is a terrible gel for under make up.  Would never recommend!! I don’t find this to be moisturizing at all!
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,This Stuff Works Miracles,"I’ve been using this for about two months now, and WOW. I have combination skin, and literally EVERY. SINGLE. PRODUCT. I’ve ever tried has made my face an oil slick overnight. Not this one!! I got a sample size as part of the bye bye pores kit (with the primer and leave on solution), and I was immediately HOOKED. 2020 was the year of horrific, never ending breakouts, but this stuff hydrates and keeps the oil at bay without clogging my pores! Put this in your cart right now. Seriously, right now. Why are you still here??"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Perfect gel based lotion for combination skin!,"I have combination skin and i always struggled with moisturizers, either they were heavy or so greasy they made me break out. No more! Ever since I got my hands on this product, I’ve used it every single day for almost 1.5 years-maybe more! It’s super light, blends into skin effectively and makes makeup just glide on. Working from home, I’m not using much makeup so I just put it on every single morning after cleansing my face and applying a serum. It sets in within minutes and i’ve never felt my face dry since i started using it, constant moisture! I don’t even try any other lotion for my face."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,"I wanted to give this a chance because the reviews are so good, but I found the smell to be really strong and just not good, and it felt waxy and oily on my face. I was really happy when the bottle was done to be honest"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,good,"This IT cosmetics gel lotion is good moisturizer under makeup. The moment you apply it, you will immediately feel like, its not only a moisturizer but serves as a primer as well.  You just have to apply a pee size amount for the whole face and you are done with it. Definitely recommend it to a friend."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,"I love this product. I have dry acne prone skin and often react to products with redness and burning. I tried many products to help and my skin was still red and flaking. I had an old sample of this I tried on a whim, as nothing was helping (including my Josie Marian which is argan oil and aloe). One night of this and my flakes were significantly reduced. My skin barrier was much improved and my skin was calmer and less red. I was worried bc of the high silicone content however after speaking to my dermatologist he explained that silicones have received a bad rap and that they can help protect the skin, trap moisture, and promote healing. I bought this product immediately knowing my sample would only last a few days, and the results have been great. I find it works well as a primer for makeup too, so I use this before their cc cream. I haven’t had any issues with acne since using this over the past few months."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,it cosmetics confident in a gel lotion,When apply at face it will be so glossy and a sticky i not really like that feels.if your skin not oily recommended if your skin oily not recommended but ilove it this product 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Left my skin feeling greasy.,"It leaves my skin feeling greasy and I can definitely feel it on my skin.  I keep using it and I’m really trying to like it because I spent so much on it, but I usually end up wiping it off shortly after applying. And it STILL leaves me with a greasy, slick feeling on my face. I think the Confidence in a Cream is much better. I’ll suffer through the rest of this bottle because I paid for it, but I’ll stick to the cream from here on out."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,I don’t see any difference yet ,"This is an honest review. I expected more for this product but apparently after one month of trial, I don’t see any difference or improvements. It’s just an ordinary moisturiser. "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Meh. get confidence in a cream instead,Feels nice on the face but it has silicones and that always concerns me. I feel like you can find something better. I would get confidence in a cream instead.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Good for extra plumping under moisturizer,I've used this for a few years and it's a solid product. I apply it after serums with actives & before moisturizer or moisturizing sunscreen since it's good for an extra boost of moisture & also a good substitute for a plumping serum that's twice the price.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,Not too bad,"It is good value for money at 75ml bottle. It’s consistency however, is more fluid than drug store brands. My skin does feel moisturized all day but it might not be so under cooler environments. Would I buy it again? No. "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,Gel,Not nearly hydrating enough. Had high hopes for this item but missed the mark. It has great ingredients though wish it was more hydrating then it would be so perfect
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,I don’t love it. It’s oil free but leaves my skin feeling greasy and leaves behind an almost film like feeling on my face. Feels like it just sits on too of my skin.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,underwhelmed,I've heard many good things about it cosmetics but this moisturizer is just not it. It doesn't do much to my combination skin and I've been using it for months. Expected more from it but it was just underwhelming. :(
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,B Confidence,the product is certainly reasonable in price. the packaging is very convenient and hygiene and i am able to share it with my sibling.the moisturiser is smooth and makes my skin supple. it is nice to use when you are in a cool n dry environment. the moisturiser is also not greasy and it absorbs well into the skin in no time.this moisturiser is working well for me and didn't cause any outbreaks so far on my combination skin.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,I love this moisturizer! It is SOOOOO soft and silky smooth. It legit glides across my skin and has a very light feel! Will definitely be buying again!
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,So Soft!,"I've purchased this a few different times and keep coming back to it!  It feels so soft on my face and is perfect in the morning before makeup.  I typically use something heavier at night, but this is a great lightweight lotion for daytime."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,Shiny face,"My skin is pretty normal and even when I put a really small amount I get soooo shiny whenever I get a little bit hot. Not like working out hot, just a little hotter than normal. Would not recommand for people who gets usually shiny."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,worth the buy!!!,Love this moisturizer!!! I’ve been using the IT Cosmetics brand moisturizers for quite some time now and this is my favourite so far. Super light weight non greasy formula leaves my skin feeling so fresh. Great for sensitive skin and works great under make up! I go through the bottle fairly quickly moisturizing day and night compared to the tubs.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,just missing the spf,"Seems great so far. Very moisturizing but not to much for combo skin. Doesn’t dry tacky or sticky. No stinging in eyes. If it had an spf, would be perfect!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Great for sensitive skin,"I just love this! My skin sometimes needs moisture, but with most creams it makes me feel like an oil slick. This gel lotion hydrates very well, my skin drinks it up and it doesn’t sit on top of my skin. I don’t end up greasy like I do with heavier creams. I have sensitive skin and this works well for me."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,"I have ultra sensitive, breakout prone skin and WOW. This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. It has made my skin as close to perfect as it has ever been. It leaves it soft, moisturized, and has a matte finish. I'm obsessed and will never buy anything else ever again."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,good non-greasy daily moisturiser,"got this at promo,curious with the brand.it's a gel-like moisturiser,similar to pudding.i'm dry sensitive and in the need for long hour hydration under full makeup & a/c.at 1st felt weird like silicone-mask,a bit slow in absorption.but keep massaging & once absorb,skin felt plump & soft.can't comment much on the 72-hour claim but my skin stay moisturise all day until it's time to take off my makeup.no breakout or allergy,no smell which i fancy.easy for travel since it's handy & light.would love to try other product under this brand.promising enough."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Singapore,Good,Quite pricey but lasts a long time for a small bottle. I feel that it moisturises sufficiently but not if you have very dry skin. Sinks in nicely into skin and doesn't make my makeup slide around. Would continue to purchase this when my bottle runs out.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Great moisturizer BUT....,"I've been using this product for over a year. It does leave your face feeling hydrated and I like that this gel absorbs really quickly into the skin, so wearing it under make up is not a problem. It basically has no scent and the gel is not sticky when I apply it to my face. I also have rosacea so I like how sensitive this product is; it doesn't irritate my skin and there is no burning sensation after application. But I noticed that it doesn't reduce the appearance of fine lines and doesn't do anything for uneven texture, which is why I gave it 3 stars. I will be looking for another product to address these concerns. I would recommend this product to those who are not really concerned about aging."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Perfect for fast night moisturizer.,Love this. It is very soft! I put it on my face an neck everyday and night. Its light and leaves my face super soft. Not oily or heavy.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,"Silicone primer, Not a moisturizer",This is nothing more than a silicone primer. Face will feel smooth after applying since this product is heavy in silicone but not particularly hydrating.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Singapore,love this!,Lightweight and doesn’t make me break out at all! I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this is one of the best moisturisers I’ve tried. Works really well on oily skin and in humid climates! 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,Love the texture! ,The texture makes it a winner! Lightweight and not oily on my skin. It keeps my skin feel dewy as it coated with balm. I can feel my skin breathe with this moisturiser. I also apply it on my neck. Now on my second bottle and counting! 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,hydrating but oily,This is a hydrating product. I noticed my face was nourished. The thing I did not like about this was I found my face extra oily throughout the day. As I used it more I noticed right away it felt oily and not absorbed completely into my skin. I personally will not be reaching for this product unless my face is very  dry and look for something that absorbs well and somewhat matte or natural instead.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,good product,"i have very sensitive skin,but this product suits me well even its my first try,its moisturizing and soothe my skin,the product absorb really well into my skin,will purchased this item again"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Weightless moisturizer = Incredibly happy skin,"Amazing moisturizer, perfect for summer with a pleasant scent"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,Love It,"Bought this because the Confidence in a Cream did not suit me (it made me look like an oil sheet). This product does not disappoint. Love the packaging - hygienic and convenient. It pumps out great, and is easily spread and absorbed on the skin. Feel super light and refreshing and is not oily. Goes well under makeup and does not break me out. "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Singapore,very light on my skin.,Really gave me confidence in every application on my face. Not sticky on my face and it’s really moisturising. Will buy again in the future. Bought this together with other it products. I love it cosmetics.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Hydrating great for oily skin,Hydrating  good to use year round. Good for people with acne and redness
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,perfect for summertime oily skin!,I have combo acne prone skin and this moisturizer has been near perfect. My skin is soft and moisturized but not oily or shiny. I appreciate the pump packaging as opposed to a jar. There isn't too much fragrance which I always prefer. I may need something a bit heavier in the winter but until then this is great!
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Canada,Very Moisturizing,"I love this lotion, it goes right into my skin. Makes it so smooth and soft. I have combination skin mostly oily so it really agrees with my skin."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Malaysia,amazing product but leaves skin oily ,"At first I was skeptical about this, but bought to try anyway. The gel like texture is not bad on the skin, keeps skin moisturized and soft, however after some time the skin becomes oily. May not be suitable for my skin afterall"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Best Gel Face Lotion!,I love how smooth this gel lotion goes on your face without being sticky or greasy. Leaves a nice fresh feeling while your skin feels plump and smooth. It does take a lil bit to soak in the skin but definatly feels weightless.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Slick,"I got a small sample that lasted a few uses. Yes this is lightweight, easy to spread gel that's moisturizing when you apply it, but I did not feel like it kept my face moisturized long afterwards. I guess it absorbs quickly? Its texture also feels slick, almost like oily without the greasiness... I don't hate it but I won't repurchase."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Australia,love,Super nice quick absorbing gel. Wouldn’t work for dry skin but great for oily skin. I have combination skin after my toner/serum/eye cream so I just the peter Thomas Roth cloud cream under this with a face oil in my dry areas then this on top to seal it all in. 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,FEELS AMAZING!,"I love all things IT Cosmetics so I knew I had to try their Gel Lotion. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and the texture is amazing! It literally goes from a gel to feeling like cool water absorbing into your skin. It feels so great when you put it on and my skin is becoming more smooth by the day!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,Keep an eye on your pores,The texture is nice but doesn't feel like a gel moisturizer. It's more like a primer and my pores did NOT like it. I'm prone to clogged pores which is why I use gel lotions (they are usually lighter) but not this time...
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Gel Lotion,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Gel Lotion,Wearing a mask everyday has really dried my skin out but using this has saved me! Feels light and layers well with my face oil. Will repurchase.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,Canada,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,"Been using this cream since 5 months while being on accutane. My skin has been super dry but this just makes it soft and hydrated. I use it in the AM and in the PM.
Adds glow and shine!"
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,"Great daytime moisturizer! I love SPF moisturizers, the spf scent is there, but just slightly. That would be my only complaint. I have tried other daytime moisturizers w SPF that don’t smell like SPF at all. Otherwise, no complaints!"
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,It’s like moisturizing with dish soap.,"I was in LOVE with the Essential Energy that they discontinued. This one makes my face feel dry but greasy and doesn’t do a thing for my complexion. And unlike the other moisturizer that smelled amazing, this one smells like dish soap. I used the whole bottle to give it a fair chance, but I won’t be buying it again."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,Got this for my mom and she likes it glad it’s didn’t give her any side effects and it smells nice as well

Received this for free for my honest opinion"
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,"The product melted into my skin beautifully to create a dewy and hydrated appearance after each use. I used it both as a day and night cream and before applying foundation as a primer. As someone with dry skin, its difficult to find facial creams that really hydrate my skin., but this one worked beautifully. I have been using the product for about 3 weeks and have noticed my skin is more radiant and moisturized."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Hydarting,"Loved the hydration, and how ir lasted on my skin. It didn’t hace a strong scent, which is great as well. The packaging is perfect!"
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Hydrating Cream,"After a day at the pool, this hydrating cream was perfect to put a little moisture back into my skin! It doesn’t smell too strongly and the packaging is nice. It did make my skin a little more oily than other hydrating creams I’ve used, but overall I really liked this product!"
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,I’ll start with what I do like about it… it doesn’t make my face feel greasy and feels like it’s moisturizing but I have found that my skin is still really dry no matter how many times I use this. I don’t know if it’s the moisturizer or my skin is just dry. Also don’t like how it’s so heavy!! I had to put in different container due to the weight but overall I like the product and still use it daily!
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Skin plumped,I enjoyed wearing this sunscreen in the AM and PM. It’s not super thick and has been very moisturizing during the summer months.

I also have sensitive skin and this has not caused me to breakout which is a major plus!!!"

SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,It’s an ok option,"I didn’t notice any long term benefits with this, but does an ok job of moisturizing the skin. It did sting my eyes a little bit, but that went away pretty quickly. It a rich cream that absorbs well."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,"Great! 
So improvement in my skin within two weeks 
Absorbed easily plumps up the skin"
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Highly recommend this!,Very light & airy moisturizer. My skin (especially my face) feels suoer soft & moisturized the entire day. My skin even after using toner has a soft glow look as well. I truly recommend this moisturizer & I have (during certain seasons) very sensitive skin & this did not cause any reaction whatsoever.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,I’ve been using this product for sometime now. I’ve actually already finished it and I need more lol. I highly recommend this product.

I definitely recommend to those with dry skin, although I do think that people with oily complexion would get great results with this cream as well. I have sensitive skin and had no issues using this daily. Thank You to Influenster for the complementary product!"
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,not good for my skin,"My skin is more on the oily side and sensitive. I tried
the moisturizer with SPF and thought it worked well,
until I used it daily for a week and started seeing
inflamed little pimples that felt itchy all throughout
my face. I was hopeful to try this moisturizer without
SPF, but after using it consistently for a few days, I
still ended up with the same reaction. Safe to say I
would not be able to use this moisturizer brand.
However, my mom tried it (her skin is not oily) and she
really likes it. No preference between SPF vs. no SPF.
They both work just as good for her. I did enjoy the
way the moisturizer felt on my skin when I first tried it.
Also the texture was nice and not too thick. Would
recommend for people who do not have oily or
sensitive skin."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Amazing moisturizer!!!,"Love love love this product, I used it daily and to be honest, I normally will get tired of a product and push it back to my skin care fridge but this one I used until it was empty!! Which is rare for me. I love that this product also had SPF and hylauranic acid in it as well! 10/10 recommended to friends and family!!"
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,This has been a life changer. It’s such a good hydrating formula that makes my skin feel so soft. It’s not heavy at all and works well under make up. I usually have dry skin in the summer but this has made my skin so glory and healthy.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Moisturizer,"Hydrating, lightweight and non greasy.   Unscented.   Only thing that could make it better is some spf."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Súper hydrating,This is super hydrating cream!! Only cream I use so far
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Amazing depending on skin type.,I like this as I received it through Influenster to sample and leave an honest review. I have combination skin and with this it makes my skin pretty oily which it’s already extremely oily. I don’t think adding more oil is helping. I gave some to my daughter though and she loves it.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,This product is definitely hydrating with lasting results. My skin feels so soft and not oily. Great way to start the day and before putting on makeup!
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Buy it but pair with a matte foundation.,"I do like and i do use daily but for my combination skin it does make me oily at times. 
I did receive this as a complimentary vox box off of influencer. I did ended up buying and gifting to my momma and she said she absolutely loved it! And i always trust what she says."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Love it!,I love this product! I have very drying skin so a good moisturizer is a must for me. It leaves my skin feeling moisturizer without the feeling of being weighted down.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,I received this complimentary from Influenster and Shiseido for my honest review. I actually am pregnant and my midwife suggested I don’t put this on my skin especially during the 1st trimester so that tells me something about the ingredients/chemicals in this product… I wasn’t able to use it so I can’t tell you much else except I won’t be trying/buying it even after I give birth.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Perfect Hydration,"This Hydrating Cream has a thick white texture. It provides the perfect amount of moisture for my skin. My skin tends to lean more toward dry versus oily, so this stuff is everything I needed. I love this brand. Shiseido never disappoints! Leaves my skin hydrated and feeling smooth."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Love this stuff!,"LOVE those cream. Also have the cream with SPF, which I love, but this one is thinner, smoother, and doesn’t have that hint of sunscreen smell. I do love having the SPF included in the other cream for a morning daily application, but this one is good for when you just need a refresher of hydration. Great stuff!"
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,This is a nice and hydrating moisturizer. I used at nighttime since it doesn’t have spf. It kept my skin soft all night. The only downside for me was the added fragrance. I received this complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,A really nice hydrating cream that I use for my nighttime routine. I have combo skin and this doesn’t feel too heavy on the skin but it does hydrate really well.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,"I received this product complimentary for testing. I was so excited to try it, but unfortunately it made me break out."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Super Hydrating,This night cream is incredible. It's super creamy and rich. It feels amazing on my skin and leaves it super soft and hydrated. I have combination skin and this cream doesn't feel heavy or oily on my skin. A little product goes a long way. And the packaging is super high quality and looks luxurious.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,"This isn’t as thick as the day cream with SPF version. Although I love any product with SPF, and do love the creaminess of the other, I prefer this version during the summer since I need something a bit lighter in this hotter, sweatier weather. This also doesn’t seem as strongly scented as the day cream, which will probably be better for those with more sensitive senses. Overall, I would recommend if you have a great face sunscreen to layer with it or only plan to use it at night."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Great Moisturizer,Great moisturizer - definitely on the heavier side though
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Best daytime moisturizer for combination or dry sk,"I have been using this amazing moisturizer for weeks now and it has become a staple in my skin care routine. I love the light scent and how it moisturizes without feeling heavy or greasy. I will be keeping this in my day routine for good! You converted me Shiseido!!!
I absolutely love this product"
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Good for oily to normal skin type,"I liked this cream as it is very smooth and light weight. But for the hydration it didn’t help much as my skin type is combination so on the dry part it didn’t help but apart from that it’s good and blends in very easily. I think if you have oily to normal skin then it should be good for you but with people having dry skin type, probably it will not work for them."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Creamy & luxe!,"The Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream is super creamy and luxe feeling! Shiseido is a company I can rely on to have quality products. This super hydrating cream is great for those with dry skin, I like how smooth & hydrated my skin feels after using. The only con is the added fragrance, which is a bit strong. Fragrance can often be aggravating for those who are acne-prone. Overall, definitely a great quality moisturizer!"
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Quality Product,I think you need to read the ingredient to make sure it won’t irritate your skin. I liked this product but I do believe it caused my skin to break out.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,For Dry Skin,I loved how it make my face nice and smooth! Definitely hydrated my skin throughly. Only thing is i rather have thin formula and not so thick! But other then that I recommend it to those who had a dryer skin type.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Love it!,I love this product! It leaves my face so soft! I've also used it on my arms because ... why not! And it leaves them so smooth! They need a body lotion with the same results! I highly recommend it!
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,"I received this product from Influenster to test in exchange for an in depth product review. 
Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Day Cream has been an AMAZING addition to my skin care routine! It is thick & somewhat heavy at first but my skin literally drinks it right up & feels SO good afterwards! It moisturizes without making my skin look or feel oily/greasy. A little bit of the product goes a long way, so I feel like it will last me a long time, making it well worth the price."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,The best,"In love with this line. My skin looks amazing when I consistently use this cream morning & night. Less breakouts, less irritation, very nicely hydrated. It's thicker texture will make it a super good hydrated cream in the cooler months"
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Love it!,"I absolutely love this moisturizer! It leaves my skin feeling so soft, smooth, hydrated and glowing. It’s not greasy or heavy and doesn’t cause breakouts. It’s a win!"
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Hydrating and reduces wrinkles,I have been using this cream every day for the past 3 months and love it. I feel like it has hydrated my skin and has decreased my wrinkles. I received 2 complimentary jars of this and am expecting to start the 3rd jar sometime this week. Definitely worth the price for how long it lasts! The pictures I uploaded of the full face was from shortly after starting the cream and the close up picture is the most recent.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,This Essential Energy Hydrating Cream is my new holy grail!! It has transformed my dry skin into soft beautiful glowing skin in a matter of a couple weeks of using! Definitely will be my favorite for years. Definitely recommend
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,"I like the thickness, and how it absorbed into my skin. The scent is nice and light. It’s lighter than a night cream, heavier than a lotion. It’s nice, there’s just nothing special about it, nothing that would make me reach for this over another product."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Smooth and refreshing,"Lovely, sits nicely on the skin and is hydrating without being super thick and greasy."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,Received this complimentary from influester . The creme comes in a nice and elegant packaging. Looks good on my vanity. Smell is good and not overwhelming . Consistency nice and thick.  Wdy moisturizing . Price is a little hefty. But if you like it enough I would splurge :)
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,I liked this one more than the one containing sPF. I think the SPF is what made my skin break out. I’m not a huge fan of the moisturizer but it does leave your skin feeling hydrated.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,"This lotion is so lightweight and moisturizing! It really makes my skin glow. I'm not a big fan of the perfume scent, but it does fade away pretty quickly. I like that I can pair it with a sunscreen and it sits well under makeup. Definitely recommend!"
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Creamy dreamy,Thick and creamy and hydrating without being heavy or greasy on the skin. It doesn't break me out and makes my skin look good. I like that it has hyaluronic acid in it because then I can skip a step in my skin care routine since it's already built in. I received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Hydrating cream,"I really like this cream! It feels luxurious and didn’t irritate my skin! I like the spf version for daytime and this one for night. There is no fragrance really, which is nice!"
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Hydrating cream,It is very thick hydrating cream which is great for the night time. But it was not enough for the day so reason I strictly just use for the night. And I recommend not using under makeup it didn’t do well. I did receive it to do this review
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,I waited a long time to receive this product and let me tell you it was worth the wait! This moisturizer is so luxe and makes my skin care routine special. My skin never felt softer first thing in the morning and super hydrated throughout the day! 100% recommend
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Hydration Station,I loved the SPF formula but this one I turned to for my night time routine. It has everything I need to keep my face from feeling flaky and dry and doesn’t leave my pillow greasy.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Truly amazing,i have been testing this for a while now. I will definitely buy. first off it keeps me so hydrated. it doesn't feel sticky like a lot of face creams. I use it every morning.l and I would recommend people to try this out. even my mom started to use it lol. it's also beautiful packaging.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,"Amazing feeling on skin, feels youthful and gives your skin a plump feel"
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Very hydrating!,"This cream is thick and luxurious, but goes on smooth and doesn’t feel greasy. It’s very hydrating and doesn’t make my skin break out, which is very important."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,"A hydrating day cream with the following:

Ginseng Root Extract to support hyaluronic acid production and strengthen skin’s moisture barrier.

Hyaluronic Acid to deliver, attract, and retain moisture.

It comes in a beautiful jewel-like jar that’s refillable. Included is a small spatula. The cream is thick, rich and leaves the skin with a dewy finish. Good for those with dry skin but not recommended for those prone to oiliness or prefer a more matte finish. It has worked well as a base for foundation which glides on easily over this. There’s a moderately strong scent that’s typical of Shiseido products."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Wonderful product for all skin,I received this compliments of Influenster and highly recommend it. I have used many different kinds of hydration cream in the past and feel this is a great alternative to the Tatcha water cream. It has a very subtle scent and a light formula that keeps my skin from being dry but doesn't leave it oily either. It comes with a small scooper so you don't have to use your fingers to apply if you don't want. I will continue to purchase this after my sample is gone.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Hydrating,"Creamy, cool and smooth. This cream feels good going on and absorbs quickly. Leaving my skin feeling refreshed and hydrated."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,It’s ok,"I feel a little neutral about this product. I didn’t really like or dislike it. Compared to other products, it’s mediocre. I don’t believe that this is worth the amount of money they are selling it for. This is just my opinion. I received this product as a complimentary for testing purposes."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,It’s ok,"I feel a little neutral about this product. I didn’t really like or dislike it. Compared to other products, it’s mediocre. I don’t believe that this is worth the amount of money they are selling it for. This is just my opinion. I received this product as a complimentary for testing purposes."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Hydrating cream,"A very nice hydrating moisturizer. I use this more at night right now, as I’m living in a very humid climate and use more gel type moisturizers for daytime.. This is very moisturizing and not heavy feeling."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Great product,I received this product from Influencer and Shiseido for my honest opinion. Love that this cream is a bit more lightweight than the other and doesn’t leave you feeling greasy at all. The smell can probably be a bit much for some but it feels great
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Great cream,First off I love the packaging there is a good weight to the jar and its super cute. I have dry Mature skin and it helps keep my skin soft and hydrated and has helped prevent more fine lines and wrinkles. It also layers well with serums and i have even used as a day cream and make up applied over it well. Definitely will buy again.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,I like the texture/ feel- not heavy. Good absorption into skin for moisturizing purposes! I appreciated it not having an overpowering scent.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Love it.,"I love this stuff. It smells great, not over-powering. It’s super hydrating and you don’t need much — especially if you use a face spray first."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,It's okay but not worth price,I got this product free for testing purposes. I have sensitive dry skin and rosacea so my skin can be picky about products. Most of the time this Moisturizer did the job however on a rare occasion I would get some irritation from it on my skin or if I got it too close to my eyes some extreme watering. I also did not feel like it sufficiently hydrated my skin for the price point. It still left me feeling dry after application.
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Shiseido Essential Energy Hydrating Cream - 50ml,"They sent me another Shiseido cream basically the same as the other, the difference between one and the other is that it has spf 20 sunscreen and the other is a normal cream to moisturize your face. and contains hyaluronic acid red. It works good it hydrates  my skin."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Exception Skin Cream,"I am in love with this cream. As always shiseido uses exceptional packaging. The cream is very dense and a little goes a long way. It saturates the skin pretty quickly, is breathable, and leaves the skin looking kind of oily for a few minutes but it's not oily to the touch. After saturation your skin look like it has a natural glow."
SHISEIDO-Essential Energy Hydrating Cream,USA,Moisturizing,"I really like this product. At first, it felt slightly greasy going on, however, after rubbing it in it no longer felt that way and absorbed well into my skin. This left my skin feeling moisturized. I gave it 4 stars due to the fragrance. I'm not big into heavy fragrance for items going on my face and this could irritate some with a fragrance sensitivity."
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,Singapore,I won't buy again,"I did the Clinique ID analysis online and this product was recommended together with the ID moisturizer.
I thought it would add to the routine, for those days when I'm experiencing a breakout or have the odd stubborn spot, but I was wrong.
I stipped using this because it's an extra step that really doesn't add up to my routine and doesn't help at all with ad hoc treatment of blemishes either."
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,Australia,Haven't noticed much of a difference. ,I have mixed feelings about this one. It has cleared a few blemishes in the past but I feel like I could find something better than this. It's a bit greasy. The amount of product you receive is good. Wouldn't really recommend this to anyone I know as this has been mediocre so far. 
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,Australia,Love,"I really enjoy this product, i pair it with a medicated gel from the chemist as well as hyaluronic acid and a moisturizer and I've noticed a huge difference in my acne"
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,Australia,Completely satisfied!,"I have dry and oily skin with acne and open pores and can't thank this product enough. I have been using it for the last 3-4 months as a moisturizer. Not only does it help with the acne, but also helps in reducing the open pores and redness - and makes my skin look even. Wish they had a bigger packing. "
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,Malaysia,my holy grail,"I’ve been struggling with hormonal acne for so 
long. Tried so many products but none of them did me any good. Finally decided to try clinique’s anti-blemish set and my life changed instantly. My skin is SO much better now. I do get the occasional breakouts once in awhile but goes away after a day or so. 10/10 would recommend !"
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,Australia,10/10,"I can't wait until this product is back! it has helped my husbands skin so much, he has dry combination skin and this honesty has done wonders on his face, "
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,Singapore,It doesn’t work for me,I saw some people review about this product so I bought to try for my acne problem but it doesn’t work for me. Breakout didn’t control at all. It might work for some people but not for me.
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,Malaysia,Perfect for oily skin! ,"Clinique is my go-to brand for skincare. I used to use the whole anti blem range, but now that my skin has improved, I mainly rely on this moisturizer. it's great and lightweight. can be used under make up. "
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,Malaysia,Magic moisturizer ,Another great mosturizer to be praised! It’s amazing and I would never leave my house without applying this mosturizer because it feels great on my skin. Definitely will repurchase! 
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,Malaysia,Ms,Keeps my skin matte throughout the day! One of my favourite skincare from Clinique. Light weight moisturizer for those with oily and acne proned skin 
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,Singapore,Ms,"Not hydrating at all. Broke me out further when used with the entire anti-blemish series. The ingredients seem to be very harsh, especially when used altogether without other skincare to nourish and help skin heal. "
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,Malaysia,Quite okay,"I have few of blemishes and visible pores.. But the results still the same eventhough been using for 2 weeks now. The texture is nice, not so thick, easy to be applied, have cooling sensation. My first and last time using it maybe sorry"
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,Singapore,must have ,Have been using this product for years. It feels very light on the skin and is a must have in my skincare routine. Love it! Highly recommend if you’re not looking for heavy base moisturizer
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,Malaysia,Mrs,Best ever product that I have tried. Really love it. Suitable to my very sensitive skin. Very light texture when applied to my skin. For sure will come back to have this product again next time.
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,Singapore,calm,"It calm, treat my hormone acne and it really prevent new acne! But must use their anti-blemish series to get the max result such anti blemish lotion and clearing gel. Unless all your acne are gone you can just use this moisturiser to prevent future breakout. "
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,Singapore,no go,"Broke me out on my first use. Started to see a bunch of small bumps appearing. Might retry it sometime after. Wouldn’t recommend this, there are more options for acne that seems to work better for me"
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,,Miss ,This is moisturising but i wouldn’t say it makes blemishes disappear straight away. It definitely helps the process go quicker though. I would recommend this if you’re like me and have the occasional breakout or spot and need a fix. 
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,,Helps keep the breakouts controlled,"I use this along with the cleanser in the same range, and I find it works with my skin. It isn't a miracle overnight cream though, and I find it isn't really hydrating, so on alternate mornings or evenings, I will tend to use another hydrating moisturiser, or vitamin C overnight mask to lock in hydration, however I do find it has been more helpful than other products I have tried in the past for my skin type. "
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,,visibly less acne,i have used 3 bottles of it. Visibly less acne but my skin seems to get used to it if I used it for too long.. have to switch it with other moisturizer. It does not moisturize as much as i wish it would.
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish All Over Clearing Treatment,,Doesn't cure pimples,I bought this because it was recommended by a local clinique counter. It is no miracle product unfortunately. It doesn't keep pimples away nor does it cause them to heal faster. I believe results vary depending on skin type and lifestyle as well. 
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Malaysia,water cream ,This is the best lightweight water cream if you’re an oily skinned person and I swear by it ! Not only that it does wonders on your skin and absorbs it really well 
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Singapore,Think is ok,Bought as a gift. He likes it. No scent perfect!
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Malaysia,Ms,"Soothing, hydrating and the texture is super light. Overall worth the price."
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Singapore,Dr Jart,Love all Dr Jart series of mask or moisturising cream. Works really well with effects visible not long after using. Suitable for my sensitive skin & not harsh on sensitive skin & doesn't cost breakout.
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Malaysia,great moisturiser! ,Bought this to try out as I’ve always loved dr jart’s product. And yessss it’s great! Great for morning and night use. Skin feels very hydrated! Make up looks nicer after using this to prep 
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Malaysia,super lightweight,The product is super lightweight and fast absorbing yet it is hydrating enough. I’ve been using it for 2 months and I love it. My skin feels supple after using it.
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Singapore,Nice Hydration Cream,Cream feels really nice on the face and is pretty lightweight. I would use it during the day preferably since I don’t find it hydrating enough to use during the night with my aircon on. Price is pretty affordable and would definitely get it again especially during sales!
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Singapore,ok,"texture is ok. first time buying to try. bought this during promo... 

the min 150 character is irritating... . the min 150 character is irritating.m."
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Singapore,decent hydrator,bought this for my mum - she loves the cute packaging and says that it works well as a day moisturizer - lightweight and absorbs easily into the skin.
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Singapore,hydrating,"there's a certain type of smell which i don't know how to describe. it's like plastic smell. the texture is gel, feels ok to apply. but i have combination skin, and maybe my cheeks are drier, so after applying it, around 1 to 2 hours later, my cheeks will still feel tight, need more hydration. so i guess tis product is not suitable for me. "
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Malaysia,great hydration ,"I love the texture of cream. I m spending most of my time outside in heat, and it’s important for me to use the moisturiser what absorbs greatly, ultra light texture is a must as well. Of coz, most important it does hydrate the skin very well. "
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Singapore,okay ig?,Well just a basic moisturiser. Never reached to it ever since the first time I tried. I use it as a neck moisturiser instead. Was expecting it to be more lightweight since its named ‘water cream’.
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Singapore,Simple but good,It's simple but good. It's oil free so it's suitable to be used during the daytime. 
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Singapore,Dr Jart biome water cream,It absorbs very quickly and does hydrate the skin quite well. The texture is just nice not too thick and you don't feel like there is a layer on your skin after applying. 
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Singapore,Best cream for sensitive skin,"If you have oily sensitive skin, then this is for you. It makes your skin super soft and glowy. It won’t clog the pores. Perfect for summer too. Just love to apply it everyday "
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Singapore,not suitable for sensitive skin,"I was excited to receive the product and the moment I used it, my entire face started itching and now it’s peeling.
Would not recommend for sensitive skin.
Just stick to Ceptaphil lol.
"
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Singapore,Hydrating water cream,"I've got a normal skin without much sensitivity, though can be dehydrated due to constant long hours working inside harsh air-con rooms. Therefore I really appreciate this water cream that keeps my skin hydrated, be it in the harsh aircon rooms or the hot humid weather of SG. I don't really have an issue with this cream smelling funky even though I've used it for about 2 months already. But I do get this funky smell for their sleeping mask. I suspect it could be due to the age of the stocks that we bought. The older the stocks, the chances of getting that funky smell."
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Malaysia,Great as daily moisturizer for normal combination skin type,Great gel type moisturizer. Finished 1 jar for me. good as daily moisturizer as it's lightweight and fast absorb to the skin. Managed to grab it earlier during sales. 
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Singapore,great,"Bought this this during a sale... looking for something light and moisturized at the same time. Have tried it and it is nice and gentle, will buy again. "
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Singapore,water cream ,bought it during promotion period . After friend recommended of how to use this moisturiser I give it a try and I feel is good for air conditioning use which give your skin not feeling dry. can buy and try
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Malaysia,would suits combo or normal skin better,"I have oily combo skin so gel cream would do great on my skin. On the days i have dry patches, this would be fantastic, but on humid days where my oily skin strive, i feel like the moisturiser weren’t fully absorbed. So this isnt Mr Right for me and now am just using this as a neck cream lol! Btw will always love love love Dr Jart masks!"
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Philippines,Works wonders!!,I’ve been using this product for 3 months now and it still hasn’t run out. I can really say that this helped me manage my dry skin and repair my skin barrier. I like the texture as well because it’s not sticky. Would definitely purchase this product again!! ❤️
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Malaysia,Underrated Gem,"I can’t sing this enough praises for anyone who needs a daytime moisturiser that won’t melt off in this humidity. It sinks right in and is super lightweight due to its gel texture and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin, perfect for oily and combination skin too! "
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Malaysia,Cannot stand the scent,Bought this because I was searching for a moisturiser with niacinamide. Watery gel consistency that took time to be absorbed. Works okay as a moisturiser but I really cannot stand the smell. Smelled like seaweed to me. 
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Singapore,Ok but don't like the scent,"I like that the moisturiser is in a cream-gel texture and not heavy. It leaves the skin feeling well hydrated, since my skin is combination and not particularly dry. But I don't like the scent of the product, so will not repurchase again. "
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Philippines,-,I’m a fan of the Dr Jart cicapair line and recently discovered their Vital Hydra Solution line through a sample set. This makes my skin feel soft and moisturizer without being too greasy. I use it for day and night. Love the midnight mask at night as well for extra moisture. 
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Malaysia,Love the texture,"I love how the texture is so lightweight but good enough to hydrate my skin. I use it in the AM everyday. A little goes a long way, one small scoop is enough my whole face. Im pairing it with their night treatment from the same range for the PM everyday. My skin feels so hydrated."
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Malaysia,Not what I expected ,"I’m a huge fan of the Vital Hydra Solution face mask, so I figured the water cream must be just as amazing. But it’s a pretty average moisturiser, smells a bit funky too. Think I’ll just stick with the face masks."
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Australia,best hydrator,"This is my second bottle already. Been using this moisturizer for all seasons. Light-weight, hydrating and gentle on my sensitive skin. With probiotics in the cream refines the texture of my skin and you can feel the skin glowing the next morning. Love it!"
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,New Zealand,love this ,I really love how this product makes me skin feel so hydrated and nourished... will definitely order it again as I think it’s worth it... yes it’s a bit on the expensive side but once you buy this there is literally no going back 
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Malaysia,Product scent changed over time ,"I was really excited to try out the product, it initially had a light fresh scent, however it changed to an unpleasant chemical scent after 1 month. Although the product works well for skin, however am unhappy with how the scent has changed over time "
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Malaysia,Not what I expect ,I was expecting refreshing feeling when I bought this but turns out its quite heavy after applying and have a heavy chemical smells to it as well. Made my face quite oily. 
DR.JART+-Vital Hydra Solution Biome Water Cream,Singapore,Slightly heavy water cream,First time to use. I expected it is watery type because it is called water cream. But it is actually a bit heavy gel cream so my skin cannot adapt very well (mine is partly oily party dry). Maybe it is good for dry skin type.

TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Australia,Super Hydrating,Normally I give all Tarte products 5 stars because they have amazing products. I felt that this oil in particular while very hydrating and great for your skin it went on thick and sticky. Rather than a refreshed feel I felt like I had dipped my face straight into a bucket of grease. 
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Australia,key to moisture ,This product locks in moisture. I use it as a serum. It’s amazing. Especially during the colder months to lock in moisture. I’ve repurchase this for years!!! 
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Singapore,miss ,It was amazing it did take some time to see the results but I was so comfortable after I started seeing the difference and less dry skin and that glow look was appeared  
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,tarte Maracuja Oil - 0.5oz,I tested it in the store and really liked it but the bottle I bought smells rancid.  Perhaps it is supposed to smell like that but I didn’t notice any order after using the tester.  It is being returned.
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Australia,Ms,"I’m so in love wif this oil. In the winter season right now, it keeps my skin supply and healthy looking. I have very sensitive skin and the face that I don’t break out using this oil is legit goals.
I would highly recommend this oil for anyone who is looking at keeping ure skin supply and moisturised esp in the colder months "
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Singapore,didnt really worked ,I guess it just didn’t work for me.. cos i bought it when i saw soooo many good reviews about it but noone ever really said about how it smelled.. i dont really fancy the smell .. make me not reach out for it.. but well it may be good to other skins ! 
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,New Zealand,Not good for oily skin ,After buying it did some research that it clogs pores so didn't use it more than twice. As struggle with harminal acne and have oily combination skin.  It's just lying around gathering dust.

I have Lupus and associated redness on my face, I also have extremely dry skin. I love the way it glides on my face and a little goes a loooong way. I have been using this gem for a month now and I can honestly say, hands down that I notice a huge difference! I’m flowing, my face is soft and smooth and well hydrated with minimal redness!! I’m soooo happy I took the chance and purchased this!!!"

TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,so so,I have tried this maracuja oil. I don’t know. It does make my face feel hydrated but for me it does not give wow factor to me. Definitely not gonna buy it anymore but the bottle is so cute
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,New Zealand,meh,"Not nourishing, or overly hydrating. Has a strange smell? I found when mixed with a moisturiser it seemed to feel a lot nicer on the skin, but I didn’t feel it really absorb when used on its own. Had high hopes for this. "
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,It's great,"The oil is great, I use it on my face and hair but the smell tho, gets a bit musty after a while. I think the product is still great, apart from the smell. "

TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Canada,tarte Maracuja Oil - 1.7oz,I used this product on my face and it cause me to breakout quite a bit which is very rare for me. I decided to use it as cuticle oil just so it doesn’t go to waste.
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Australia,it’s ok,"I wanted to love this product the packaging is beautiful and the oil is good but the smell reminds me of my baby’s bath oil so not so good, glad I only bought the small one to test out first "
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,In my favorites,1 of the best oil or the best so far I use it to my hair and face and the eye cream form this brand is also a plus
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,"Decent oil, smells terrible","Decent oil for face, but I’ve found better. Then, I hated the smell and it lingered all day"

TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,Relaxing fragrance,"Maracuja oil is not just pleasantly fragrant, but it is also good for the skin, it makes my skin feel fresher the next day. I love the fragrance, it is so relaxing. I apply this oil as the last step before my bedtime and use the Jade rollers on my skin."
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Singapore,alright ,"Didn’t really appreciate the smell. However it worked well as an oil which I used on my face to massage at night. To be honest, I stopped using it after awhile due to it’s strong smell. It is a personal preference though"
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,tarte Maracuja Oil - 1.7oz,I use this pretty much exclusively on my cuticles and although expensive I feel it's worth it because it's lasting forever. I use it twice almost every day and there's still quite a bit left.
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,love this!,"I love this so much. I use this for face massage, serum, moisturizer, and even primer. It fills pores nicely if you use the right amount. It makes your  skin glow! "
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,Great product,"The Tarte Maracuja Oil is very light on skin. I applied just little bit of the product, and this one worked well on my skin. As I did a little facial massage, I noticed the product spreads easily and skin absorbed it well. Also,  I didn’t feel my skin was greasy. "
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Australia,gets the job done ,"its a fine oil, gets the job done nothing special though. "
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,Good for all skin type,"this maracuja oil help me to improve the appearance of dark spot & redness . It also promote brighter , firmer & smoother looking skin . Thus , it good for all skin type ."
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Singapore,oil,"This baby gives the skin around my eyes a nice shot of hydration and it absorbs quickly, so I can get on with doing my makeup. It also doesn't make my concealer pill or settle into said lines"
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Australia,Best skin lightening oil,this oil is so good. it hydrates and brightens the skin and acts as an excellent primer. Highly recommend it. After only a few days of use I've noticed the pigmentation on my skin looks lighter.
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,expired oil with horrible smell,"Smells terrible, it’s not worth at all. The moment it starts to smell discard the product.  The actual oil should not smell but shelf life is expired even if it sits in store aisle. I got mine through online purchase this time n that had a smell like expired oil."
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Singapore,Alternative use,"I cant remember why I bought this. Anyways I realised that this is super duper oily, hence I used it to….. Remove my Eyelash Extensions! Yea it works well to melt off the glue of my last few strands towards the end of the shedding season. Well… I think it would be useful as an oil cleanser… I dont actually know what it should be used for by right"
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Australia,Quality but not as practical as the price begs,"Very much a nice quality blow dry but I can't say I can achieve results with this dryer that I couldn't using my $50 hair dryer. Luxurious feeling and the attachments are great, but because my hair is mostly wavy, I have no use for the comb attachment and my long hair (hip length) doesn't really fit in the diffuser. And the box only fits the hairdryer, not the attachments. Took a star away for the price and limited box capacity. "
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Australia,Awful!,"I bought the older version of this product with a different packaging, which I loved it. Hence, I ended up buying again without knowing they changed the formula and now I just feel disappointed. The smell and the oil itself is different and awful.👎"
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Australia,love! ,Really great oil to use everyday I use it on my face every night after I apply my night cream and also rub it into my cuticles leaves my skin super soft and hydrated the next morning without the oily feeling will definitely buy again 
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Australia,Smells amazing!,I like to apply this oil on a clean face at night time and I wake up with glowy and plump skin every day. It smells beautiful and the packaging is just lovely. I will definitely purchase this item again!
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Singapore,make my skin getting moisturizer after next day apply ,Apply it before bed time and it really make my skin getting  moisturizer on the next day. give 4 stars because i don like the smell. it really feel like cooking oil. 
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Canada,tarte Maracuja Oil - 1.7oz,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It is by far one of my favorite oils. I have been using it for 2-3 years now and I'm not tired of it. Put very little cuz very oily.
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,Fowl smell,Smell is absolutely awful. Had to wash off immediately due to strong bitter smell of expired oil.
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,tarte Maracuja Oil - 0.5oz,I didn’t think I would like this product but recently was put on acutane and I’m hooked mixing it with moisturizer and using alone has helped my dry skin so much..highly recommend!!
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,Glowy Oil ,"A lightweight multipurpose oil that works well. Has a slight smell but nothing too noticeable. A little goes a long way, so the bottle will last a while. Just 2 to 3 drops is enough without being too heavy on the face. "
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,Can't live without it!,"This product actually really helped my skin. My skin is significantly softer and smoother since I started using this. I use it together with foundation, and blend it using my beauty blender. It really helps my make up stay."
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,The Best 😍,"Leaves my skin moisturised, looking firmer and brighter. Improves dark spots and redness. By far, this is my 3rd purchase. Suitable for sensitive skin. "
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,the best face oil,"Amazing product! Gives me glowing skin the next morning when used at night. Goes great under makeup as well making application smooth and easy. Overall amazing product. 
"
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,Love,"Have repurchased this several times. Works great! used to have a very, very, very basic beauty regime and this helps lock in the moisture. just a drop or two at night and you're set."
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,Tarte Maracuja oil,"The best face oil and was recommended by a close friend. Eversince I have been repurchase many times whenever got Sales. 
Have been using this oil for more 2years now. 
I also applied on my neck  
Love it very hydrated. "
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,good but too oily for me ,probably not a fan of oil because my hair will stick on my face but overall is well ! mine actually got oxidised? the cap fell of because of the oil and glue so ;( 
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Singapore,Holygrail,Honestly never thought that my oily acne-prone skin needed this. But my skin was getting so dehydrated because of differin (retinoid) and creams don’t work well with my skin in the long run because they tend to leave me with milia seeds. But this maracuja oil changed everything. I use x2 or x3 drops every night after applying differin and my skin got so much better.
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Singapore,Versatile face oil,This face oil is compatible with any skin type and any skincare step you use at. It doesn’t make my skin break out. This oil is not greasy at all and feel like a serum. It moisturise my skin well and this is a must item for air-conditioned bed time. 
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Australia,repurchase and repurchase ,I have receive so many samples of this over the years I finally decided to buy it. It is on the heavier side. It makes my hair oily when I put it on my face as it is slow to absorb. But it’s very very moisturising- I used to give me a boost in winter 
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,New formula greasy,This used to be 100% maracuja oil. Now it has cheap carrier oils and scents. It's so greasy now and smells so strong. Being back the old version!
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Singapore,Marjuca oil,"It’s good to make my make up stick & last long but I would need a oil blotter with me. My skin will turn oily in no time.
So as for a combination like mine, this will suits you if you love an oil glow look. "
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,Reformulated to a worse product than before,"This product has been reformulated which is really annoying. Before, this product was a simple passionfruit oil.  Now it is a fragranced passionfruit oil.  This isn't skincare. This is a perfumed oil which nobody wanted or asked for. Please stop adding fragrance to everything. When people want to use oils they just want to use oils. We just want the antioxidants and linoleic acid. We don't need to smell like an orange and we don't mind the organic smell of the oil.

Thankfully the bottle I just got from my Sephora is the original plain oil. So I'm actually confused about this whole reformulation. Everything I see online shows the fragranced version. I need to find out when this was reformulated."
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,New Zealand,Amazing oil!,I absolutely love this face oil! It feels great on my skin and leaves my face smelling amazing. It soaks in really well if you don’t apply too much. I got the tiny bottle and it has lasted me forever. 
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,Love! ,"Tarte is one of the good brand because they used natural ingredients. And at the same time, suits for my sensitive skin. I have a dry skin and I tried this maracuja oil is superb hydrate. "
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Australia,lush,"Love this stuff to death. Great for dry skin, hair, cuticles. Smells nice in a non-perfumed way. It’s a staple I always need to have on my bathroom counter top. "
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,Love It.,will definitely repurchase. Non greasy. It fade my dark spot and moisturize my skin.
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,Daily staple !,I have been using this oil for years and countless number of bottles ! I use for both my face and body. I have inflamed skin due to sjogren’s and it helps to calm down the extremely red dry patches. I also rub it on my sore muscles as maracuja has a natural healing properties
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Australia,love,"i have dry parts on my face and this oil clears up any imperfections, 10/10 love"
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,tarte Maracuja Oil - 1.7oz,"Like this one but I don't think I'd buy it again. It's a little thicker than I like, but it works great for gua sha. And it lasts forever - I think I've had my bottle for a year and it's only half gone."
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,Easy to absorb,I have been using this maracuja oil for quite sometimes. This is my 3rd purchase. I love using this oil before bed. It makes my skincare routine even better. My skin feel smooth and soft in the morning. 
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Canada,LIFE in a BOTTLE,"I have combination skin, I use this oil daily as a base. I rely HEAVILY on this product when I need to look alive haha. I am someone that is constantly on the go and this product never fails to rehydrate my skin and leave my face dewy/glowing!!! I highly recommend. There is no perfume in this product, it smells how you would think maracuja oil smells, if you are someone that needs a smell to revitalize please do not make the mistake of turning this a way. IT WORKS"
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,being back the old formula,"change the formula back to what it was! why do you need to add fragrance to everything! i love this oil and it’s been a mainstay of mine for years and now it has fragrance? luckily it doesn’t seem to be affecting me much (but i’ve only used the new formula once so far). 

i thought the old scent was perfect. clean and fresh and just the oil. now it smells like an orange. just bring back the original formula please. don’t fix what ain’t broke. 

if you needed to change it, change the packaging or whatever, don’t change the formula of something that works!"
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,Great Mix for Foundation,"I use this oil to mix with my Estee Lauder foundation to give me 1) A dewy finish, 2) More blend-ability, 3) Smooth the small wrinkles.  One drop and it covers my entire face.  Love it.  No smell either."
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,product formula changed,This was a favorite product of mine for many years. I didn't pay attention to the reviews that the formula changed and now I'm regretting it! The product has completely changed and a terrible citrus scent has been added to it. I'm very disappointed I wasted my money on this.
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Canada,no longer the product i loved,"changed the ingredients, how sneaky ! it used to be one main ingredient, maracuja oil. now they’ve added citrus oils which are super irritating for all sensitive skin. returned this time. sad it changed"
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Canada,tarte Maracuja Oil - 1.7oz,"It was a hydrating, thick and very oily oil. I loved how it gave me a nice glow!"
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,brightening magic,"This stuff really helped fade my dark spots and overall brighten my skin tone! As someone with full and dry skin, the glow this left on my skin was great!!! I bought mine about a year ago, so not sure if the formula has changed based off of recent reviews"
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,New formulation,I have been using this for YEARS. It’s been my number 1 holy grail product but unfortunately they reformulated. It now has fragrance. Why? I’m so upset!
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,Please Bring back original formula,This face oil was one of my favorites. It was natural and clean from fragrance and dyes. Now it has added fragrance to it. I do not want to put a unnecessary fragrance on my face especially because my skin gets irritated and is very sensitive. Please bring back the original formula or at least make it available as the non fragrance one for people like me with sensitive skin that can no longer use this product anymore. Thanks.
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,I hope Tarte will change it back,This used to be my favorite skin care product. They changed it and now it’s just not the same. The smell is really not enjoyable. I really hope they change it back because I will no longer buy this.
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,Horrible smell,Horrible smell like cooking oil. Cannot put it on my face
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,CITRUSY,Meh i love this product i’ve used it forever  but i could have done without the citrus fragrance
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Canada,tarte Maracuja Oil - 1.7oz,"I love this, i had never tried it before but was looking for something new. I typically have oily acne prone skin so was a little worried it might cause me to break out or look shiny but it honestly is one of the best oils I’ve ever used. I noticed a great improvement in my skin within a few days and haven’t broke out once *celebrate* i should probably mention i use this as a replacement for moisturizer and only use it in the AM"
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Canada,"Formula change, will not repurchase",BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA. I have been using this for so many years but now due to the added fragrance I am going to be switching to biossance rose oil or the kora organics noni oil. I am so dissapointed that they changed something that worked so well for people with sensitive skin. I will not repurchase until they bring the old formula back.
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,tarte Maracuja Oil - 1.7oz,"I really love this oil. It’s great during harsh New England winters to soothe irritation and flaking, and it doesn’t clog my pores. My only complaint is that the bottle isn’t made well. With every bottle I’ve bought, the wooden shell around the cap has eventually detached from the inner plastic, making it hard to use (difficult to screw and unscrew, sheds flecks of sticky glue, makes the button difficult to press down, sometimes comes apart when trying to press the button). I thinks it’s because it isn’t sealed well, so the little bit of oil that seeps out degrades the glue holding the pieces of the cap together. Not a dealbreaker for me since I love the product so much, but just a heads up to others. Definitely keep it in a little baggie while traveling."
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Canada,tarte Maracuja Oil - 1.7oz,The formula is changed - it’s not the same - BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL FORMULA!!! OLD formula worked wonders on my skin . This new formula broke me out :(
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,USA,tarte Maracuja Oil - 1.7oz,This made my face break out. I don't know why beauty boxes love this brand.
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Australia,amazing ,"My favourite facial oil I’ve tried! Leaves my skin illuminated with a healthy glow. Smells nice and sinks into the skin fast. Highly recommend, this is my second bottle! "
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,Miss,"My mom and sister swears on this product! I bought it for them as they love is so much and how it works wonder on their skin. They said once they use this product, it makes their skin become more smooth. They use this religiously before going to bed. I think everyone should add this in their skincare routine for smooth skin!
"
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Australia,Great all rounder,This product is amazing. So versatile. I use it in the morning before makeup and at night before bed. It’s hydrating and not oily. I’ve repurchased this product for years and will continue to repurchase. I love it. 
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Singapore,HOLY GRAIL,in love with the magic oil and a must have as it prevent breakouts and reduces pimples and scar marks and most importantly keeps the face very clear and clean. and on those days where u are extremely lazy to do the whole night skincare routine this one product alone is just enough
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Malaysia,moisturising your skin,I have an oily skin/combination. But i use this maracuja oil as my moisturizer at nighf routine. So far so good. No breakout or purging. It suits me well. And it gives moisture to my skin. I also use it as a lip balm at night routine. So good! 
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Australia,"soaks in, not heavily fragranced","I've only used this a handful of times but so far so good. it seems to soak in but not completely disappear. a little bit goes a long way so don't use a whole dropper amount! wish it was more fragranced but I know for many people unfrafranced is a plus, it's the only negative I have so far. "
TARTE-Maracuja Oil,Singapore,Maracuja Oil,"Bought it the first time and been using every night before going to sleep. So smooth to the skin and the smell is acceptable, love the fact that they do not need to add artificial scent to this. Will surely purchase again!

FARMACY-Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer,Australia,YASSS,One of the best moisturizers I have ever ever used! Ceramide moisturizers that actually have amazing ingredients for your skin are hard to come by. This one has been a staple in my routine since I first purchased. Have gone through plenty of empty bottles. YAY FINALLY!!
FARMACY-Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer,USA,Just ok,I've used this product for a few months and I find that is just okay. I bought this because I was looking for a moisturizer that would hydrate my dry skin. This product feels like it just sits on top of my skin. It doesn't feel like it seals in moisture as sometimes my skin would still feel dry after applying. Although this product was just okay on my skin I do love the packaging and the magnetic spoon this comes with. This spoon is perfect for preventing bacteria on your fingers from entering the jar since you can use the spoon for more product instead of your fingers.
FARMACY-Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer,USA,Amazing for dry skin!!,This was complimentary from Farmacy Beauty.I have loved this product!! I suffer from dry skin especially during this time of year. The driest part of my face is always on my chin. This product has been amazing for my dry skin. If you are like me and suffer from dry skin I definitely recommend this. It is worth the price. A little goes a long way. I think the jumbo size is better for the price and for the amount of product you get.
FARMACY-Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer,USA,Farmacy Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer - 50ml,"First Off I Love That It Comes With A Little Spatula So You Don't Put Your Hand In The Jar The Packaging Is So Lovely I Don't Care For The Smell But Once It's On Your Face You Don't Smell It It's Light On My Face In My Skin Felt So Different Immediately In My Face Had A Glow Which I Loved

FARMACY-Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer,USA,Farmacy Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer - 50ml,This product is ok. Not terrible but also not a must have.

FARMACY-Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer,USA,Farmacy Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer - 50ml,I received a sample of this and used it today. All I can say is wow!

FARMACY-Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer,USA,This replaced my old favorite ceramide!,"Ceramide moisturizers are my preferred moisturizers because of the emollient,soothing results after retinols. This is, however, my first time using Farmacy Honey Halo Ultra-Moisturizing Ceramide Moisturizer. 
        First, the packaging from the outer box to the heavy glass jar are high quality and well designed. I like the honeycomb shape of the jar.I appreciate that a metal spatula is included and it attached to the metallic lid! Great for keeping the moisturizer hygienic and tidy. The design gives me modern farmhouse/farmer's market vibes which is an aesthetic I like. 
        As for the moisturizer itself, it smells like honey. I don't mind the scent but those sensitive to it might. The natural scent doesn't linger too long after applying, though. 
        The moisturizer has a thickened,whipped butter texture. When I rubbed a small pea size dab into my hands, the moisturizer becomes creamy. It's so easy to glide onto my skin. It absorbed into my skin so well, leaving it feeling nourished,gently sealed and protected.  No greasy nor oily residue on my hands,face nor pillow. The next morning, my skin still feels so soft and hydrated despite using a drying retinol. My face looks healthy and glowing. I really like Honey Halo moisturizer! It's going to replace my current ceramide moisturizer for several reasons: It works slightly better, it's easier to find, and it has a better price point per oz.

It's a nice glass container with a wood type lid that has a magnetic spatula that stays on the lid. Very useful so you do not lose your spatula. The opening of the container is a little so small so I hope when it starts to get low, I can still access the rest of the product easily with the spatula.  I really loved the texture. It was a nice cream texture and it absorbed into my skin really well. My skin soaked it all in and was very moisturized. It has helped with dry flakey patches I have had and will be a blessing come wintertime! It says its fragrance free but there is a hint of scent which I'm sure is natural.

FARMACY-Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer,USA,Farmacy Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer - 50ml,I received this complimentary from Farmacy in exchange for my honest review. First of all the packing is not only nice looking but the way the spatula magnitizes to the top I love. I can't tell how many times I've misplaced the spatula.

FARMACY-Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer,USA,Farmacy Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer - 50ml,I received this complimentary from Farmacy in exchange for my honest review. This moisturizer is different it feels both thick and moisturizing yet lightweight. I know thay doesn't make sense but it does! The texture initially feels thick but when applied to my face it's feels its not thick. This is the perfect moisturizer for me especially since I use adapelene and it's starting to get cold.
FARMACY-Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer,USA,Apply generously and be wowed,"I'm a big fan of the daily green moisturizer from farmacy, but have dry skin so I wanted to try their other offerings. This adorable frosted glass jar was a great way to try this moisturizer and it performs really well. It's got a rich, creamy texture that looks and feels like butter, with a slight honey scent. I find that this performs best when applied generously. Because of my experience with daily greens going a long way and because of the texture, my first few tries of this I applied a smaller amount and wasn't wowed. It felt good, but not great--creamy and emollient but not hydrating or super long lasting. Then I saw some video reviews where people were applying much more, and that made all the difference--when applied generously my face felt way more hydrated and the moisturizer stayed on all night. My spouse has combo skin and loves this even more than I do--I've since bought two full size jars and the jumbo size, so this has become a staple in our household."
FARMACY-Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer,USA,LOVEEE!!,"I am a huge Farmacy fan and this moisturizer felt delicious on my skin. I am a sucker for packaging, and this packaging is beautiful!! I absolutely love how it comes with a mini spatula to scoop the product and so that you never lose it they made the spatula magnetic to the top of the product.  I used this product at night and my skin was VERY hydrated in the morning. This product was gifted to me by Farmacy Beauty but wow I love this moisturizer!"
FARMACY-Honey Halo Ultra-Hydrating Ceramide Moisturizer,USA,Not for my skin,"The packaging looks beautiful and magnetic spatula is very convenient – you will never loose it. The cream is thick and has a light honey scent. It contains great ingredients such as honey, propolis, and shea butter. I thought it would be great to use it as a night cream, but it didn’t work for my combination skin. I applied a very small amount of cream, it melted fast, but did not absorb into my skin. Eventually it dried out and created a film on the top of the skin. Then my face became very itchy, and I had to cleanse it. It was difficult to get rid of that sticky layer. I had to double cleanse my face to remove it. I think I had a problem because of sensitivity of my skin. If your skin is not sensitive, it may work well for you. I got the Honey Halo ultra-hydrating ceramide moisturizer complimentary from Farmacy Beauty."

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Ultra Glow Mask With Vitamins C & E,USA,use as an overnight mask and not a one time use,"this mask does make your skin glow but when reading the directions, i had used it as a quick mask and not overnight. it implies to apply a thick layer and use a cotton pad to remove. while removing the mask for the most part it did come off easily, but some areas the product rolled onto itself making it a hassle to remove. ended up having to use a wet cotton pad and came off a lot easier. will have to try as an overnight mask and may not see this issue. the product alone does a good job, feels super refreshing and does help your skin glow"
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,Canada,My new night cream,I'm 51 and only have some fine lines but I noticed recently that the lines on my forehead were more visible. I woke up this morning and they were less apparent! I love the way the cream feels and clearly it's working.
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,Canada,The best retinol formula for beginners,"My skin is adapted to retinol, and I can see less hyperpigmentation the next morning. I have a smoother skin and my skin break out less since I use it daily. I think it is because the retinol controls the sebum production. It has a lightweight texture, so it’s very suitable for oily skin."
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,Singapore,Absorbs pretty quickly,A little pricey but still cheaper than some other brands out there. it absorbs pretty without feeling sticky after application. This might be one of my favourite night moisturiser and may purchase again 
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,Singapore,Works for me (oily acne-prone skin) ,"I’ve been using it about 3 times a week for about 3 months now and I’m seeing a difference! My face feels smoother and tighter in the morning. Love it and will repurchase! Wish it was cheaper though :( 
"
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,Malaysia,too thick for a humid weathered countries ,"If you have had use retinol before and your skin is used to it , this retinol cream may not be enough for you. It is very moisturising but too thick for my liking in a hot humid country. So I usually only use it at night. "
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,Canada,worth it,"I was worried about using retinol because of things I’ve read regarding purging or peeling. I’ve been having terrible breakouts and decided that hey, what’s the worst this can do? Hesitating on the price tag made me postpone with purchasing. I am so happy i took the plunge. It doesn’t make my oily skin worse, acne is getting better and I’m noticing dark spots fading already. Skin is feeling fantastic and life is great. If you’re worried about buying, dont."
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,Singapore,one of the best ,"4th time getting this product.  It’s not as dry as drunk elephant, can be used regularly as a night moisturiser. More suitable for my skin and it has a nice smell. "
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,Canada,Just A Really Good Product,"Next to A313 (which I haven't been able to get my hands on in a while in Canada!), this is the best retinol I've tried. It's super gentle but it's effective. As with all retinols, it's a slow burn before you really see what it can do, but I'm beyond happy with this. Will repurchase and make my wallet cry."
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,It's exactly what it markets itself to be!,I love this retinol moisturizer! It's gentle but powerful enough to make an impact on my 30 year old skin. It doesn't make my skin feel dry and flaky like other retinol creams. You can use additional moisturizer but the product alone is sufficient.
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,Malaysia,thumbs up,"absolutely love this retinol cream. Does not irritate my skin, but did cause mild dryness and flakiness which slowly goes off after a week or so. Pair it with  a hydrating serum and it will leave your skin smooth with improved texture"
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Very happy!,"Initially I was nervous buying a retinol cream that i wasn’t sure would work for me, especially at this price point but I’m happy to say I was very satisfied with this retinol! Pretty nice smell too! I have been using it sense September of 2020 and I have noticed a clear difference in my skin. I’ve always had acne issues, but sense I’ve started using this at night, paired with origins “checks and balances” face wash twice daily (sometimes once if I’m in a hurry) I believe it has helped my acne immensely! I got this just to try and stay ahead of aging but I was pleasantly surprised with the other positive effects this product has had on my skin! I’ve also noticed a lot less blotchiness on my face as well.I was skeptical because it seemed like no change for a while but I stuck with it and I was very happy I did. I will try other retinol creams to compare but overall I really did like this retinol night moisturizer!"
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,More radiant skin after 3 weeks!,"I saw positive changes in my skin after just 3 weeks!

I have tons of scarring from over a decade of cystic acne (I’m 26), and I’m finally feeling good about my skin. Most of it is hormonal, and I have normal to dry skin, but I noticed that the texture has smoothed out and my skin looks more radiant after adding this to my routine! My pores are smaller, and I don’t get new breakouts until around my cycle. 
I’ve used the Drunk Elephant retinol, and it made my skin peel and red and uncomfortable, even with added moisturizers. 
I use this every other night after cleansing with YTTP superfood cleanser and applying the Inkey hyaluronic acid (I use that morning and night and highly recommend). Then I use the YTTP adaptive deep moisture cream to seal it all in. I’d recommend all of those products because my skin is better than it’s been since before puberty."
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Might be better than my prescription retinol?,I liked this product. I felt like it decreased my pore size as well. I recently started using prescription retinol and I think this might have worked better. I’m going to continue using the retinol for a few more months but will probably go back to this product.
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,Canada,holy dryness!,"Holy drying!! Haha.. been using this for a week now and only applied twice but make sure you get a good moisturizer to go with it cause my skin has never felt tighter or dryer. I’m guessing this is just what I need to go through in order to see the benefits but this is annoying. Overall, it’s working. I feel the tingling when it’s applied and mild redness but my skin definitely feels clear just super super dry right now"
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,Canada,wowwww!!,"Im in love! Im 35 and I have hormonal acne since 3 years and horrible scar on my chin. OMG. After 2 weeks I see improvement! Less bumps, less brown spots... I almost cry this morning when I saw my clear skin!! Life changing for me! Ive been for 3-4 days in “purge” (flaking and few red bumps) but it worth it!! Im sooo happy!! Need to be layered for me with Korres and I do not apply around my eyes."
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Wonderful!,Absolutely love! I’ve already seen a difference in my skin. It looks much more hydrated and tighter
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,Canada,"10/10, Exactly what I was looking for","Effective, and not overly drying. My skin is very sensitive and I’ve been struggling to find a retinol that works for me. I was originally recommended the Drunk Elephant 1% retinol and it made my skin red, raw and peel. I was worried this would do the same, but was pleasantly surprised. The moisturizer in the product is so nice, and after 1 week of use I am already starting to see positive changes in my skin. I have added an extra moisturizer & oil to my routine to combat any additional dryness throughout the day."
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,Malaysia,not for me...,"This retinol moisturizer doesn’t really work for me, it caused breakout every time I applied it. Sunday Riley works better for me, I can see a distinct difference when I change from this to SR. I’ve given this to my mom instead hoping it works for her..."
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Origins from 2004 to now - still great,"I loved origins in my late teens, early 20s. Now firmly in my 30s, I took a chance on this retinol based on previous loyalty to the brand. I was not disappointed. Previously, Philosophy Help Me was my go to retinol but it was sold out. This product is as effective and more bang for the buck. It goes on very smooth and comfortably (no burning). I wake up to clear, smooth skin and diminished acne/bumps. I'm about to order my second tube - it's getting it done.Latent loyalty rewarded."
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,Canada,Better than Drunk Elephant,"I picked this up as I ran out of my usual retinol and they had not yet started carrying the product line (Inkey List) and The Ordinary retinol 1% was, again, out of stock. Honestly, it's one of my favourites now. SO MUCH BETTER than the Drunk Elephant which causes cystic acne in spots when I use it. Is it worth the money compared to Inkey List? Maybe not, but it's damn good and I can use it nightly. Doesn't cause me to break out at all, but I do wish they would disclose the percentage of retinol in the product."
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,Malaysia,Nice Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,i always love Origins products. I have repurchased this retinol moisturizer for the third times and i really cant stop using it. i like the effect of it being an age eraser that reduce the wrinkle formation.
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Game Changer for Skin Texture!,"This stuff is AMAZING. I've been using it for about a month now and it has completely changed the texture of my skin. I'm 31 and my skin just started looking way less smooth lately, and nothing else was working. I tried the different acids, lotions, etc. and this was the only thing that made a difference. I did the one day on, one day off for 2 weeks, and now I'm doing 2 days on, 1 day off. The only peeling I'm having is around my mouth area and it's super mild. Love this product and I'll definitely continue to use it!"
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Best Retinol I've Ever Used,"I've been using various different retinol night creams for years, and this is far and away the best I have ever used. I was pleasantly surprised because I've found that a lot of Origins moisturizers I've used in the past leave me oily/ shiny and clog my pores. Not the case here. 

I don't have very sensitive skin, and my skin did go through a peeling phase for the first two weeks or so of using this nightly (thank you, quarantine), but it was so worth it. It has made my skin so smooth and soft and radiant, so much so that several people have commented how great my skin looks, and this is the only new thing in my regime. It's effective at keeping fine lines at bay around my eyes/forehead/mouth, which all retinols should do, and is overall nourishing. I use it on my face/neck/decolletage. This is the only Plantsciption product in my regime, and it has be seriously considering buying more of them next time I need to replenish my serum, etc. 

Smells great. Lasts a good amount of time (4 months ish). Makes your skin glow. I'm a believer."
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,Singapore,normal ,didn't see much difference after continuous use. love origins but this is not one of my favourite product esp considering the price. will use other retinol products like Sunday Riley and pair with separate mosituriser for improved effect
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Origins Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,"I’ve been using this for about a month now. My skin is definitely going through some purging / flaking, but it’s been manageable. It’s also feels tight if I don’t layer on the moisture in the morning. The texture is really nice and it’s super moisturizing. I’m curious to see how my skin looks in another month or so. This is the first time I’ve consistently used a retinol product (tried prescription tretinoin and the irritation was too extreme for me)"
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Will buy again,"Feels good on my skin, not greasy. However I have sensitive skin so have to alternate usage as advised. Been using 2 weeks now and my skin texture feels so much smoother!"
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Origins is the best,I was searching for a retinol due to the recent news of neeeeeding one as a part of my night routine. I use the origins frothy face wash so I decided to try this. It’s definitely expensive but worth it. I have not had any negative issues (redness/breakouts/dryness) and I have seen a clearness in my skin. Glad I tried one and loved it!
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Origins Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,"I bought this for my mom because she loves Origins skincare. She has been loving it! She has a very simple skincare routine, and this has become a part of her routine. She says she feels like she's noticed a difference. It is pricey, but most retinols are."
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,Canada,OMG!,"You guys! you have to give this a try! I'm surprised that there so few reviews for this product. First of all I have a acne prone sensitive combination skin. I have been using this product for 2 month now and I can see the difference very clearly. even after 2 weeks in, people started giving me compliments on my skin! I know! My skin glows and is soo soft and smooth, there is no irritating scent to it and absorbs to the skin with no stickiness. After washing my face, first I apply a toner, my serum, then this product only at night. Highly recommend it!"
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Origins Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,I have normal to dry skin and I saw an immediate difference after one night of use.  Skin appeared more radiant and youthful.
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Origins Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,"My first time using retinol in my life and I’m glad that I picked the right one! Must follow the instructions on how to use the product, for the first two weeks, use every other day, so the second time I used this product, my skin started peeling, it stopped peeling after the first week of using the product, my skin feels so soft and radiant! 
I was surprised that even with the peeling, my skin was not red or irritated, not sure how it works, but this retinol did an amazing job. Dark spots almost invisible, pores are also invisible and expression lines are gone. Love it and will buy it again because it worth the $$$
Just for a full disclosure, I’m in my early 30th."
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Origins Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,"I’ve been using this product for 2.5 months now and really love what it’s done to my skin. I’m in my late 20s and just began adding retinol to my skincare routine last year. This is my second product and is likely what I’ll be sticking with for a while! The tube has great value and lasts a long time when used as directed. After washing my face and applying serums, I warm a pea-sized amount on my fingertips. I tap the product into my skin, starting with my areas of concern (for me, my forehead and laugh lines). I experienced a little tingling when I started the product, but I eased it into my routine by using it every other night for 2 weeks and found that my skin adjusted quickly. Thanks to the other ingredients in this cream, I haven’t experienced irritation or dryness, which was a concern with my fair and sensitive skin. I follow with a thick but mild night cream and have loved my results since day 1!"
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Wonderful natural retinoid,"This is a fantastic product.  Truly the first product that I have seen a huge difference in my skin.  I’m 43 years old and nothing I’ve ever used has worked like this.  I noticed the dimethicone comment here and reached out to Origins about it.  I wish they’d take it out, but I can not deny what it’s done for my skin.  You will breakout when first starting a retinoid.  It’s called purging, so please don’t be discouraged.  I use it every other night.  My skin is constantly exfoliated, softer and clearer.  

I’m also trying herbivores natural retinoid and can comment on that after some time.  I went through a whole bottle of this origins and feel like I can’t live without it.  It’s amazing!"
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,AMAZING!!!,"This product is fabulous!! Gentle, yet very effective. It provides excellent hydration and leaves my skin looking bright and refreshed with improved texture! Some people said this caused breakouts, but that is what retinol is actually supposed to do if you have acne/acne-prone skin - these breakouts happens with both over the counter and prescription retinol products because it is exfoliating your skin at a deeper level, so it brings anything clogged back up to the surface. Breakouts should go away within 1-2 weeks. I didn't experience breakouts with this product even though I'm acne-prone and overall I'm very impressed with the results!"
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Erase lines and glow,"I never write product reviews but I feel the need to for this one. I am a 41 year old woman with 2 kids and a full time job. I drink more wine than I should and I don't sleep enough. That said, I have good genes so the deep lines haven't developed yet. At this point in my life, my concerns are even skin tone, elasticity, and fine lines. This stuff if amazing. I started using it every 3 days with an added layer of moisturizer after and worked my way up to every other day in the past month. Its safe to use every day but I feel that every other day is enough. My face glows, the lines on my forehead have disapeared and my face feels smoother than ever before. This is the first product I have used from this brand and it was an amazing introduction. I will have to try others."
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,,Love it!!!,Love this product from origins! Smells a little funky but it faded away after a short while. Skin was glowing the next morning and scars looked lighter. But good to use a hydrating serum before the moisturizer esp when sleeping in air conditioned room cos it’s not v hydrating. 
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,,Good product,"I heard a lotta good reviews about this product so I bought it to try it out. So far, it’s very nourishing for my skin and I don’t feel as flaky as before. "
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Origins Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,After the third time using this product my skin changed almost instantly. Seems smoother and plumper.
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,READ INGREDIENTS- DO YOUR RESEARCH,"There are multiple ingredients that should NOT be in skincare. There are lots of stripping ingredients in here, some of which are listed before retinol. Dimethacone is NEVER something you should have in your skincare. It is usually used in primers for its pore filling properties...who wants that with skincare? All that does is PREVENT things from sinking into your skin. A sad realization because I wanted to purchase this product but I will have to find something else. Keep in mind that the green checkmark doesn't mean all the ingredients should be in your skincare."
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Made me break out,"I’ve used retinol products for about two years now. I was so excited for a retinol in a moisturizer. Consistency was perfect. But whenever I used it (over night), I woke up with a couple breakouts. (My skin isn’t sensitive at all btw). Had to return"
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,hydrating and result producing!,"I am OBSESSED with this product! I was breaking out like crazy and I had a lot of really horrible acne scarring and literally within two days I could already see a difference in my face. I love how this is hydrating as well and seriously, you don’t need much! They recommend a very small amount and honestly, a small amount goes a long way! I have sensitive skin and dermatitis rosacea and this product has not made it worse or irritated my skin at all!"
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,i love it !,I’ve experience some dryness on my cheeks but its totally normal first time using retinol. So far i do like it.
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Makes my skin glow,"I am in my mid 30s and it is just starting to be time for me to incorporate a retinol cream into my routine. I have very pale combination skin that is prone to hormonal jawline acne and is dry but prone to congestion.
The first thing you notice when using this product is the smell. It is light but sweet and maybe a bit flowery. It dissipates quickly after applying this product.
The bottle tells me to use a pea sized amount, but I found it a bit hard to distribute that to my whole face so I have been using about a kidney bean sized amount every night. 
My skin tends to be on the sensitive side, so I am SO happy that I have suffered no irritation from this product. It absorbs very quickly.
After using this product for 9 consecutive nights now, my skin seems to glow. The just-starting-to-appear lines around my mouth are GONE. I have some sun damage on my cheeks, and the appearance is massively diminished. Almost invisible. I can't believe that such a gentle product can be so effective!
My skin did not break out any more than usual. When my hormonal acne appeared  it cleared several days faster than usual. The only difference to my routine has been this product. I'm very pleased with this purchase. I would rebuy this product."
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,"Nice, gentle retinol","This is my first time using a retinol product and I've been loving it so far!

ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,My retinol holy grail!,"I have oily/combo skin that is a little sensitive. Since I'm turning 30 soon I wanted to add a retinol product into my skincare routine.  I've tried other retinol and phyto-retinol products that have irritated my skin and made me break out. I have a few Origins products so when they came out with this retinol, I wanted to see how my skin would react. 

After 2 weeks of use, doing the recommended every other night application, my fine lines around my mouth, forehead, and neck have drastically diminished. Another added bonus is that it's helped minimize my large pores from my oily skin. The application I've found most effective is putting a pea-sized amount into my hands, rubbing the product into my hands, and then lightly patting the product onto my face and neck. Love this product and will definitely repurchase."
ORIGINS-Plantscription Retinol Night Moisturizer with Alpine Flower,USA,Breakouts,"I really liked this at first. It applies very smooth, aside from dimethicone—most ingredients seemed like a positive. Unfortunately, every time I used it at night I woke up with the next morning with new/more pimples. I was trying to chalk it up to something else in my skin care routine but I eliminated this and had to accept it’s the culprit. I returned. :("

I can’t use night creams as they are too rich for my skin else it will cause congestion or oil seeds.

ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,Canada,Origins High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,"Years ago this used to be one of my holy grail products and one of the only things that evened out my skin texture--unfortunately they've since reformulated it and it just does not work for me anymore. My skin leans dry and sensitive, especially in the winter, and this is MUCH too drying for daily use. I found myself wanting to reapply within a few minutes of putting this on because my skin felt tight and dry, which of course only further dried it out. I am giving this three stars because I assume it still has the benefits it used to give me with respect to evening skin tone and texture, but beware--would not recommend if you have anything close to dry skin."
ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,Malaysia,nah....,Didn't see much difference on my skin. I have normal combination skin.

ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,Malaysia,Good but could be better,Had somewhat high hopes for this night cream but it didn't meet my expectations. I saw very minimal effects in terms of skin texture so don't hope for it to help loads if you are looking to solve some texture issues on your skin.

I feel like my skin looks vibrant right after using, for the rest of the evening, but really no difference the next morning... and no consistent improvements for long term use."

My skin is more glowy, and I can see a slight change in the fading of my acne scars. it’s a great before bed moisturizer! I did look at some of the reviews on here and noticed people saying it caused them to “break out” please do more research on a product before you give something a bad review AHA’s can cause your skin to “purge” which is temporary acne (your pores are clearing out the junk!) it can last from 2 to 4 weeks. 
Acids, vitamin C serums and retinoids can all cause purging. Purging is an initial acne breakout that can occur when you're starting a new active skincare product—one that causes your skin cells to turn over more quickly. Products that can trigger purging include: Hydroxy acids (AHAs, BHAs and PHAs) and fruit acids

My skin has been purging but I know that if from the effects of the acids in this products, looking forward to see how my skin looks in a month or two!! :) if you are not okay with the purging process & being patient you probably shouldn’t buy this!"

ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,Canada,Great Moisturizer,"I first began using this moisturizer about a year ago and have not been disappointed. I have tried the regular version as well but settled on the oil-free one because it's lighter but still hydrates without clogging my pores or feeling heavy. I use this at night; after cleansing my face I use the Ordinary Glycolic Toning Solution, then the Sunday Riley CEO Glow Oil and finally, this moisturizer. It's a routine that works well for me and I have no complaints. 
I wake up with smooth and healthy skin which is soft to the touch. Unless they change up the formula (I hope not) or my skin's needs change, I'll be repurchasing this again and again."

ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,Canada,Good at first but increasing sensitivity,"I really liked this at first - I love the citrus smell and the smooth, hydrated results - and it seemed a lot gentler than a lot of AHA products. But it's very oil-based and relies on a lot of citrus oils - I could never use it more than 2-3 days in a row without a risk of breakouts and sensitivity. The nightly refining oil is a better bet - it's a lighter oil with more varied ingredients and it absorbs really well."

I used to use the other version of this cream and loved it, but I hadn’t had it in about 6 months to a year and kind of forgotten about it plus the other one is a little heavier since it isn’t oil free.   I decided to bite the bullet and try this one and I am so glad I did.  I wake up and my skin is even and glowing.  I’ve seen a difference in tone and the size of my pores and it’s only been 2 weeks.  Some nights I’ll forget to do skincare but since I’ve bought this I haven’t forgotten once because I look forward to putting this on and the results it gives!

ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,USA,Origins High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,"Absolutely love this moisturizer in the winter. The first jar I bought was of the regular Night-a-mins and a little went a long way, but I noticed the oil was starting to make me break out so I switched to this oil free version and it is just as good as the original. I only use this at night and I usually only use it 2-3 nights a week. If your face gets dried out in the harsh winter get this stuff. It seriously is the best."
ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,,Love the scent,"Great product from Origins! I love it, it is light-weight, not oily and improves the overall condition of my skin. I use it twice a week at night, the only down side is the price, nonetheless I will repurchase! "
ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,,"It's okay, not great","I love the soft texture which absorbed very quickly into the skin. The skin felt a bit refreshed upon application. However, it did not do much for my skin."
ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,USA,Not for acne-prone skin,"I really liked this product the first few nights I used it. 
It made my face feel very soft in the mornings. 
However after using this product, I noticed that it did cause me to grow some pimples. If it weren't for this, I would've really liked this product."

ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,USA,Gentle and Effective Resurfacing Cream,I've only been using this for about 2 weeks but I am already noticing a difference in the texture and overall brightness of my skin. I really like that this is a gentle resurfacing cream and not too harsh. I have very sensitive skin and this is a great night cream for moisture and resurfacing. I can't wait to see what kind of results I get after using this for a month.
ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,,Origins product is the best ever!,"All the while, I am using Origins products.

ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,,not my favorite,"Bought this to try but don't think will repurchase again. The scent is strange, and quite overpowering. Texture wise it's smooth but leaves the skin sticky after application. I only tried using at night since it leaves the skin too sticky for day use. Have not notice any difference it makes for my skin though. "
ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,USA,Great night cream,I've been using this as a night cream for years and find its moisturizing without making my skin oily or causing breakouts.  Would also recommend for use on longer flights as it keeps my skin from drying out!
ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,USA,Origins High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,"This moisturizer is the worst smelling product I have ever used - it reminds me of the scent of leather mixed with oranges or a very bad air freshener. I wanted to love this clean moisturizer, but the scent was over-powering and so unappealing. Even my family members didn't want to be around me when I used it and it gave one of them a headache whenever I had it on. It left my skin very shiny and greasy. I did like how soft it left my skin the next morning and all the clean ingredients, but the smell is just too horrible. I hope they eventually reformulate it with a more fresh and soft scent."

ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,USA,Origins High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,I love this moisturizer. It is oil free and is light weight.  The consistency is gel so it’s not meant to be a heavy cream moisturizer.  It’s helped me with my acne paired with a mandelic acid toner.  Nice scent too and I’m usually opposed to scent in my skin care but this one does not irritate my sensitive skin.
ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,USA,IDK.,This isn't for sensitive skin. It tingles and leaves my skin a little red. smells great but that's about it.
ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,USA,"The perfect evening cream, smell and all.","This is my go-to evening cream. It's super light, so a little bit goes a long way and it never feels heavy or greasy on my face. One tub lasts forever! Also, the smell reminds me of a chocolate somehow...in a good way. My face feels so much more hydrated afterwards as a result, and it doesn't lead to crazy breakouts."
ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,,bad product,it made my face broke out with a gazillion pimples. i do not recommend this product to acme prone skin. it will make ur face worse. it dries out the skins and the smell is very weird
ORIGINS-High-Potency Night-A-Mins™ Oil-Free Resurfacing Cream with Fruit-Derived AHAs,,Nice,abit too pricy.....does its job...... nothing to complain about.....might purchase again in the future. good brand and the cream doesn't feel harsh at all. quite smooth.
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Australia,moisturiser,"this moisturiser is extremely lightweight and leaves my skin feeling dry 30 minutes after applying. it might be a good product for someone with oily skin, but not for someone like me with dry skin"
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Malaysia,holy grailll,its functioning.... I can see huge different after few times of apply it ok my skin. I am not regretting what I purchased and will definitely re-buy it againnn
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Singapore,The Inkey List - Symbol Brightening Moisturiser,Am looking for a new moisturiser and was recommended The Inkey List - Symbright Brightening Moisturiser. Have yet to use it but hopefully it will work on my combination skin. 
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Malaysia,love it !!! ,Super smooth and matte texture. I love this moisturizer which not make oily or sticky. First time I feel my skin hydrated without feel heavy and oily. Worth to buy 
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,New Zealand,Nice moisturiser,I like this moisturiser. Does make my skin brighter under my CC cream and oil. Lovely texture. Only need a small amount as it spreads really nicely xxx
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Singapore,love it,The cheapest product in sephora but i love the  consistency and how it feels on my skin! Luckily my skin isnt picky and tend to like cheaper products more. 
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Australia,The Inket List Affordable Moisturiser,"Good 
affordable moisturiser.  I use it morning and night and it leaves my skin feeling  hydrated. Makes makeup application smoother and doesnt leave the skin oily.
"
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,New Zealand,anonymous ,I absolutely love this brand! This moisturiser feels nice on my face and is great under makeup. I use this as well as the cleanser as my two main skincare staples. 
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Australia,Recommend it ,I really like many products of this brand and this moisturizer is not an exception! The texture is really light and there is no mask effect on the skin after using it.
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Australia,Eh,"Can’t say i’ve really noticed much of a difference using this product. It’s not bad, but I don’t find it overly moisturising and I haven’t noticed any brightening effect so far "
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Singapore,miss ,This is quite a light moisturizer. On dry skin it isn’t quite moisturising enough but I can mix in a serum with it.  I probably wouldn’t buy it again? But it is quite nice to use every day. 
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Australia,nice but not for me,"Very nice but not for me. I found the texture of this moisturiser just didn’t work well for my skin compared to the B,C&E moisturiser. Does give a nice glow"
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Singapore,Not for Oily Skin,"The moisturizer did not work well for my oily sensitive skin. IT just did not feel like it was absorbed into my skin, i could feel the moisturizer just sitting there taking up real estate without doing anything. "
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Malaysia,Bright skin,"This cream is supposed to make your skin brighter and less scar but I don’t see any effect after using for a month, might need to use longer. However have to mention that it does make my skin smooth and hydrated."
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Malaysia,Nice to have ,Easy to apply and doesn’t leave white cast if used minimally. 
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Singapore,Doesn’t feel like a moisturizer ,"A bit disappointed with this product as I don’t feel the moisturizing or brightening effect at all. The product leaves a white cast right after application, but will be gone after 30 seconds or so. No breakouts or sensitivity after using though."
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,USA,Blessedly Basic,"I badly wanted a moisturizer that didn't have dimethicone, shea butter, or fragrant oils, and I wanted something thinner than the vani cream I use at night. This checks those boxes. This applies nicely immediately after washing my face, or over serums. I've had no issues with it under sunscreen or makeup. 

I haven't noticed a major brightening effect after using a full bottle, but that's not what I bought it for, so I don't mind. (There's maybe a slight shimmer to the lotion itself due to reflective ingredients, though.) It has a really natural finish; not flat/matte or overly glowy/shiny. 

It doesn't seem to break me out, dry me out, make me more oily/shiny, or otherwise change my skin texture, which means it's doing its job: keeping my skin and moisture barrier stable.

This wouldn't be something I'd grab for repairing my skin, deep moisturizing, or fading scars/marks, but there are other products for that. This is great for staying the course and layering up. I think it will be especially great when summer comes around. 

My acne-prone skin hates most moisturizers on the market. They sting or cause breakouts or both. But, I still need a layer to keep my skin from getting tight and dry. Finding a basic, affordable product like this has been awesome."
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,USA,The Inkey List Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,"It was nearly okay, I had high hopes after seeing reviews, but I feel like it made me break out. Keep in mind I have oily skin, but it did say it works well with it too :/"
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Malaysia,Does its job,Pleasantly surprised by this product! It does help to maintain moisture on my skin. I apply this on my neck and it works really well. 
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Australia,Fab fab fab!,"I was quite sceptical about trying this brand purely based on the pricing and size. However, this product is by far one of the best moisturisers I have tried. Mix this up with the other serums etc and you will feel like your skin just had a facial. "
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,USA,"not bad, not great",Purchased this because I was looking for a more affordable moisturizer. It’s pretty good for the price point my skin definitely feels more hydrated but I find other products to be more luxurious feeling/effective
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,New Zealand,nice and affordable ,"really like this moisturiser and i swear by the inkey list, all their products are so affordable and good quality. i definitely recommend this moisturiser:)))


"
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,USA,The Inkey List Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,No smell. Doesn’t break me out. Little thicker than my summer moisturizer.
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,USA,not terrible but not amazing,I’ve repurchased this and I’m still on the fence as to how I feel about it. I like the ingredients and I do like the way my skin looks after I apply it. It does feel pretty occlusive on the skin which I was very surprised about because it feels very light in texture. I have notice that it does sting my skin a bit when I apply it and it does smell like alcohol which is why I’m knocking off a star.
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,USA,The Inkey List Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,"Warning* this is typical moisturizer, not a fan of the smell. Gives me drug store vibes."
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,New Zealand,Okay,Got this hoping it would give a similar look to Tarte brightening moisturizer however it doesn't have the same glowy results. slightly tacky on application and skin is well nourished in the morning after PM application.
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,USA,"Great moisturizer, great price",Great moisturizer so far and I love the price! Keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day and absorbs well.
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,USA,Just another impractical product.,This product didn’t brighten or even out my uneven skin tone. It didn’t boost my moisture levels either. I used this for two weeks and didn’t see any visible improvement to the texture/tone of my skin.
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,New Zealand,questionable ,"it made my skin feel tacky but not in a good way. I don't think it was very hydrating but I think this is because it is not for my skin type. 
I have normal-dry and I am 20. It didn't feel like it was soaked into my skin "
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Australia,Must try,Amazing product. A must try!
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,USA,enjoying,Bought on a whim and have only been using a few days but it definitely brightens! Good moisture too
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Australia,Didn’t notice a difference… ,"I didn’t notice a difference with this moisturiser. It’s a good moisturiser though, it made my skin feel hydrated but I didn’t notice a difference in brightening. It’s a good price for what it is.. "
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Australia,Symbright Brightening Moisturiser ,This Moisturiser has been amazing! My skin has brightened up a lot since using it and my blemishes have faded. Its very lightweight and sinks into the skin immediately.
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,New Zealand,brightening  ,I gave this moisturiser to my friend and she loves it. She’s got quite sensitive skin but hasn’t broken out ever since she’s used it. It’s lightweight and hydrating. 
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Australia,Much better results than I expected,"I use The Ordinary products quite often and was recommended by a friend to try out this brand instead. She said she found their products to work much better, so I gave it a shot. I have to say the results of this moisturiser are so much better than I expected. It doesn’t actually lighten my skin tone obviously, but it does, very effectively, lighten and get rid of dark marks and spots! Worked perfectly in that regard actually. I’m very pleased with the outcome of this purchase and will definitely try other products from this brand as well."
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Australia,good moisturiser ,"It helps to brighten the skin. you can get good results. I used it for a month now. I can see a little change in my face. It brightens some dark spots of my face. So it’s good. 
"
THE INKEY LIST-Symbright Brightening Moisturiser,Australia,Symbright Brightening Moisturiser ,This moisturiser is some next level hydration. My skin also felt smoother and brighter yet it didn’t feel heavy and was lovely under my makeup. If you need a good moisturiser I would definitely recommend this product. 
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,Malaysia,not bad but not good ,I was expecting more from this price point. It doesn’t cause any breakouts or what but I also don’t see or feel anything that has the wow effect. I wouldn’t buy this product again as I don’t see the value in it. 
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,Canada,love it,Perfectly hydrates my skin. Can be used as a night or day time cream. Will definitely purchase again!
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,Canada,LOVE,"I wanted to try this for so long, but hadn’t because of the price. I finally bought it and wish I got it sooner. My oily skin LOVES this. By the end of the day my skin is still matte. So far no complaints, if you have oily skin I would say it is worth trying"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Just a GREAT moisturizer!!,"I’m actually really surprised at how much I love this! I’ve never used a moisturizer that wowed me, but this one did. I love the consistency, the smell is pleasant, and it doesn’t make me break out which is huge. It even works well under make up. Despite the steep price (which is more than I’ve ever paid for a moisturizer), I would buy this again for sure!"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,Singapore,Glamglow,Very suitable for those with oily skin. It is not sticky. Very cooling and smooth to apply. Feels refreshing.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,Singapore,so so?,I didn't find this beneficial for my skin? I love their masks but this didn't do much for my oily and acne skin? Nice texture and feel to skin but that's all at least for me
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Game Changer,"I just bought a second jar after a month and half of twice a day use. You could probably get two months of use out of single jar, but I like to slather this on. The texture is a light gel and it feels cool on your skin. The product has a slight minty black licorice scent that fades after a couple seconds. I have acne prone combo skin and get hormonal acne around my mouth, not only did this product help clear up my problem spots, it also prevented new ones. I did not experience any purging or break outs from this. My skin looks plump and clear and I will ugly cry if this ever gets discontinued."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,Canada,feels luxurious,"This feels luxurious. I hate the moisturizers that leave your face feeling like there’s goop on it. This feels glorious. And has hydrated my poor winter face amazingly. I’m in love. I haven’t found another face moisturizer that I really like so I’ll splurge. Using once at night this product has lasted me three months so far. There is still more in the jar, it may last me 4."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Feels so good on my face! Even in the winter my face doesn’t seem to feel dry at all with this, and my makeup sits really nicely on top of it. Only downside is the price but I got a free sample, and will definitely be buying this once I’m out."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,Singapore,Purge but great ,"This product caused purging (which is good). Mine lasted for about 3 weeks and at the start of the 4th week, I can see that my skin is getting clearer than before I started this product. Don't give up too early and you'll see results"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,Singapore,Didn’t work for me,Item didn’t really work for me. Caused me acne maybe my skin is sensetive and not able to use just any Moisturizer but hey maybe it dosen’t work for me but ok for you :)
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,This product is literally SO AMAZING. This is my first time writing a review for any product and I've been through a ton of skin care stuff. This moisturizer is my holy grail and if anyone has acne prone skin then this is for you. It literally makes my skin glow and I'm never going back to anything else.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,A must have for acne-prone skin!,"Lightweight, good for acne, easy to pile on a sunscreen or other moisturizer on top. I love it!"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Cool moisturizer,"Love this stuff so much , got a sample from Sephora beauty offers a couple months ago and I would have purchased if there weren’t so many others products on Sephora I wanted to try lol. Makes my skin very moisturized and soft , helps with acne & old scars as has a slight cool feel to it. The product absorbs nicely and leaves a nice Matt glow on my skin."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,"Absolutely love and obsessed with this for my combo skin!! It feels so nice on my face, I continue to feel it throughout the day and I don’t start to feel oily or anything like I typically would!"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,My Holy Grail!!,"I normally don’t write reviews, but I had to for this product. This is my HOLY GRAIL!! I have been searching for the perfect moisturizer for combo (mostly oily) acne prone skin & I FINALLY have found it. Not only is my skin crazy moisturized, but my acne is under control & my pores are almost nonexistent. I have no oily shine & this has helped with my redness so much. My skin has never looked & felt so healthy. I pray they never stop making this moisturizer. WELL WORTH THE PRICE!!"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,big fan!,My all time fave moisturizer for combination/oily skin. I've bought a lot of high end moisturizers in my day and I loved being able to see immediate results from this one. It melts right into my skin and keeps my skin from getting too oily in my tzone. Just ordered my second jar today!
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Better than Drunk Elephant!,"Best daytime moisturizer I've found yet for my sensitive and extremely acne-prone skin! No greasy residue, light enough to wear under makeup and a great texture. A better price point than the Drunk Elephant I switched from, with better acne fighting ingredients! I love it!"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Are ten stars possible?,"This is the first product I’ve found that works to treat the  clogged pores around my mouth and chin and that literally nothing else would touch. I woke this morning to see them visibly reduced in just one night and practically lunged for my phone to but the full size. My 51 year-old skin is oily, sensitive and congested and I’ve recently learned that if menopause isn’t enough of a treat in itself, it also causes adult acne (this is in addition to the Wolverine-worthy beard and sideburns that grow in) 
Can’t recommend this product enough. No irritation to my sensitive skin and I personally love the smell. If you deal with clogged pores/congestion at all, whatever your age, this will help."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Great product but expensive,"This is a review for the Glamglow moisturizer I got from sephora. 
Definitely a high price at $56 for 1.7 oz/ 50 mL but a little goes a long way and it does last long. I like that it has acne fighting ingredient. Has a light scent of black licorice. I hate black licorice but this scent I could handle. Is a very lightweight lavender color moisturizer. It is for Normal, Combination, and Oily skin. It has Hyaluronic Acid,  Salicylic Acid, Glycolic Acid, Pyruvic Acid. I would buy again."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,I think this is a great! Although I am not a fan on fragrances in skin care it is a light and tolerable smell. If I could change one thing it would be that. Does feel moisturizing and nice on the skin. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,New staple!,My skin is very congested and I've been using exfoliating moisturizers on my body for ages but have always found ones for your face either very tacky or not moisturizing enough. For a long time I've been making my own (mixing BHA and AHA gels into a light moisturizer) but decided to give this a try. I'm sold - it felt light going on and I woke up the next morning to perfectly moisturized and balanced skin. I use with a toner (I never go without toner) and didn't find that the combo was too harsh.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Too pricey but Great Product,This moisturizer absorbs super well into the skin - it doesn't leave me feeling sticky or heavy or anything - it's truly like water. I think it works great under foundation as well. My only quells are that it smells like hard candy my grandma sits out and that the price isn't worth it. There are plenty of nice moisturizers that you can get that are far cheaper than this.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,"Literally as the name says it GLOW, my skin glows and look amazing"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Great Moisturizer,"This moisturizer smells great, is a pretty color and feels good on the skin."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,"This is a lovely moisturizer! It has a really nice smell and pretty color. Overall, it worked really well, was very moisturizing and sinks into the skin really quickly."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Good lightweight PM moisturizer,"Great PM moisturizer for normal to combo skin. I love the gentle blend of actives. The cream itself absorbs quickly and my skin felt plump the next day. I don't love the licorice smell but it doesn't stick around for long. Unfortunately, since it's water based, a lot of foundations and primers pill over it so it's better for night time application."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,better than Tatcha!,"Im a little picky when it comes to moisturizers because some will say hydrating and feel tacky and dry. I was hesitant to try this out bc ive been allergic to salicylic acid in the past. This moisturizer did not give me any bad reaction. It was actually very moisturizing and no weird dry feeling after apply. Received this complimentary for review purposes, my opinions are completely my own."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,I received GLAMGLOW SUPERWATERGEL for free from Influenster and I am extremely satisfied with the improvements with my skin. I have noticed it is softer without being too oily and it absorbs super fast! I am excited to continue to keep using it and to add more GLAMGLOW products to my routine.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,"Amazingly hydrating moisturizer! It was very water based which I love! It didnt feel greasy after wearing it in the day or in the night, it didnt make me break out like most moisturizers do for me. My skin is extremely oily and this gives me a subtle glow but not to much glow that I look super oily"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Good active ingredient moisturizer,"It was fine! I received a full size sample of this as part of a campaign. I like the consistency and it sinks into my skin well enough. It’s great if acne is your foremost concern, but for me I prefer to limit active ingredients to my serums and I limit my AHAs to specific days so this isn’t something that I would personally use on a regular basis. Docking a star because of that personal preference but it’s great otherwise!"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,My new favorite moisturize cream. I have acne on my face this moisturizer don’t make my acne worse like the other ones I was using this is perfect for me.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Bang for your buck.,This product size is very generous. It’s not like some of them where you think you’re getting a decent amount only to find it’s just a really big jar with a dab at the bottom. You get a bang for your buck and the product itself is great. It doesn’t flake off or leave you greasy like other products. It has a very VERY light scent of black licorice. If you don’t like that it honestly is barely even noticeable and it disappears really quickly.  Another good thing is a little bit goes a long way. I use it very night and will def be buying more. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. With that being said I had my husband try some and he said “babe.. that’s a winner” lol
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I absolutely love the Glamglow Superwatergel moisturizer. I just moved to New York recently and my skin is still getting acclimated to the weather. This is the perfect moisturizer to protect me from the harsh weather and from wearing a mask all day. It’s lightweight and oil free so it helps my skin breathe without clogging my pores.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,"I have combination skin. It worked really well! I was breaking out a lot more than I usually do, but after using this product my skin got better. I do have less acne than when I first started using GLAMGLOW. Although I didn't like the scent, it wasn't super strong. When applying, the moisturizer did absorb easily and my skin felt hydrated. But I did notice that my skin would dry out and I would need to reapply to keep my skin hydrated."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Decent,The product stays on all day. Smells good and keeps face moisturized. Down side is the product can very easily be applied was too thick or not enough.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,This is the best moisturizer I’ve ever used - it’s so lightweight and keeps me hydrated without feeling greasy. The gel texture is great and you can really feel it sink in. You also get enough to last a long time and it’s made my sensitive skin so glowy!
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,It's ok. Not great,"The moisturizer felt the water-based formula immediately when you put it on. It is lightweight, cooling, and fas-absorbent. My issues were with the fragrance, which was not super unpleasant, but it did not feel like it lined up with the product. I also did not enjoy the somewhat sticky-ish feeling it left after, which went away after an hour or so. I did not feel like it hydrated for the whole day. I actually had to apply it multiple times a day to counteract my dry winter skin."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Would definitely recommend,It was very light weight and absorbed right away. It didn't leave an oily residue and lasted all day. The color and fragrance were very nice as well.

GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Perfect for winter,I love this product! My skin is so sensitive sometimes and breaks out with almost every moisturizer I tried. I have been using this for a whole month and have not had this issue! It has irritated my 4 mo sons skins either as he is always rubbing his face on mine. It smells kind of minty which doesn’t bother me. Applied very smooth and evenly. Didn’t take very long to dry down and kept my skin soft! I’m so glad I tried this and will continue use! I also love that it has all of the stuff my skin needs in this one product so I’m not spending a ton of money on various products. I highly recommend this.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,EXCELLENT,Not oily resulta and hidrates skin pretty well! Good price for the results. Leaves a fresh feeling after use
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Not for me.,this products was just okay. I have more dry skin so it did not work that incredible for me but I could see this being super awesome for more oily prone skin types. Also I was not to fond of the smell. It has a LOT of fragrance in it which can be sensitizing for many people.  Other then that super cute packaging and I did not break out so that’s great.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Love!,"This product is truly wonderful. It’s not too thick which I love for my combination skin. Honestly, it’s so good my boyfriend has stolen it & claimed it for himself. I received this in a Vox Box but would definitely buy it!"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Refreshing,Love this moisturizer! Keeps my skin nice and smooth while providing a cooling sensation!
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,SUPERWATERGEL & 3 ACIDS.,"Well I'll start by telling you that I had never tried this brand's creams until I got this free product from the influenster.  I am currently using this moisturizer, as the name implies, it is a water gel,
      does not contain oils,
      and it is a good option for oily, combination and normal skin.
      Its texture is light, it hydrates enough, without feeling of heaviness.
      it has good hydration and is perfect for skin feeling fresh.
      Its smell is soft, the sensation when applied to the face is fresh, it feels very good.
      I love that it has hyaluronic acid to keep my skin hydrated, and the salicylic and glycolic acids keep my skin bright and clear, it also helps clear up certain acne spots on my face.
      And as for its presentation, I love it!  the stars, silver, typeface and size are perfect.
      I would recommend them for girls who prefer gel creams and want to see their face bright and fresh.  But I do not recommend them for dry or sensitive skin, it does not hydrate enough for this type of skin and two, it contains acids that could irritate the skin."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,This is the nicest feeling moisturizer I have ever used. My incredibly acne prone and sensitive skin has thrived with this product. A little goes a long way and it doesn’t leave a sticky or heavy film.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Im loving this moisturizer,I absolutely adore this product! It makes my skin feel so smooth & refreshed after putting it on. The gel also made my skin feel soft and moisturized. Just a small amount goes along way. This worked surprisingly well on my skin. There was a noticeable difference from when I 1st began using it. I’d recommend for anyone with oily/ acne prone skin looking for a daily moisturizer.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Smooth Skin,I absolutely love this product! It makes my skin feel so smooth & refreshed after applying it. I totally recommend this to anyone looking for a moisturizer. Just a little dab goes a long way.

GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Review,This product made my skin feel so soft and moisturized. I’m not sure it I would spend that amount of money on this product. But i received this product as a complimentary product.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Good but too pricey,"While I enjoy this product and it feels high quality, I wouldn’t buy it with my own money. I find it too pricey. I also kind of dislike it’s scent. I have sensitive skin and it hasn’t broken me out so that’s good though!"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Great product,It feels like a normal water gel moisturizer. Just a little bit goes a long way and you definitely see a difference! It has a light minty smell that fades away. Typically I like a thicker moisturizer but this one has worked amazing for my dry skin. I've been using it for over a month now and I've noticed the little pimples I would get on my chin aren't popping up as frequently as they used to.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,"Nice gel! It’s very light and makeup goes on top of it alright. I wouldn’t say 10/10 Because it smells like licorice! Over all I’d probably get it again but not my first choice especially at the price point. 

(I got this for review through Influenster)"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,I like this product a lot. My skin is very dry and sensitive at times and so far this doesn’t irritate me at all. The cream doesn’t feel to greasy or heavy and my skin feels fresh and smooth every time I use it. I would recommend trying this as one of your daily skincare routines!
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Fresh and glowing,"I love that it is simple, scent free and definitely glowing. just a small dab of the product covers my face nicely. The only thing I would say to improve is allowing it to last longer. The moisturizer dried up quicker than I expected but maybe because it was really absorbed in my skin. This is my first time trying this brand but I probably just have to buy more! I received it for free to test but I would really recommend it."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,This worked amazing on my skin. There was a noticeable difference from one day to the next. It does hydrate really well too. One thing though is that it has a weird smell to it but other than that it works great! Honestly I’d actually purchase again (:
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Great for oily skin,This moisturizer is really awesome.  I have oily skin so I have trouble finding moisturizers that I like. I use it at night before I go to bed and it feels very wet when you first put it on (but in a really nice cooling way) but it dries pretty quickly. I’d recommend for anyone with oily/ acne prone skin looking for a daily moisturizer.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Strong and smooth,This product is great - my skin gets dryer with the cold weather and this smooth gel moisturizer really helps. I tend to have skin that is not acne prone and can be sensitive to acids so I’ll only be incorporating this about once a week! I received for free to try
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,"This stuff is great! I’m super dry, so I need to use a heavier moisturizer at night, but this is the perfect thing to use during the day under makeup. It’s never greasy, but I still feel hydrated!"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Love this,"I love this moisturizer! I think it’s for my combination skin, and i do feel like the acids do there job as well as locking in the moisture! I’ve been using this every night and my skin feels clearer and very healthy so far this winter i also feel like my skin is more plump since using this moisturizer!"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Good on acne prone skin!,"I received this product free to review and rate. I liked the moisturizer! It definitely made my skin feel softer and more moisturizes after use. There is kind of a strange smell the first time you open it and use it, but i didn’t notice it with continued use. I would definitely recommend. I have acne prone skin and this did not make me break out at all!"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Still testing out,"Hello! 
This is my first GlamGlow product; I recieved it complementary from Influenster in exchange for my honest and thorough review. 
Immediately you notice the purple hue of the product and the scent. The scent is so unlike any other skincare product I've used, I can't pinpoint the scent but the closest would be.... licorice? Not unpleasant but strange. The smell dissipates on the skin rather quickly. The texture is very light, immediately melting onto the skin. It's very cooling and moisturizing. I'm not sure of the lasting effects of moisturizing, it seems more like a temporary fix. I will say at this time of year my skin is extremely dry, so maybe that is too much of a challenge, haha. I will be continuing to use this product and will decided if I will repurchase once it's used up. I don't know the exact cost but the ""brand"" is expensive for what it is in my opinion."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,Glamglow is a very well established product to use  made my face feel very hydrated and not  oily it made my face glow and look amazing I would recommend this product to my friends and family thank you sephora
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,"I give this a 10/10. After a nice face wash, this is perfect moisturizer to match either with a nice face beat, or a before bed routine. So light on the skin, I love it."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,I received this product from influenster and I so excited to try! The texture it’s amazing! Thank you influenster!!
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Great at night,I’ve enjoyed this product at night! It’s great to hydrate after a warm shower that dries out my face. The moisturizer instantly cools your face.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Lightweight Champion!,This amazing purple moisturizer is amazing! I have sensitive skin but haven’t noticed any breakouts since using this which is amazing considering also being in a mask all day. It’s a lightweight texture so doesn’t leave my skin greasy and that’s a plus since I have oily skin!
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Hydrating,I have been using this for 2 weeks and I have been enjoying it. It's very hydrating and it has that cooling effect. It also smells like mint. I have very dry skin for reference.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,"Hydrates, pore clarity and shine free YES!",I have used several of glam glow‘s products before and always fall in love and this is no exception. A lot of products claim gel texture but leave the sticky tacky feeling and this does not do that. It goes on and disappears but you can see the results of the clarity it gives from the acids in the product. It definitely changed my face from dry and ashy feeling after washing it to feeling hydrated as best as a gel can. My pores though whew FLUSHED!! Be careful about using after a good face scrubbing it will tingle a smidge if you were rough before applying but nothing intolerable for me. It has the classic licorice smell to it so expect that but that’s the ONLY time I like that smell haha
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Works great,So far I am in love with this product. I have been struggling with dryness but this superwatergel helps me a lot.
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Nice triple-acid clarifying moisturizer,"GlamGlow SuperWaterGel is a nice, clarifying, lightweight gel moisturizer. I have dry skin that needs help with exfoliation, and I like how this moisturizer contains acids that can help with that. The moisturizer has the classic GlamGlow scent, sort of a minty, eucalyptus and licorice fragrance. It’s a refreshing smell, and thankfully the fragrance is much lighter in this moisturizer than it is in the face masks (I like it in the masks, but it would be too strong to wear all day lol). I do prefer my moisturizer and face products to be fragrance-free, but it’s not a deal breaker for me. The moisturizer is also in nice packaging. I like the sort of minimalist silver and white. 

As for function, I’m a fan! This will be a good addition to my face routine. I’m not super prone to breakouts, but I do deal with some around my chin and this is helpful for reducing those breakouts without causing too much dryness! It absorbs pretty quickly, which is really nice, and is a great, lightweight daytime moisturizer. So far, it hasn’t caused any issues with my sensitive, dry skin. I mostly use it in the areas where I breakout or need help with exfoliation, and the rest (my driest and least prone to breakouts) gets a straight hyaluronic moisturizer with no fragrance. 

Overall, a pretty nice clarifying moisturizer! Seems like it will be a good option for people with acne who don’t want to dry out their skin. I wish it had no fragrance, but it’s"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,"I enjoy the texture of the product, it feels hydrating yet not too heavy. It has a minty smell. I took off one star because it can feel thick in certain climates, however this is a good product for oily skin in the winter."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,"It’s purple. Feels silkly to the touch. Goes on smooth, absorbed into my skin and didn’t leave me feeling dry. Not heavy very lightweight. Has a slight smell but I can’t fully place it"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,10/10 recommend,"I love this stuff! My face loves this stuff! Such a great moisturizer, not greasy and absorbs into the skin great leaving it feeling so refreshed and new! No regrets! Absolutely recommend 10/10!"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Love love love,This product is truly amazing! Let me start off by saying I have very oily skin and have had it for like ever. Like I live for rice paper and oil soaking paper. But this product really has blown me away. . I saw a huge difference after using it and I still do with every day I use it. Now that I no longer use face makeup since I’m wearing my mask all day at work I feel so much more confident about my skin. Now yes I still have an oily face and that’s ok. I know it will be good for my face in the long run but if you are looking for a product to help you CONTROL the oil and still HYDRATE your skin and also some bonuses to help your acne prone skin then this is the product for you!
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,ABSOLUTELY THE BEST,"I received this product to try before it was released in stores and I have to say I’m so in love it smells so good and it has improved my skin so much I leaves me glowing and my skin has never been softer.

Most make me break out but using this both in the morning and at night after washing my face has made my face less dry. It's the perfect product for us with oily skin. I also really like that the scent isn't overpowering or smell like chemicals. Kind of smells like mint to me.

I will definitely buy this product!"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,My new favorite!!,"I love this moisturizer. I have sensitive skin, but I’ve had no new breakouts or redness since using this product and the AHA and BHA really help my skin stay clear and glowy. The moisturizer is thick but feels so light on the skin, and it makes a great base for makeup since it doesn’t slip or slide around, even if I’m sweating! I haven’t had any winter dry patches because this stuff is sooo moisturizing. The scent is light and minty, almost like a spa but verrry faint and nice. I use it both day and night and it’s become my favorite moisturizer!!"
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,I love this,I am always looking for the perfect moisturizer and I finally found it! This is amazing and absorbs so nicely. I love the lavender color and a little goes a long way.

I liked how it wasn’t oily or greasy just made my skin feel very hydrated. I didn’t love the smell though. It was somewhat unpleasant to me. It’s too soon to tell what effects it has on my skin, but so far I enjoy the product."
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Wonderful moisture,So far I am loving this product and I would defiantly purchase more! I work in healthcare and wear a mask for long hours. I have been struggling with dryness and breakouts but this superwatergel defiantly helps with the dryness and flaking I get!
GLAMGLOW-Superwatergel Triple-Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Great moisturizer,Great gel moisturizer. It left my face feeling nice and hydrated throughout the day. A little of the product goes a long way. My only complaint would be the smell (black licorice and mint). But I would definitely purchase this in the near future.
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,Ms,"It's make your skin smooth, radiant even without makeup or as base.  The brand Dior is my all times favourite.  Love it!"

DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Australia,Dior DreamSkin,"Great primer for any foundation. Also, the perfect match with Dior Back Stage Foundation."
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,Ms,I used the old version few years ago and stopped using it since Dior discontinued the old version. Got a sample for this new version from Dior recently and I like it so decided to purchase a big bottle during Sephora sale. 
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,expensive but works,This is one of those hybrid products that works as a skincare as well as a base for makeup. I find that it works well as both a primer and a face serum. A bit pricey but worth it especially for more mature skin like mine. 
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,Breakouts,I had to throw away even though a lot of it was unused as it made my face breakout.
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,Nice bottle but useless,"A nice add on to my skincare collection but honestly, I think it's just an extra useless step in the morning routine. It smells good and doesn't make me breakout, so I don't mind finishing the bottle."
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,Love it so much,"Totally worth the price. My skin definitely looks a lot smoother after wearing this. Also, notice that my acne scars fade slowly. It’s definitely pricey but 1 pump is more than enough for me. Also, enjoying using this under my makeup as well. Will definitely re-purchase this. Just wish that sephora can sell the refill instead of the whole bottle. "
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,nice product ,"With all the mask wearing, this moisturiser is one of my favourites. I can smell the lovely scent which is not too strong as what some reviewers have commented. However I find the packaging not very good because a part of it fell when I was using it. "
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Australia,Great Birthday present,The product was a great price. the whole online experience from start to finish was great. I was worried that the product was not going to make due to being in a state that was in a Covid-19 lock down
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,Ms,I bought this for myself and essence of light for my mom. I’m not sure why this product makes my skin to breakouts and looks dull. And essence of light helped me to clear it. I would repurchase the essence of light not this. 
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,Dior Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,"Dior Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion. Good product. I apply it every morning. My face immediately look radiant and soft. I felt moisture to my oily skin, I doesn’t make my face more oily. "
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,Amazing product,"It was love at first sight, smell, texture!  An amazing product - thank you Dior! One pump is sufficient for full face and neck.  It gives a lovely muted glow to the skin.  Evens out skin tone and discolouration beautifully.  Double duty as primer with skincare ingredients.  For those ""no makeup"" days, I use this over my face with a light dusting of powder and I'm good to go."
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,im in love!! ,Its really a great product! Even though the price is quite expensive but its really worth every penny... my skin looks really good when i use this for my makeup base.. my makeup also dont crack and last longger until 9 hours.. i will continue using this. Tq Dior!!
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,Primer with skin care ingredients I ,"I have dry skin with uneven skin tone. Make up can't last for long hence want to find a primer. Tried this texture at counter, attracted by it fragrance but didn't buy it that time as I'm not sure will it suit to my skin. After wore it for hours, I know it suits to me! Bought it when members' sale. Now I just use it single without foundation with good and natural look. Although it coverages not very strong,but it is ok for me."
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,second bottle,"I love this item. This is my second bottle. Combined this with dior one essential detox serum, works well for my skin condition. Recommended for troubled skin."
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,disappointed with dior skincare again,"The texture is a bit greasy, the fragrance not really pleasant for me. It cause my face break out eventually. Quite regret to purchase this product. I have been trying dior line skincare, almost most of them quite disappointing, their ingredients seemed like not nature and not suitable to sensitive skin. "
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,Favorite ever,"I swear by this emulsion. I got it as a tester in the States and every time I used it as a primer/moisturizer, people would say my skin was glowing so I bought the full sized version and really love it. I just use a toner and then this emulsion and put my make foundation on and its great. Sometimes I use it without foundation and I do notice that my skin feels and looks glowier in any case. 

It’s really pricey but as I only use a pea sized amount each time, this could last quite a while. "
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,best,"This is my to go moisturiser on the days that I don’t wear my foundation. If you have a good skincare routine, this moisturiser will do a good job of minimise pores and providing even skin colour. Can be used as a primer as well for dry skin. Highly recommended. "
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,Ms,"Suppose to purchase Cell Energy, tried using this but caused allergy to my face, stopped using it immediately. Any chance of changing it after just single use? If not posdible for a change Its alright"
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,Perfect,"i have use this product for more than 5 years. it gave a perfect look after my routine face creams. it acts as a moisturiser, primer, makes skin looks perfectly smooth and glow. highly recommended"
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,A good primer and moisturizer ,perfect for dry skin.. my skin became hydrated and supple after applying this. very soothing fragrance and good texture. Good to go if you are looking for a primer and well as a good moisturizer 
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,good coverage ,"Skin become smooth and pores are gone. Beautiful product and the liquid texture is nice. Not too strong and not clogging the pores. Too pricey and will buy again during Sephora sales and will be better in bigger bottle. Overall, good to create flawless skin"
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,best of the best!,I love how this product is able to give me a very natural look on days I feel like skipping my foundation. Furthermore it has anti aging properties too! Killing 2 birds with one stone! 
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,,Great moisturizer and primer,This is a lux moisturizer and primer but does worth every cent. It literally melts into the skin giving it a healthy pearlised glow and minimise pores. Makeup goes on effortlessly and last longer after application. Great for if you can get it during Sephora sale. 
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Worth the hype.,"My boyfriend splurged last year on La Mer for me when he heard I wanted to try it. My skin looks better than it has in years. I like the soft cream for daytime. I was afraid it wasn’t worth the hype, at 45 I’ve tried everything. I can honestly say it’s worth it if you have the money."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Canada,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer - 15ml,Excellent cream! Expensive but worth every cent! It hydrates. It evens out skin tone!  It helps with small blemishes as well. A small amount is all you need daily. Try it you won't regret it. As a male I have tried every expensive facial cream whether for men and/or women. La Mer is in the top 3 for excellent quality!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,Favourite version ,"Tried all versions of the famous La Mer moisturizer and this is my favourite. Hydrating enough yet works for the humidity where I live. Doesn’t break me out either, I have sensitive skin. "
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,best mosturiser,Very premium moisturiser but worth every penny…Love the scent and the texture. Melts into you skin and brighten up my skin and dewy skin the next day 
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,MUST HAVE FOR THE DRY GIRLS,"I have extremely dry skin. I love the soft cream moisturizer. It’s whipped and light weight. My skin looks so hydrated after using this. I’ve used a lot of moisturizer, high end and low end. This is my absolute favorite. 

I see that some people are comparing this to the regular moisturizer. I have used the other one prior to this one. I have also enjoyed the regular moisturizing cream, which is super heavy. The soft cream is just a lighter version. The regular one will be good for the colder months when the wind is harsh."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,90s BABY WIPES,"This product straight up smells like baby wipes from the 90s. How this company got people to pay hundreds of dollars for this greasy, smelly, basic moisturizer is the real miracle broth, not the goo in the jar."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer - 30ml,"love this so much! i’ve been struggling with acne since i was a teen and this has helped SO MUCH throughout the years. i usually am sensitive to fragrances but this is the only lotion that smells good while also helping my skin. i used to damage my skin barrier by using all these actives on my skin, but since i used this my skin has never felt softer. here are some descriptions of what i struggled with before using this; dry patches, small red bumps that would make my skin have rough texture, frequent zits around my chin area, i would pick and scratch at my pimples causing a lot of scarring"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,Good and Pricey,"Good finish several bottle but I decided to stop as it’s too pricey, overall is good but I’ve realized that sometime it is too moisturized that it create acne around my face, recommend to use alternative day "
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,make my skin soft and radiant ,"Been a lamer user for a decade and give it thumbs up for their products..
I have very dry skin and will feel itchy if use other Products dun have this issue with lamer.. It actually made my skin soft and radiant after use. "
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Canada,Not for Acne-prone Skin,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) DO NOT recommend if you have combo-oily skin. Used it one night and woke up to a whole bunch of new breakouts
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,holy grail! ,"Recommended for dry skin, very moist, perfect for sensitive skin, help to calm redness, but super expensive :( my holy grail product! Best moisturizer ive ever tried!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,It works!,"I just starting using this product about 30 days ago. This cream is NOT an overpriced Nivea!!! I noticed a difference in my skin the next morning from applying at night. My face was brighter and even toned, I couldn't believe it! I've been hooked since. It does smell like Nivea and same constently but it's the broth inside the skin that u don't smell or feel that makes the difference.  Don't get it twisted! I'll be a regular user of this product."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,I’m shooketh ,"My most bougie skincare product to date. Read reviews from both sides of the camp (how it compares with N). They say it’s just moisturiser but omg this feels like LOVE. Like having your closest, most trusted partner cupping your face and assuring that things will get better. I look forward to using this every night. Was a little worried about it being too heavy but READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. I emulsified the product in my fingers before patting onto my face. "
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,basically overpriced Nivea,"I really wanted to find this special and somewhat worth the price. But it’s really just overpriced Nivea. Like, it actually feels and smells just like it. And don’t get me wrong, I actually love Nivea during winter months here and there, but it does not need to cost this much. This is for people who have money to throw around but for the average person, save your money, this isn’t all that special at all. I waited days to wake up and see a difference in my skin but it really didn’t do anything than basic moisturizing."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer - 30ml,"I hate that I love this stuff, only because of the price tag. But it has done wonders for my skin. It has not only reduced fine lines & provided remarkable hydration, but also lightened the sun damage that I have been struggling with for some time. Very luxurious product."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,The only moisturizer that works!,"I have sensitive skin, but I am not sure what ingredients in moisturizers that irritate my skin. I have combo skin, but leaning towards dry sometimes. most dry skin moisturizers feel too greasy and didnot absorb properly. Most oily skin moisturizers dont hydrate enough. Some will makes my face darker and red after application (Clinique moisture surge). As soon as i tried this (with a travel size at first), my skin was calm, just enough hydration. it absorbs quickly, a little goes a long the way. I used suggested application method by La Mer. I worked offshore sometimes and will always get sun burn. After 1 of the trip, which I started using religiously the concentrate and this moisturizer for a week, the burn marks heal quicker and people complimented that my skin looks cleaner and better.  1/2 star off because for that price I wish it has more active ingredients and has anti-aging benefit. Major like for the calming, healing and just enough hydration."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Fancy Nivea,"I can't get over how closely in texture and smell this is to Nivea Hand Cream. Its practically identical. LaMer made a big mistake when they allowed samples of this cream to be made available, for us peasants to try... The prestigious reputations, and cult like mystique of this product has been stripped away to reveal an over priced, stuffy, dated formula, that smells and feels like my grandpa hand lotion."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Wow,"I got this as a sample and just had to wash it off immediately after applying. Too thick, sticky, and smells funny. I came here to review it and I am so shocked at the price, especially for such a terrible product.

Who would buy this?!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Acne prone stay clear,Oily skin / acne prone stay far away from this product. Upon first use my skin looked great but then again I was only using a small portion at night. After  a few days I started to see a few new acne spots then it went crazy after doing some more research about the product. I  discovered it contains an ingredient that’s like putting pure oil on face which causes break outs so bottom like if you have acne prone skin run from this product.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,The Moisturizing Soft Cream,The transformational benefits of the iconic Crème de la Mer in a rich yet weightless cream formula. Leaves skin with a luminous appearance. Weigtless is the operative word here!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Not worth the price,"I received this as a trial size. The positives are it is a decent moisturizer and it doesn’t make me break out like the original La Mer did. That said, nothing can justify the price of this product. I could replenish my entire regular skincare products for the cost of the mini size of this stuff. Botox is cheaper for me than this cream. If you have the kind of expendable income to spend on this, more power to you. I don’t think it’s worth it."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Buyer beware!!!,"I'm going to be honest: this is not what it's cracked up to be (Kanye shrug). I received a sample size of this with my purchase and I didn't like the results of just the sample size so I returned this cream before even opening it. The products mad my skin look flaky and dry, yes dry. I know different results for different folks but definitely try to obtain a sample before you spend your money on this. Not worth it at all."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Canada,"YES EXPENSIVE, BUT WORTH EVERY PENNY!","The La Mer line is the best of the very best!  It's expensive, but it works.  Rather than go get botox and other cosmetic procedures, use this instead!  In the end, it will be cheaper!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,junk,"Don't do it ladies, I don't care if you think you're the Queen of Sheba (you're not btw)
honestly you're better off just doing a coffee and grain detox 
my friend who gifted this and the eye cream for me said he didn't notice any changes in my skin, none what's so ever, (it will make your skin soft but that's all moisturizers do anyway)
La Mer is overhyped and gimmicky, the company doesn't promise anything extraordinary & people are still dumb enough to buy it."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,No. just no.,"There’s literally nothing special in this that warrants it being so ridiculously expensive. Don’t buy into the hype, you can buy an entire high end skincare routine for the price of this single product."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,My Obsession,Expensive but oh so good! I've tried using other moisturizers because of the cost but I always come back to this! I work hard and it's my splurge! I'm obsessed with how it makes my skin glow!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,NOT worth even 1/2 the price,"Oh, but I tried to love this. At the price, you are almost ashamed to admit it’s doesn’t work.I am very fair, have redness, scar tissue, dark under eye circles, very fine pores, dryness & fine wrinkles at 53. I noticed no improvement in my skin that any moisturizing lotion wouldn’t give me. I used this for weeks, and went back to try it again multiple times due to the cost. There are several leas expensive yet still luxury brands I love much, much better. I ended up using this as the most expensive hand and elbow cream in the world."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Luxury item worth having!,I’ve tried the Moisturizing Cream and very much prefer the light weight texture and consistency of the Moisturizing Soft Cream that I received complimentary from La Mer for me to try. It goes on much more easily and leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth and hydrated. A little goes a long way. Perfect for my combination skin all year round. Feels luxurious and has a nice pleasant scent.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,My Holy Grail day and night cream,"Though many said La Mer is overpriced and underdelivered, somehow it works miraculously on my ultra sensitive skin. 50ml can last more than 7 months. Worth every penny. Soft cream suits me more than moisturizing gel or cream. "
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,freaking miracle!,"This product is a staple in my household. My fiancé has rosacea and very (VERY) sensitive skin. I’m the type to try a bunch of different products, but he is incredibly cautious and selective with what he’ll use. One day his skin looked very painful and I urged him to try this (I had a sample). The difference it made was drastic and practically immediate. Now it’s the only moisturizer he will use. Yes it’s expensive, but it’s truly in a league of it’s own. That being said, only one of us can afford to use this regularly so I am glad to use less expensive moisturizers so he can use this. If your skin is struggling and you’ve tried everything else, you seriously might want to try this. I’ve also tried the classic crème de la mer but prefer this one - it has a beautiful dewy finish but still offers an incredibly amount of moisture."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Canada,not for sensitive skin!,"I am in my late 20’s and it’s my first time trying any la mer products. The texture of this cream is super refined…the cream absorbs quickly and does moisturize however, my skin turns red and warm after applying. It might be the fragrance or the essential oils in the miracle broth. Whatever it is, my skin is red no matter how much niacinamide I put on top to calm it down. I don’t know why such a luxury product doesn’t have a range formulated for sensitive skin…sad to return :("
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,Very good moisturizer- heals and hydrates ,"Bought 30ml for occasional use especially when weather is dry, suitable for sensitive and combination to dry skin. It heals the skin fast after break out, very hydrating and only need to apply small amount. Skin looks more radiant and luminous after few days, very good product. "
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Canada,great moisturizer but $$$,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) to preface, I have oily/combo skin and luckily, pretty good skin overall. I’ll say that my skin loved this cream in the fall/early winter, however as I finished the jar, I wouldn’t say that the cream was transformational by any means after 3 months of usage. I’ve heard from some people that La Mer’s miracle broth has worked wonders for their skin, but for me this was just a great, relatively lightweight, everyday moisturizer with a neutral scent that I wasn’t bothered by. removing a star because for the price point vs my experience with the cream, but overall, if you can afford it, it’s a great cream! personally I prefer the classic crème de la mer (as a night cream or for winter) but so glad that I was able to try and enjoy the cream! :)"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,Good product,"I love the texture and smell for this product. It is good, easy apply and suitable for my skin type. It is obvious that acne scars will fade in the next day. Overall it is really a good product and would like to repurchase again. "
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Not for my skin type,"The smell is wonderful and I had high hopes. But this cream, somehow, made my face more dry. It’s definitely not for me and definitely not worth the price tag."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,Best moisturizer so far,i really like this mosturizer. like the smell like the texture like the mosturising effect. also make my skin condition stable. only problem is it is really expensive 😂
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer - 15ml,"Love this moisturizer! Perfect for dry skin and I use it under makeup, not greasy and leaves the skin refreshed without the weight."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,MS,Love this product. It came in good conditions. Thanks Sephora for genuine product. 
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,La Mer,"Moisturising. Used during bedtime as a sleeping mask. But its thick, clogs pores. Found milia after a few times of using. Might try the gel version the next time round. More suitable for white skin and in colder climates where your skin dries out possibly."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer - 30ml,"I use this to put around and on my nose because it always gets dry in the winter. I wouldn’t say it’s a miracle worker, but I do like that it’s a little thicker consistency but goes on like nothings there."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer - 30ml,"A go to for every client as a professional makeup artist. it’s hydrating, and truly helps the makeup melt into skin so you don’t have a heavy looking complexion. I love love love it and it’s so worth the price for me and my clients! it’s so luxurious."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,The hype is real! It really does heal your face!,"I recently had a bad night dermaplaning my face and ended up with little cuts all over. They were kind of obvious and I was desperate to heal them ASAP. I remembered I had a sample of this in my stash and I was like, ""isn't that miracle broth stuff supposed to heal wounds?"" Well, it does. I used this two nights in a row and most of the cuts are completely gone. I was afraid to use this on my sensitive, finicky skin (I try to avoid mineral oil, silicones, fragrance — all of which is in this product) but my face is so soft and looks amazing. The hype is real."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,listen…. this is the real deal,"I used la mer when I was in my late 20’s early 30’s. I truly believe it’s what completely changed my skin and now that I’m in my 40’s I still look like I’m 30. Sure it’s expensive. I took a long break from it because it just wasn’t financially viable for me for the last few years. I just recovered from 2 years of dealing with breast cancer and thought I’d treat myself and reintroduce this cream back into my regimen. I have tried a lot of things over the past few years and some have worked great, most haven’t. I’m a beast about my skincare routine. I like looking young for my age. Retinols and so many other things haven’t done enough and I have extremely touchy sensitive skin. I was tentative about whether this would still be as magical as it was when I had more access to it financially. I ordered when there happened to be a free gift so I said I’d try the gift size and return the large if it didn’t work. My God, this really is a miracle cream. In just a few days/ about a week my skin looks and feels heavenly again. The transformation is absolutely visible almost immediately. I never feel dry anymore. I never feel oily anymore. My skin is back in tune with the universe. I really have to say I do not think this is a scam or that any other product on the market works the same. It’s absolutely worth the money to me. I’ll figure out how to keep it in my routine. I think this cream alone has replaced the idea of my getting Botox this year. It’s made all the corrections I needed… in less than 2 weeks."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,first timer,"one of most ex skin care, since got promo.. im not gonna miss this.. should try cause many reviews says its too good for skin.. moist perfectly... which is need in my early 40's"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer - 30ml,"I got a retinol burn, and it was the only cream that really helped reduce the itchiness, redness and the sensation of burning. Every  other cream for sensitive skin I used made my skin worse. I am giving 4 starts because of the price."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,worth the hype!,love love love this product. It is 100% worth the hype. it absorbs so well and in one night my pimple scars has lighten alittle. I will use this forever. this is definitely an investment kind of product. 
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Best product I've ever used.,"I love trying new skincare products and I tend to buy pricier products. This is by far the best item I've used. My skin is super soft, clear, and even toned. Love it!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Small amount light full moisturizing coverage,I got this in a sample box set and I love the texture. It's very light on the skin and doesn't lay heavy like the La Mer Creme Moisturizer. My foundation lays smooth over the top and doesn't run or fade.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,Mrs,"This cream is perfect for all skin types and all weathers. Have been using it for a while and I always stock it up when Sephora is on sale, makes it a lot more affordable. "
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,Loving it!,My 2nd purchase… The best product to prep the skin before makeup. Smells nice too. The makeup stays all day. A bit sticky feeling but it is okay. Can be use for all skin type especially for those who have sensitive skin. I used it on all of my clients. 
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,Endless repurchase ,"Holy Grail product which save me from a terrible skin allergy, however it is still abit too oily for day use hence I only use it as a night cream. Nonetheless I will keep repurchasing it until I found something that could replace this. "
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,Not for me ,I have a combination dry skin.I been try all the different textures of lamer cream.But I still didn’t get what I want.I gave it to my mom and she love it.good finishing texture scent.But still not for me..
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Canada,Hate that I love it,"I purchased the mini size fully expecting to be underwhelmed, but sadly (or not sadly) that was not the case. I have a history of using acne creams only, and have extremely sensitive skin. This is the perfect consistency - Not too heavy but extremely moisturizing. I use this morning and night for the last month, and can confirm my skin feels plump, moisturized and best of all - Clear. Guess I'll need to purchase the full size eventually!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,MOST OVERRATED PRODUCT EVER,"This product was on my bucket list. It’s always one of those celeb favorites and a product beauty “experts” swear you must try before you die. So I did . It’s nothing special. It’s not horrible. If you want a basic, fragranced and over priced product..,enjoy. I had incredibly dry skin on my nose so I thought I’d use my La Mer. It did nothing and I used it consistently for weeks. It wasn’t until I switched to something else (CT Magic Cream) did it improve. I hoped I would understand a bit about why this cream is so hyped. I just don’t. It’s average and you can get so much better for a fraction of the cost. Even for luxury products, this is overrated and not worth it!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer - 30ml,"For the cost, I just can’t get past the smell. Some other reviewer mentioned it was similar to Noxzema  and that was actually fairly accurate. I like the consistency and feel but it’s unpleasant for me due to the smell. I also used the eye cream, and the concentrate and I didn’t like the experience with any of them."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,A really good product,Tried my friend’s just once. It was really good and It felt nice on the face. Would definitely love to try this again!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,Amazing,This product incredibly amazing! It makes my skin feel soooooo smooth and soft. The cream is very rich and good for dry skin and really makes difference 
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer - 15ml,The cream is just ok. My skin felt a bit greasy after using it. Did not go well with my combo skin.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,worth the price ,My first tub of famous la mer cream! At first the smell threw me off but after a while I develop a love towards it. Soft cream is kinda gel texture which is light to use during day time. I say it does great job in moisturizing!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,not good,I have no idea why people pay so much for this. Just go get some oil of Olay and it’s pretty much the same only I think it’s better. I don’t know if I got an old batch or what but this stuff was just so chunky I couldn’t even get it to spread.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,Lai,Lamer is my most favourites !!!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Canada,Exclusive use for 3 months: what I discovered,"I wanted to justify the price, so I used this cream exclusively for 3 months. Bottom line: The price is over the top for what it does, but it's still a very nice moisturizer.

- It blends well, and doesn't feel sticky or heavy.
- It doesn't feel greasy, even when I use extra.
- I love the scent: it's fresh without being overpowering.

What I didn't like:

- It did not lessen any age-related issues even a little (wrinkles, texture, spots, redness).
- It didn't last as long as I would have liked, but my dry skin may be a factor.
- The heavy glass jar adds extra weight that I don't want in my makeup bag."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,Ms ,"I love this product but only can use at night because it is quite thick and rich not suitable for day time it’ll make my face oily and melts my makeup. Bought it during sale. But somehow I feel this product is overpriced that’s why I gave 3 stars 🥲 
"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Not Great But Not Bad Either,"I tried the Soft Cream to see if it worked the same as the heavier cream, which I love. Did it soften and make my skin feel hydrated immediately after application, yes. But, it felt like I had to use more to achieve it. As well as those benefits seemingly fading away much sooner than when I use the original moisturizer."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Canada,Comedogenic!,"Comedogenic! This contains fous pore clogging ingredients (algae seaweed, Carrageenan, algae and Laminaria Digitata Extract). Beware those who are acne-prone."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,healed my pimple scars faster than usual,"I hv combination skin: oily t-zone + dry elsewhere. The first 2 weeks felt like my dry skin is being coated with a thin oily layer of the creme. It just sits on top of my skin and does nothing. Almost wanted to give this a 2 star rating but I persevered…after a while, my skin really learned to adapt to the formula and it seriously doesnt feel dry anymore. I can tell after cleansing my face. It doesnt feel tight unlike the first 2 weeks. In fact, I noticed that my pimple scars heals much faster now. Strong scent tho. Need to use clay mask every week to avoid clogged pores in humid Singapore. So for those who are trying for the first time, give it a chance for ur skin to readjust. There is a reason why this moisturizer is loved by many despite the insane price tag. For full transparency—I use estee lauder toner, advanced night serum and lamer soft creme as part of my day time routine. "
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,You can feel it working!,This product tightens the skin beautifully. You can feel it working! There's a bit of fragrance that can seem like a bit much. But it's worth it!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,nice scent and moisturizing ,"really love the scent of the product been using it for like a year now and i can say my skin has been improved by this product, although is on the expensive side but is highly recommended to use if you would want to try something new ! "
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Amazing,"I was a complimentary from  La Mer.  I  would like to start with , its true  a lil does a go along away . I do feel my skin more moisturized. And it is good for combination skin. I am prone to pimples and i must say it didn't bring any out but brightness and  soft skin. It does absorb quick and is light weight . I do use it at night more  since at day i use my sunscreen.  . It has turn in to my favorite product for everyday."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Canada,Buy this if the original is too heavy for you,I love La Mer line. People always compliment on how great my skin looks and asks me my secret and my response is La Mer. I love the original cream for night time but this one is great for day time or others that find the original too heavy. Your skin will look radiant and moisturizing using any La Mer products
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Hydration at the highest level,"This moisturizing cream contains the best ingredients of which we can highlight the Miracle Broth, lime tea, hydrating spheres, without parabens or sulfates, this excellent combination makes the skin stay firmer, hydrated, strengthened and protected. This cream has a smooth and light texture that absorbs quickly into my skin which makes me love it more, with a small amount it is enough to cover the face so it will make it last longer. Since I started using it my skin looks fantastic, healthier, feels very soft, hydrated and beautiful. I am fascinated with the results in so few days that I have been using it. 
I received this product complimentary from La Me."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Strong Fragrance,"I like how easily the product goes on the skin and how well it hydrates without having to use a large amount. I have sensitive skin and this did not irritate me in any way although I did worry at first due to the heavy fragrance that almost seemed perfume like. The scent is pleasent but it is definitely present. I will say though this is hydrating it can feel a little heavy or slippery as it dries/gets absorbed but after a few minutes it settles into the skin extremely well. Overall I did enjoy it but I'm not too crazy about the scent. 
I did receive this complimentary from La Mer in exchange for my honest review."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,super hydrating,I was very excited to try my complimentary from La Mer Soft Moisturizing Cream because my skin is dry & lack of moisture. Its a very lightweight formula with a clean scent. MY skin absorbs it quickly and I feel so hydrated when my skin absorbs it. I had no allergic reactions and was able to add to my skincare routine.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,like the texture better ,"I like the texture of the soft cream better than the original formulation. Absorbs better and doesn’t leave as much of a sticky residue. However, despite finishing the jar, I didn’t notice any significant changes to my face. Probably will not repurchase "
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer - 30ml,"La Mer has an iconic luxe vibe to it and they gifted me the Moisturizing Soft Cream is no different.

LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Heals my skin,"This luxury product that ive been dying to try was gifted by La Mer. Guess what?! It meets my expectations! Occasionally I get eczema on my hands and none of the products ive tried were able to address the problem until I used La Mer ""The Moisturizing Soft Cream"". This product decreases my flair ups and softens my skin. La Mer definitely heals my skin. A little goes along way and as someone who desperately needs to cure eczema I will buy this product because its the best compared to other alternatives such as medicated steroid creams."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Broke me out,"tl;dr: soothing and moisturizing, but broke me out badly. Also not worth the very high price.
I got a free sample of this to try.
I have oily, acne prone skin with some sensitivity, but was feeling a bit dry over night. Went on nice and thick, and really did increase my hydration for the next morning. After a few days I was noticing less redness around my nose, but then about a week after that, I started breaking out badly. Red, inflamed papules everywhere, way worse than normal. Stopped the cream (was almost out anyway), they cleared up and haven't been back."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer - 30ml,"When I first use this cream gifted by La Mer, I feel like I’m putting a light silk on my face.

It's lightweight texture is beautiful and soft of the skin.  It doesn't take much and I absolutely love how supple my skin looks.  It's so nice on the skin!  I would definitely recommend if you are looking for something light weight for Summer!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,A great moisturizer for all skin types,"I was really surprised by the LaMer moisturizer, which was gifted by LaMer. It’s extremely light weight yet did the job in moisturizing my skin. (I am combo /oily). I have been using it in the morning and night and you only need a small amount to get the job done. I’m on prescription derm meds right now and the LaMer moisturizer does not conflict with it. Pores and texture are issues for me and finding a moisturizer that does not enhance it so this is A+."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Love it,"I received it complimentary from La Mer. I tried the small version of this cream and I love it!
It gives a lot of moisture to skin, but does not leave oily feeling after. Feels so fresh and a little bit cool on skin.
I really loved, the down side is the price though"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Amazing,Such an amazing product.  My skin looks 10 years younger.  Not only is it lightweight also even though have a small amount it is going to last forever.  Smell is light and don't feel like junking up my face.  Love it.  I received this product gifted by La Mer for unbiased review.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,A classic for a reason,"I was recently received the moisturizing soft cream complimentary from La Mer. The cream has a lovely, velvety feel and immediately absorbs into the skin. Despite having a rich feel, it is surprisingly lightweight. My skin felt moisturized, yet never greasy or oily. The texture is balanced enough that I didn’t feel concerned about this being too rich and clogging my pores. A little bit of this cream goes a long way. My skin looks and feels healthier in the several days that I have been using this moisturizing soft cream. There is a reason La Mer is a long time classic brand used by both celebrities and the general population."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer - 30ml,I absolutely love this moisturizer cream by la mer. It goes on so smoothly and doesn't leave my face feeling oily or dirty afterwards. My skin has been really dry lately and this stuff has been great at helping my face become moisturized again. My face feels so soft & smooth. Gifted by la mer
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Love it,"I received this as a complimentary from LA Mer, and I really love it, it has a really soft fragrance, the texture is super light, you don't need tons because spread really nice , I can't tell what it is exactly,  but ,I love my skin in the morning , also go really well before apply makeup."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Cream Moisturizer,USA,Lightweight But Ultra Moisturizing,"La Mer gifted me their Moisturizing Soft Cream in exchange for my honest review.  This was my first experience with this brand, and it definitely won't be my last.  It's a lightweight cream, but ultra hydrating on my dry skin. Just a little bit morning and night goes a long way to heal dryness and strengthen the skin's barrier.  It has a pleasant light fragrance, and after just a few weeks I've noticed my complexion is more radiant and youthful, with fine lines and wrinkles less noticeable."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,Malaysia,Not a fan,"It is too thick and sticky. felt more like a lotion instead of a moisturizer for skin. and the smell is overpowering, not suitable for night use if you dont like perfumed skincare. will not repurchase "
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,This product is being discontinued,This product is being discontinued. I read rumors of it so I emailed Kopari and the confirmed it. I would not recommend this product because they are discontinuing it.
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,Canada,Like haven,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) If you love clean beauty and vegan products this. This moisturizer smells like paradise with sweet coconut milk scent and jasmine. When apply the body butter it feels soft and lightweight.
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,Canada,yes!!,"Soooo nice and light. I've used Kopari for 2-3 years now and have really liked it as an AM moisturizer. The cream isn't really scented imo, and it's a really nice texture that's easy to smooth on with fingers. The finish is a little dewy and sits well under a light powder foundation or a cream blush.  I've used this in dry and humid climates and liked it in both. A little goes a long way - this moisturizer strikes me as being a bit expensive but I only need to buy one tube per year as I use less than a pea-sized amount each day. Good for sensitive skin! My skin really likes coconut as an ingredient and this helps promote a glow. Would be lovely if Kopari made an SPF version but layering the Coconut Face Cream with a sunscreen works well too. The downside is that it's hard to find in the UK but if need be I will have this mailed to me from North America!!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,Australia,Super Hydrating,"This product has done amazing for my skin, I suffer from eczema and although it’s not advertised to help treat eczema it has helped rehydrate my skin immensely. "
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,Canada,okay,"Il est sa job, hydrater mais c'est tout! Il sent bon par exemple."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,good— but not amazing,"I was completely blown away by Kopari’s rose/coconut toner so I decided to try other products— this is a solid light weight face cream. I like the consistency as it is not too heavy and spreads evenly. The smell is mildly reminiscent of butterscotch— it’s not that I mind it, but it’s a little weird. Not sure that I’d repurchase. I’ll definitely use it but It’s not my holy grail face creams"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Not the best,Has a strange faint smell and leaves a greasy residue on my skin. Disappointed.
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,The Best!,"One of the best, if not THE best, face cream I have ever used. It melts in to your skin leaving you fresh faced and moisturized. Not sticky. Not tacky. Not goopy. It hydrates all day and gives your skin a beautiful glow."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,Canada,Great smell and finish!,"I tried this product originally in a sample pack. I liked it so much that I bought it in full. I love the smell and the finish after a minute or so is really nice. At first after applying it has a sort of sticky feeling, but this goes away quickly. I do think that it is a bit heavily priced for the size of the bottle, but a little goes a long way."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,in love,"I was skeptical with my pregnant combination skin and oily t zone but I absolutely love this stuff. Goes on great, smells freaking amazing and doesn't break me out! makes me happy every time I put it on! been using it for a week!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,Canada,"Dry skin, buh-bye","This cream is really amazing, I got it when it was on sale, almost half the price. I thought it was the good moment to try it and I w as not disappointed at all. My skin really feel hydrated and have not been dry since I use it.  I'm very happy with it and look forward to buy it again, even at the full price. In my case, this cream really is worth the money."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,Canada,hydrating like to other!,"My skin loves coconut and it loves this cream. It is so cold, crisp and my skin drinks it up. Doesn’t clog my skin or pores, I just wish it came in a bigger version!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,A holy grail moisturizer,"I have dry acne-prone skin, and it's so hard to find moisturizers that really hydrate my skin and prevent dry patches. This is one of my absolute favorites, and it's not too heavy either. I tend to get minor breakouts on my chin when I use other moisturizers, but this one is the best of both worlds. It feels really soothing and nourishing on the skin, and I love that its clean. My only complaint is the price, but one bottle probably lasts me around 5 months so it's certainly not terrible."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Amazingly Soothing,I have stress eczema and this really calms my skin and makes it glows. It makes my skin feel so soft. Cooling and restorative it sinks in right away with no greasy feeling. I use it under another moisturizer sort of as a serum and it been wonderful!
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,its alright,"I really wanted to like this. The ingredients are great, the packaging is great, but this just isn't hydrating enough. Maybe you'll like it if you're oily or prefer very light face creams."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,Canada,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,A little definitely goes a long way. One of the better face creams I’ve come across however I found that my face started to feel a little dry after about 8 hours which was easily resolved by pairing it with an hyaluronic serum. I found the consistency closer to a gel cream and not as rich and buttery as the description mentioned. Surprised that it was not as greasy as I would have assumed a coconut oil moisturizer to be and have gotten compliments on my skins appearance since I started using it.
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,Canada,hydratation parfaite,elle est très hydratante et rafraîchissante. donne un beau teint. ne donne pas de boutons.
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,recommend for dry and/or sensitive skin,"I’ve bought this twice, the first time during the winter and gave it to my mom when she came to visit because even though I liked it, I was worried it would be to thick for warmer months. The second time I bought it was this spring when my pregnancy turned my fairly oily t-zone into a painfully dry area (the entire T zone! It was awful). I used this day and night after washing my face and it works great at soothing my sensitive skin."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,The Best!,"The fact that this moisturizer changes consistency depending on your skin needs tells it all. I travel a ton for work and this moisturizer is perfect for keeping up with the change in climates without making me break out. I've compared this to my Tatcha water cream and Drunk Elephant Polypeptide cream and as amazing as both of those products are, they can't keep up with how flexible this cream is with it's Hydrating formula."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,"1 FL OZ tube lasted a month for me using it day and night. TEXTURE: lightweight, whipped, non-greasy, absorbed quickly, comfortable and feels very nourishing on the skin. WEAR: moisturizing but it does not last my 10-hour work shift, my skin gets a bit shiny by end of the day so it does not completely balance it. INGREDIENTS: quite the long list, plant extracts. MOM APPROVED!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,,Smells really good,"I love how this product smells, a very light coconut scent that i can still smell on my face for a while after using . it’s very lightweight, and i love it. will try more of kopari’s products "
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Best Moisturizer through all Seasons,"I started using this moisturizer in the winter when my skin was dry, red, and irritated from dermatitis. This was the only moisturizer that did not irritate my skin with terrible chemicals. Even in the summer when my skin is more oily and wants something light this moisturizer does the trick. This moisturizer is perfect for all skin types and all seasons!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,"Good Product, non greasy.","I was surprised at how much i love this face cream. I typically use very expensive face moisturizers and a friend had given this to me. Trying it, i was very surprised how much it really soaked into my skin. It's non greasy and there is not a strong scent. I am prone to breakouts and haven't had any switching to this. I really love it and just bought my second tube."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,,Average,"As the title suggests, this is pretty average. It does moisturise a little but I don't feel like it does anything amazing for my skin. I'll finish what I have but won't be re purchasing."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,,Very nice ,"Perfect for anyone that likes a light to medium moisturizer that smells like coconut. Didn't break out my skin but if wearing underneath liquid foundation and your skin is already oily it might make you a bit too oily. Using a smaller amount on drier areas could fix that. Overall though, it is a really nice standard face cream."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,CLEAN product,"I have normal to dry skin and this face cream does not help me. I dont feel hydrated, despite it being water based. The cream just sits on my skin. I should have known better, because coconut’s molecular structure is too big for it too penetrate deeply. It kind of just sits on your skin, atleast that’s the the case for me. I like the cream but it didnt do much for me. If you are looking for a moisturizer to mix with your foundation to create a more sheer coverage you can try this, because it’s a clean product. Also the cream has no color or sheen to it, it’s a matte texture cream. It contains no silicone or harsh irritants. Very clean skincare but did not work for me. Overall, very effective packaging (love the bottle shape and traditional dispenser, more brands should stick to this type of packaging instead of jars), but I would be interested in a different base oil for a future face cream- maybe argan oil or something more penetrative, rather than coconut."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,a coconut dream !,"I LOVE this face cream ! It’s my second tube and still love it! It’s clean, it smells good but natural, and for the price, 75ml is gooood ! The cream just sinks into the skin like a dream. It stays a lil dewy, but dry down nicely after maybe 3 min. Having a really dry skin, this is really helping hard since i am using it! I noticed a smoother application of makeup and reaallllly fines lines being gone !"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,,Love this product,5 stars! Love this product and have already bought it again. It is ideal for day and night if you like a lightweight cream that soaks well into your skin. It has a lovely subtle coconut aroma.
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Just perfect,"The best face moisturizer anyone can get!! Free from toxic and harsh ingredients, dyes, paraben, silicone, phthalates, etc. Would highly recommend to everyone. Does not irritate and provide the right amount of moisture."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,saved my face this winter,This cream totally saved my face this winter. I found it to be too heavy over the summer time when I bought it but as soon as it got cold and dry I couldn’t get enough. 100% will be purchasing again
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,"for the price, doesn’t deliver","I really wanted to love this face cream because the scent was great and I love coconut-based products. But the oil did not absorb into my face after hours of leaving it on. I have extremely dry skin so I thought I would give it a try and it won’t make my skin greasy. Unfortunately, it did just that. I thought maybe if I used less then it wouldn’t leave a such a greasy film, but then I realized it wasn’t moisturizing enough. I used it twice or three times but it is gonna go back :/"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Might be THE ONE for acne prone skin,I took this cream to travel with me and used it day and night for about 4 days. And I noticed blemishes around my chin area faded faster. I can’t say it was 100% because of the cream but that was the only thing new in my skincare routine so maybe it was. I will definitely continue using it. So far I’m quite happy with it. If it really does help with acne I will be so hyped since my chin breaks out often. The only thing I will say is it’s not working too well with the new foundation I’m trying out because the cream is definitely not a matte one. I’m going to use it at night only and use a mattifying moisturizer during the day under makeup.
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,I used the whole bottle before writing this. I have acne prone skin and this did not cause me to break out. I did go through the whole bottle very quickly which is why I won’t repurchase it as it’s 50 bucks.  My skin was soft and hydrated and it was good!
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,I really like this. Nice and light but still really hydrating. The scent could be better but that’s about the only thing I’d change!
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Not for oily/combo skin types,"I have combo/oily skin and tried using this face cream regularly and it broke me out!! So disappointed because I like everything else about it. It’s very hydrating so I used it only in the evenings at first - no breakouts. When I started using it regularly (AM/PM) it really messed with my already oily skin :/ it’s a shame, but I need to just give it away to a friend now.."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,Love this moisturizer. It soaks into your skin nicely without leaving it greasy. My skin is ULTRA sensitive and this does not irritate it or make me break out. I also love that it is unscented.
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Amazing!,"Amazing product. Leaves me hydrated but not overly so. I have oily skin that can become dry, this face cream creates the perfect balance for my skin. Also, my skin is very sensitive and prone to burning from many lotions and creams, that has never happened with Kopari face cream! Love this product and it smells super fresh."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,GREAT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN,"Non-irritating, great at bedtime and mositurises my dry, sensitive, winter flaky skin.  Great beneath the eyes over serum."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,breakouts galore,"I have extremely dry skin, but this cream doesn’t seem to absorb into the skin. This tends to be a problem with coconut oil, I was hoping that it would still work because I liked the ingredients otherwise. I believe this cream made me breakout in tiny bumps, which I don’t usually have. 

Will be returning, would’ve been decent or even a good cream if it was less than $30, but for this price I think there are better options."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,Really disappointed. It left my face feeling oily and heavy but didn’t moisturize my skin and left flakey spots. Not worth the price at all
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Perfect,"This is the best moisturizer I’ve ever used and I’ve tried so so many. It works on combo skin so well, isn’t greasy, helps heal dry patches, calmed eczema, and prevented acne. It also feels soft and is lightweight."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Love It,"Keeps skin hydrated and smooth all day, perfect if you wanna go natural but it also works well with makeup. You only need to use a very small quantity, even for the drier skin types, and I wouldn't recommend it for oilier skin types."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,lightweight,This is a great moisturizer.  It is very lightweight but still moisturizes well. I use it in the morning and it works well under makeup (but make sure to add spf in). If you have dry skin however you may want something heavier for night . But for everyday use this is my new go to .
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,You won’t regret,"Amazing! Melts into skin and leaves it feelings baby soft! Smell is mild and effect is magical! After a shower, this face cream feels like a cloud on the face. I usually use a face scrub cleanser by origins in the shower and my face doesn’t get red after applying this face cream directly after. Moisture lasts for days."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,So good!,"I use this with a few serums, my skin feels awesome! I can tell a real difference in the ability of ingredients to penetrate since getting this- I'm so glad it's silicone free! I reccomend combining this with a hylarunoic serum and or a ceramid serum (or both like me). My skin feels incredibly soft and even."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,not especially moisturizing,This was drying. It didn’t break me out though.
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,"Very good, I will re-purchase!","I really like this moisturizer!  I have dry winter skin that gets easily irritated during these months.  It goes on very light (not greasy at all), a little goes a long way and it doesn't irritate my skin or make me breakout.  The smell is very very light and pleasant and I like that there aren't a lot of chemicals in this (no silicone which I appreciate).  It seems to give my skin a nice glow afterwards too.  I will be buying this again when I run out."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,recommended,"Thick.
Smells alright!
Better than the green tube."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Fave coconut face cream,"I was on the hunt for a new moisturizer that was hydrating, lightweight, and had the ""Clean at Sephora"" seal. I decided to try the Kopari coconut face cream because of the known benefits of coconut oil. My first impression was that the smell was so lovely. It has become my favorite part of putting on this moisturizer. I love it! I also enjoy that the texture of it does not feel greasy or too thick. It really feels lightweight! And even if the amount inside may seem small, you don't need a lot to completely moisturize your face."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Too thin,I have combination skin... this product wasn’t moisturizing enough for the dry parts on my face. The consistency is pretty thin.
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,This lotion was really greasy and did nothing for my skin.
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,love ittttt,"I have bought and used two bottles of this already. So in love with the product. It’s texture feels heavy at first but once you rub it in it gives the perfect amount of hydration without leaving a “film”’of product. Absorbs wonderfully. And it last so long a little really goes a long way! I have very sensitive skin with rosacea around my mouth and this does not irritate it one bit, I find it actually soothes it. LOVE!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Soooo hydrating,"I have been using this product for about a week day and night and am already obsessed! I have extremely dry skin that makes me feel disgusting. I have used a TON of moisturizers in the past, and almost all of them do that nasty “pilling” on my face. I do not have that issue with this one! I love how lightweight this feels on my skin but also how soft and hydrated my skin feels upon application! Even my boyfriend has commented on how lovely my skin looks and that’s a huge compliment! I will definitely repurchase! If your skin is so dry you feel like a reptile I would recommend this!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,Sorry but I didn’t feel any difference in my skin.  Will return it.  Found something better!!!
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,"I got this product as a sample and gave it a try as my AM moisturizer. On the first day I loved the smell as I applied it, however after application found my skin incredibly oil and glossy. I normally have dry/normal skin and have never wiped my face and felt such a film on it. I tried it a couple more times after using face masks
 to see if that would help, same reaction. By the end of day 3 with this product I broke out on my forehead, normally I do not break out in this area. I wanted to love this product, however this product definitely wasn’t right for me."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,New Favourite!,"I got this as a sample, and I’m definitely going back for the full size soon! This cream is unbelievably rich, yet it absorbs so quickly without leaving my skin greasy. It smells very strongly of coconut and coconut oil, which I love! My skin feels so soft and smooth after using it!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,"I really love the refreshing coconut smell of this product. Most moisturizers I’ve tried either leave a stickiness to my face after use, are too heavy, or too watery but this was the perfect weight for me. My skin felt so soft and smooth after each use. Definitely give this a try with the Kopari Coconut Your Selfie Kit that lets you try almost all of Kopari’s skincare products."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Great daily moisturizer,Nice light formula and nice light scent. I just switched from Estée Lauder to this. I really like how light weight and absorbing this is! The scentbus also clean and non lingering which I love. Would recommend.
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Broke my skin out,At first I loved how moisturized my face felt but it broke me out! Wanted to love it but not for my skin.
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,"This moisturizer smells good, it’s creamy and moisturizing, and it absorbs quickly. I’m so glad I decided to try it!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,10/10,"I got this in the mail as a little sample packet, and I loved it. It kept my face moisturized and it smelled amazing. I can't wait to buy the full thing. Not only was it great on my best friends face (who has acne), but it was amazing on mine and I have extremely dry skin. It wasn't heavy to put on and it glided around my face easily. With a small little dime-sized amount, it got my driest areas of my face without feeling like I put on 4 pumps of moisturizer. I'm currently using josie maran argan oil cream, and they are both amazing together. I use the argan oil in the daytime and I used the coconut cream at night.

Amazingly, it doesn't give you that overwhelming coconut smell. I'm not the biggest fan of coconut, but this changed my mind. I LOVE IT!! Best part, no matter how much you use, even if you accidently put too much on, it won't overwhelm you with the smell. And in just the three days I used the sample, it cleared a small patch of my dry skin with ease."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,best of the best,"I have combo skin. the oily is super slick and the dry is super flakey. I typically use Kiehls yellow bottle oil during the day and the Midnight Recovery oil at night no matter what. I started using this day and night over the oils and I'm in love! I love that its ""clean"" and good for your skin. I love how creamy it is at first, it feels very luxurious. then it absorbs and makes your skin so soft without any residue. its great under my foundation too (estee lauder doublewear) and I don't get oily during the day. I don't even have to blot. this is my new holy grail staple."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,Doesn't smell like coconut and too greasy
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,"While this smells lovely, it is so so so heavy. Perhaps you get used to the thickness after a while, but honestly, not for me."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,Love this line!  The cream is just the right consistency and I can use it day or night.  We
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,love love love,"Love love love, was introduced to the line on vacay in Maui, so happy to find at Sephora, amazing on my skin. Have dry skin as always outside, it smells nice, non greasy and skin is soft. 
Wish the coffee scrub would come to sephora canada its amazing!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,"After using this for about 3 weeks, I gotta say I'm not that impressed with the outcome. I have a strange combination type skin, oily but dry. This seems to keep my skin hydrated while it's on, but once it's off my skin is flaking and tight and dry. Not sure if it's the fault of the oil cleanser or just my skin. It doesn't really change how oily my skin is though, it's still about the same. Maybe not what you need with oily skin, but it keeps me from feeling dry and dead. I also noticed my skin hasn't really seemed to clear up, I was hoping a more natural product could keep my pores cleaner. The scent is a little odd when I first started using it, but I have grown to like it. It smells very, earthy, I suppose. No fragrances is nice sometimes."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Does not smell nice,"Being called coconut face cream I thought it smelled like coconut, and it doesn't. It actually doesn't smell like anything and, since I like scented products, I wasn't impressed. It does leave a velvety sensation on the skin, but it is too heavy. I got a free sample and will not be purchasing."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,love!,"I have been suffering with a rash from the sun/heat on my arm that flares up when I am outside for long periods. Id been treating it with coconut oil. I forgot to bring it camping and it flared up badly. I decided to try the Kopari cream - to my surprise it not only calmed it, it cleared it completely over night! 
The smell is nice and light.
The texture is great. Nice and heavy but not greasy!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Not for me.,"I tried a mini of this from a kit. It's a nice texture and doesn't smell too strongly of anything, but I couldn't get past the film I felt like it left on my skin. I didn't enjoy it any of the three times I tried it. I'll prob use it up on my legs. :)"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Natural,"Such a simple but amazing face cream. Not a strong sent, feels great!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,good product,"I was hesitant to try a new facial moisturizer but I'm glad I did. this stuff has a lovely light scent, really hydrating, so a little goes a long way."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,Light and gives good hydration!! Good for summer!
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,"Amazing, soft and not greasy! Goes so well with the toner!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,"Hands down the best face moisturizer I have ever used. I have somewhat dry, sensitive, acne prone skin and this has changed it all. It allows my makeup to go on smoothly and I wake up with glowing skin in the morning."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Hydrating,"This face cream is so amazingly hydrating! I'm seventeen, and my skin is sort of combination-like, but it definitely gets dry during certain times of the year. This feels very natural on my skin while still providing the moisture that I want. It's perfect before makeup! It smells AMAZING!!! If you love coconuts/Kopari, you will adore this!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,"Lightly scented and doesn't feel heavy on your skin. You only need a tiny amount to cover your face and it soaks in quickly, no residue left over! No breakouts and my skin has never been softer."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,Very moisturizing. A little goes a long way which I love! Great product.
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Obsessed,"Amazing for my eczema prone skin, this moisturiser is amazing, i was skeptical because it has coconut oil in it, and i usually shy away from oil since it can clog pores and cause break outs, but this is different, it sinks right into the skin making it feel dewy and very hydrated, not sticky or greasy what so ever im so happy I found this product"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Love Kopari,My husband swears by this stuff.  It is literally the only face cream I have ever gotten him to use regularly.  He is addicted to Kopari.   I just wish it was sold in store as well.
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Wonderful,Absolutely in love with this product. I use it every morning after applying the coconut rose toner and then I apply my makeup. Will continuously repurchase!
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,yesss,Love the smell. Feels really good and hydrate the skin so well ❤️
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Dry Skin Oasis,"This is a nice moisturizer for dry skin. I have combination skin and I run in to ""over grease"" look when I apply this on too thick OR when I use with all 3 of the steps (Kopari face wash, toner and the lotion.)  <--Not sure why

Over all I will keep buying this product and switch between one of my other moisturizers I really like from Sephora! :)"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,This has been a great traveling companion because it serves so many purposes. I use it in the morning and before bed at night. Perfect for hydrating that dry skin that seems to come every time I step on a plane.
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Wowza,My new Obsession! I have been using a very expensive cream for the past 8 years and after 1 month of usinh Kopari it has been a game changer!! What is even better.... it is a Clean product without all of the parabens and junk!!! I am so glad they expanded to skincare... YOU MUST TRY IT..... I promise
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari just keeps getting better!,"I have been using Kopari products for over a year now and I was so excited about their new face line, although a little apprehensive due to the fact  that  I usually only use face products from my plastic surgeons office.  I could not have been more happy with results.  Not only does it give my face an instant glow but I have noticed over the past 2 weeks my face looking a little ""younger"" !  There is no other way to describe!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,Give it time to dry and you will LOVE it!
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,"Love the feel of it, but it made me break out!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,My holy grail,"I cannot live without this face cream ever again. I have super combination skin, some parts really oily and others literally flaking off. This moisturizer is the first thing that has balanced my skin out and made it smooth, even and happy! It smells great, absorbs quickly, and goes on great under a full face of makeup. I use it at least twice a day and my skin has never been better! <3"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,"I really wanted to like this cream, but I found it to be too greasy for my skin.  I tried using it on two separate occasions for a prolonged period of time (once in warmer weather and again when it got cold) and ended up with whiteheads all over my face each time.  Too greasy for me, but might work better for people with really dry skin?  It's definitely very moisturizing!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,soft and light! perfect alone or under makeup,"I was introduced to Kopari’s Skin Care line when a friend of mine posted on their insta story. I first ordered their
Gift set which includes the entire skincare line in travel size. I have combination skin (oily tzone). This cream is lightly scented and very light all over the skin. No sticky residue leaving your skin smooth. I use this all year round during any season. It’s become a staple in my skincare regimen."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Amazing,"This moisturizer is amazing. I was worried it would be greasy since it's based off coconut oil, it's not at all! Most skincare products take a few days to notice results. Within an hour after the moisturizer has been absorbed I noticed my skin already felts softer. The next morning it was still very soft. I highly recommend!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Love this cream!,"Hydrating, absorbs into the skin, no silicones, pleasant scent!  Love this so much!"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Disappointed,"Bought after reading many positive reviews on this product. I love the smell of coconut but was displeased with the strong scent that was in this cream. It didn't have a natural or even sweet fragranced coconut scent that I was expecting. I'm typically not sensitive to scents but this was a little too overpowering for me. I was willing to overlook this if the product worked well, but sadly I did not notice a difference in my skin after use. The cream felt lightweight but did not absorb into my skin at all. I have combination skin for reference. Not worth the price for me. I ended up retuning the product."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Love it,I have been using this for a week and I am already in love. It absorbs instantly and feels silky smooth. The fragrance is very light and pleasant and not irritating in the least. I already have an email reminder set up to let me know when the stock is replenished so I can order a backup!
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,"Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful!","I wanted to try something more light weight in the morning after washing my face and did not expect to love this as much as I do. At first the product feels almost a little like sunscreen when squeezed onto the palm, but once I applied it on my face it had an easy and watery, smooth application. It leaves my face looking hydrated and dewy (more-so than products basically marketed to make skin dewy). Once it's on it feels light, airy and absorbs quickly. It gives a youthful luster to the skin. For the price, it's amazing. I will continue to use this as a new staple to my skincare."
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Best all around face cream,I LOVE this face cream.  I'm really picky about what I put on my face so when I started using this cream I was shocked at how light and non greasy this formula was.  Definitely good for sensitive skin.  Highly recommended
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari Coconut Face Cream,"Doesn't smell like coconut, just an odd scent to me. An okay face cream, nothing too special...almost feel like a drug store face lotion"
KOPARI-Coconut Face Cream,USA,Kopari's Skincare Line is a MUST-TRY!,"It's hard to choose a favorite from the Kopari skincare line, but I think this one comes close to first place. I love using this in the morning after cleansing, and it's not heavy on the skin at all. I like that it has a mostly-matte finish after it dries, which is a perfect base before applying makeup. If you want silky smooth skin, try this product out!"
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,It's okay but certainly not great,"I wanted to love this cream but I didn't find it suitable for aging skin. It is quite heavy when applied and is not suited for all year round use. Maybe in winter if your skin needs something heavier to protect it from the elements but aside from that, it's not that great."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Extreme hydration,"This product is amazing! This is my 3rd time buying it I love it so much, if you dont mind fragrant moisturize definitely give this one a try. A small amount goes a long way! This is a must-have in winter"
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Malaysia,nice and not too thick,Been using it as day cream. Its not heavy. So its suitsble for daytime. My skin feels so moisturise everyday. The smell not too strong and very nice so im ok with that. 
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Would definitely recommend!,"Pros: Honey (moisturizes), peptides and collagen(provide skin firmness and youthfulness ). Not to heavy, absorbs nicely w/o greasy feel. Cream  based. Light honey smell. 
Cons: none"
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,To smelly,"I can’t get past the bad smell. It smells like the cleaner used in gas station bathrooms. Not very pleasant. It does absorb quickly, but the smell lingers for a while."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,New Zealand,LOVE,"Love this moisturiser have purchased multiple times now, my go to! It smells delicious and glides on so smoothly. My favourite moisturiser so far worth the price!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Just okay!,"I like this moisturizer but I don't love it. I think it's good at moisturizing but that's really all I can say about it. I personally didn't feel like it did much extra for my skin and isn't really worth the price point. I've finished my jar and don't plan to repurchase. 
Don't get me wrong there isn't anything bad about it however I do feel like there are other moisturizers for less money that are more beneficial to the skin. If you have sensitive combo skin its a fine lightweight moisturizer I just expected a little more from it."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Singapore,clogged my pores,"Was looking forward to this moisturiser but after just 3 days I start to get bumps and it clogged my pores. I know it's from this as nothing else changes in my routine. It's also not very moisturising so if you have dry skin, might want to stay away from this. "
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Singapore,amazing ,"Wishful products have never failed me not once! I have been using this for the past 3 months nightly. Now i rarely get big juicy pimple on my face, isn’t that great?!? After applying you’ll definitely feel moisturise. Its not sticky either which is great:)"
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,already ordered a backup,Love how gentle and hydrating this moisturizer is on my dry sensitive skin. Feels luxurious and absorbs beautifully!
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,"I absolutely love this moisturizer!!
I have oily to combination skin, this moisturizer doesn’t make me look oily and it moisturizers my skin perfectly."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,LOVE THIS ,Definitely the nicest moisturises out there the collagen in a definitely boost my skin I noticed my skin beam brighter and feeling plumped up I just wish that it would come in a bigger size but that’s alright because a little bit does go along way love it definitely should buy it
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,Skin is so nice from this! ,My skin has loved this moisturiser. I have tried others but always come back to this! Smells lovely and feels very hydrating. Definitely a go to moisturiser for me 
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Smells like fabuloso,"I really wanted to love it. Its lightweight, absorbs well, does not irritate my skin but the smell is just AWFUL. Took me a few uses to figure out what it reminded me of and its freaking fabuloso. Without the scent? 4 stars because I need a heavier evening moisturizer for my dry skin and I bought this to be a night moisturizer for summer. Wth the scent? 2 stars.  Terrible."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,"The formula, packaging, and wear is perfect. This is a very creamy formula that my skin eats. Absolutely one of my favorite moisturizers."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,This is the best moisturizer,If your looking for one with no greasy feel. I wear this before bed and it feels like my skin sucked it up and is left feeling hydrated. Very expensive and it goes fast for me cause I can’t stop using it. Highly reccomend
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Amazing!,No horrible smell!! I felt really clean and my skin felt AMAZING after using it for a few days. i highly recommend!!
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,good but not great,"Absorbs quick, smells good to me (I can get what people are saying about floor cleaner but also I think that’s being a bit overboard) I don’t know if I’ve seen it provide any results but for the meantime it’s pretty good as a lightweight moisturizer."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,All the Stars!!! love love love,I’m so happy I found this from a deluxe sample! I’ve tried so many face creams & this is the best day cream I’ve found! The Honey whip is perfect to me because it smells amazing like I’m obsessed and it hydrates and absorbs so nice! It goes perfect with make up and goes great with my serums! I look forward this face cream! Right On Huda! Please never discontinue so I can buy forever!
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,Very bad for oily skin and made me break out and does not wear well under makeup. This product only benefits dry skin. It was a no for me.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,Amazing ,OMG im in loveeeeee ! Honey whip moisturizer made my skin real smooth and felt amazingly plump and refreshed just in couple days i can literally feel the difference. It definitely does work wonder ❤️ worth your money 
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,a must try,This is the BEST moisturizer I have ever used for my dry skin. Just went through the whole product and will be buying again !!! I have tried so many moisturizers and this is the only one that didn’t break me out and kept my skin hydrated even under my make up.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,nothing special. quite watery,I wanted to try this & was excited when it arrived but even though it smells ok it isn’t anything special for me. Admittedly I have dry skin and I found it to be too thin/almost watery. I wish it was a bit thicker like the honey balm they make- one of my favorites. I wouldn’t ever purposely pick it again.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,caused breakouts for me,"I liked the texture & it was easy to apply.  It didn't seem to soak in well, so my face felt a little greasy but did not appear moisturized.  Each time it made my chin break out so I used the rest on my arms."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Smells like Toilet Bowl Cleaner,This product has a wonderful consistency but it smells like toilet bowl cleaner. I had to wash my face and hands after applying it bc I could not stop smelling that.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Singapore,Try,Bought this product during Sephora Beauty Pass Sales period to try it out as I saw plenty of reviews exclaiming how awesome this product is. Pretty packaging too.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Not for me,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Unfortunately didn't work for my skin.
Got this in samples, would not bye full size. Cream is thick, which I thought was nice given the cold weather, however it didn't absorb well, felt like it was sitting on top of skin and looked greasy; skin itself felt tight and in need of moisture."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Meh,"Not bad. Not good, either. It’s just meh. A little heavy and greasy feeling, but at the same time you don’t really feel moisturized, just coated.
I guess what I’m trying to say is it’s a heavy moisturizer that doesn’t sink into the skin well. At least on me. 
I prefer IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Surprisingly good,I have used many moisturizers with peptides.  I really prefer this one.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Drying,it dried me out alot during the winter.. not a fan at allll
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,one of my favorites,This is my go to day moisturizer. I use this every day. This keeps my skin hydrated and moisturized. I have tried TONS of moisturizers and this is the only one that works for me.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,New Zealand,like,Giving at four stars because I don’t know if it actually does much for the skin but I like the way it feels and looks on the skin doesn’t cause oilyness with make up 
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,hydrating but also drying around t zone but that could just be me also a great base to put in before makeup as it hydrates and makes skin tacky
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,Received a sample and loved it enough to purchase a full size. The scent isn’t overwhelming but enjoyable. Leaves my skin feeling moisturized and glowing. Love it. It’s being added to the skin care regiment.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,very moisturizing,"I received this as a sample and ended up buying the actual product. It is light weight, but feels very moisturizing. I liked how the peptides were high up on the ingredient list! A little bit of this product goes a long way which I love since moisturizer can be expensive."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,melts into skin,"I got a sample of this and thought it was body cream at first because it was so thick. However, it literally melted into my skin and it feels great— so hydrated! I can count on one hand how many times I’ve been converted from a sample but this one got me! Like others have said, the smell is meh. Definitely chemically honey scented but it goes away fairly quickly.

Looking forward to ordering the full size now."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Smells Weird,I had a sample of this and it smells like comet cleaner. It's really bad. I thoughts it was a fluke and tried it again another day and it still smelled. It's so odd.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,Works well on my very sensitive red cracked rosacea. Soothing and perfectly thick for a heavier night cream
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,best moisturiser ,"this has the most smooth, thick buttery consistency, but rich enough that it doesn’t feel heavy nor greasy on the skin. my skin has never been smoother. layers greatly with any serum or even the get even rose oil. must purchase if your looking for a moisturiser "
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,amazing,"I love love love this! I was sure it was all just hype but I am so glad I purchased it. It smells amazing, my skin feels so smooth after and I actually look forward to my skincare routine now each day because of this product! "
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Smells like a household cleaning product,I received a sample of this and couldn't even put it on my face it smells so bad - like a household cleaning product. Yikes.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Works with my combo skin,"I have oily/normal skin and I’d say this moisturizer gives me the exact moisture I need for my skin! But I do wish there was just a little more moisture! That being said, this might not work if you have really dry skin. Also, there is a scent to it but it doesn’t bother me at all, I like it. And the packaging is meh. I prefer a pump because it feels more sanitary and I see myself picking up too much product sometimes since it’s in a tub. Overall, I’d recommend for those with my skin type and who aren’t sensitive to scents."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Just not for me.,"Not a fan. This may work for some other people and if it does thats awesome. This product made my skin so dry and flakey. I kept giving it a few more days thinking that my skin just needed to get used to it. Its highly perfumed and is so thick without any moisture at all. I do hope this works for you, it just wasn't for me."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,"Just ok, doesn’t hydrate my skin enough","It’s ok. It’s smooth and light, not oily BUT I still find I have dry skin after 4 weeks of using this. The product stings after a good exfoliation too. I don’t mind the scent, it reminds me of a tanning salon but it’s faint. I wouldn’t buy it again just based on 4 weeks of use and no improvement in my dry skin."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,New Zealand,Brilliant! ,Brilliant.. I have tried so many brands over the years and this one far exceeds the rest for me. I’m 32 and my skin has never felt and looked better! 
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Singapore,Lovely cream,"I love the consistency of the cream and the powerful ingredients packed in this little jar. It includes niacinemide, honey, and peptides - all my favourites! My face looks brighter after applying the cream. However, I don’t really enjoy the scent - it is a little too “sweet” / unnatural (hence one star off). Just a personal preference - I pay a lot of attention to the scent of my skincare products. I enjoy using those that are slightly and naturally scented and not too overpowering. Whilst I do like the product and the ingredients, I don’t think I will repurchase as I think there are similar products out there (with better “scents” and similar ingredients). "
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,"Really not great, & pore clogging","I really wanted to like it after seeing some wonderful Youtube reviews, but it really is nothing special. Very expensive for a very average product. It is also not non-comedogenic, so it does clog your pores unfortunately. I don’t have sensitive skin at all but it kept making my forehead breakout."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,doesn’t do a great job,"i find i have to apply it multiple times throughout the day to keep my face hydrated, which is a little annoying & waste of product. my skin feels great once i put it on, but a few hours later, it feels drier than it was before i put the moisturizer on"
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,SKIN SAVIOR,"This product is a literal game changer. I've used products from the new glow recipe plum plump cream to the tatcha dewy skin, but , they always burned the skin around my nose or made me feel a slight bit oily in my t zone when I was never oily. I've seen so many good reviews on this moisturizer but was skeptical due to trying the honey gel moisturizer last year and it not working out. Let me tell you, this stuff WORKS  ! It keeps me hydrated ALL DAY and I work out doors lol and it does not clog my pores or cause any breakouts what so ever. I highly reccomend this. the only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is due to me wishing there was more product in there buts it's definetly so worth the money!!!!"
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,"lovely texture, skin feels fuller and hydrated, non sticky and smells really good"
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Buy it!,My favorite moisturizer!!i use  it daily my skind feels soo soft and baby skin!
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,interesting,It’s not the most moisturizing but it really helps my acne prone skin (so far it’s been almost 2 weeks I’d say) it just makes over all texture and glow really nice (: definitely going to be good towards summer but I wouldn’t recommend for dry skin
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Elemis Dupe!!,"Hands down one of my favorite moisturizers! If you’re looking for a moisturizer that leaves your skin hydrated and plump for several hours, this is it!! I apply this one at night, and when I wake up the following morning my skin almost feels like it did after applying the moisturizer. It has a thicker consistency, but goes on smoothly and absorbs. It has a subtle fragrance as well. Also, if you’re looking for an Elemis dupe, this one comes pretty dang close!"
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,BEST moisturizer!,"This moisturizer is so light and fluffy, yet moisturizing -- it exceeded all my expectations! My face is left feeling baby soft after each time I use it. The scent is also very pleasant and not at all overwhelming. I'm in love!"
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Won’t be buying again,"I regret purchasing, it seems thick but yet doesn’t feel like it’s moisturizing my skin? Maybe it works better for others but I will not be repurchasing this."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,"nice moisturizer, just not for me","I have dry, very sensitive skin. This moisturizer feels great going on and smells nice…I just felt it didn’t hydrate my skin as much as my skin needs. If I’m comparing similar moisturizers around/near this price point, I reach for SkinFix triple lipid peptide moisturizer over this one every time."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) My skin literally craves this. This moisturizer has a decadent and silky texture it’s so luxurious! It has a subtle honey smell which I don’t mind at all. I got this as a sample and fell in love ever since. GET IT!
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Recommend for all dry skin and comibination skin!!,"I found this product as a sample in the beginning but then I bought the full size because it was so good! I really liked the texture of my skin after using this product, I have dry skin so this really helped me by giving a fully moisturized and firm feeling. I really like the smell too, the fragrance is very subtle, and overall, this is now my go-to moisturizer!"
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,"cannot rate highly enough, winner ","I had a sample of this and loved it so much I immediately bought a full-size. My normal-dry skin loves it, works as a perfect base for makeup and a thicker layer works it's magic overnight.  The scent is barely there, but beautiful - unlike the lavender-heavy abomination Wishful previously released.  Cannot recommend highly enough, HUDA/Wishful really upped their game with this one."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,New Zealand,Smells great,"Smells great, has lovely whipped texture and feels so nice on my skin. Good hydrating moisturizer but not sure of the long term benefits. Pricey but was a nice treat "
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,Soooo goood,"I got this in a small set and straight away bought the bigger set because i got addicted to this moisturizer. It melts into the skin like butter, is not too heavy and smells heavenly."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,love this,Love the smell and how hydrating this is. Doesn’t leave your skin feeling greasy. A little goes a long way so I find my jars last for months. Wish it wasn’t so expensive but it’s worth it.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,love love love,This is my new favorite moisturizer. It feels so soothing and absorbs into the skin really well. My skin looks more even and feels hydrated throughout the day. I only wish it came in a larger size!
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,Please never stop making this moisturizer! I am absolutely in love with it. It is the most beautiful texture and consistency without being overly thick and just sitting on the surface of your skin. OBSESSED.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,"Fantastic winter moisturizer! Thick and hydrating, but not greasy. Absorbs into skin well."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,"I liked this, but my skin is SUPER dry and I needed something just a tad bit thicker."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,New Zealand,mrs,Didn’t like the feel of it. Smell was not too my taste. However it did make my skin feel nice. So it does what it’s supposed to there are just ones I have used that I liked better than this
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,I bought this after reading reviews and decided to give it a try. I like it overall and have been using for over a month. I don’t think it has caused any breakouts and I feel like it hydrates well. Not sure how long it is going to last and I have mostly been using at night. I would probably purchase it again whenever I run out!
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Just wow,I received a travel size to try it out and wow. A little goes a long way and it's so hydrating. Not too thick nor too light it's just right.  Definitely gonna buy another.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,not for me,"Does the job but didn’t like the consisten. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a nice moisturizer with a honey feeling but not sure if I want that in a skincare"
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Please do not spend this much money!!!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Not a product anyone needs to spend this much money on. If you want a high end cream try anything else, this is heavily fragranced and feels like a cheap body lotion."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,Texture is great for day and night ,Initially liked the creamy medium thick texture of the product. A few weeks on I think I like the Go To moisturiser as it’s got a bit more of a nourishing oil feel on my ageing skin. I’ve used the same moisturiser for a while so wanted to use something different with peptides.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,my skin gets thirsty for it!!! FAV MOISTURIZER,"I am 34 and have tried EVERYTHING from olay to skinceuticals to OZ. I love Huda’s products. I have the wishful Jelly moisturizer and I do like and use it, if I’m extra dry- but it can be on the greasy side. The HONEY WHIP IS sooooooo gooooood. It goes on super light (even scent) and absorbs into the skin so fast, it’s like my skin is thirsty for it! Love love love."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,Just what my dry skin needs! I have VERY dry skin and this moisturizes without being greasy. Does not clog pores. Fair value for price
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,BUY IT ❤️,So I usually get the honey balm which is an intense moisturizer and I love it . This one has similar effects however it doesn’t leave that glossy look like honey balm.  But this does moisturize equally as well it’s just the gloss effect left from honey balm is not done with honey whip but I really love this . It also cleared my skin in two day’s from an allergic reaction I had with the number 7 day cream so it works for me I love it
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,I have very dry skin and this definitely does on do engh... it leaves my skin dry and dehydrated
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Philippines,honey whip,Smells great and goes in very smooth. Doesn’t feel oily or greasy at all. Can be used both day and night and pairs well with retinol and vitamin c. Would definitely purchase this again
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,BUY IT NOW.,OBSESSED WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!! Like wow. I have scrapped it clean and I need the largest bottle out there. An absolute staple. I have off and on dry skin depending on the weather and i found my skin smoother and hydrated all day long. BUY BUY BUY!
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Not so moisturizing,"This is a let down product. In spite of what it says about honey whip, when I apply it- it feels moisturizing but that moisturizing part dies down in couple of minutes. I don’t even that that dry skin but it feels dry and stretchy. I have to top it up with oil else I feel dry. Not what I expected."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Singapore,Best moisturizer,I’ve always been trying different moisturizer to do it’s job but I’ve never stuck to any because I really don’t like how they always leave a sticky feeling after. Decided to try this after reading all the positive reviews and THIS IS THE BEST. It does it’s job of moisturizing my face and does not leave a sticky feeling after. You have to try this. 
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Not enough moisture,"Beautiful packaging and wonderful texture. Very mild fragrance - not sure the negative comments on that - and leaves a natural finish which is practically impossible to find with everyone wanting to look like a greaseball - sorry, look dewy. Unfortunately not quite enough for my perimenopausal, combo leaning dry skin coming into winter in Minnesota as over the last couple weeks my skin feels tight and I can feel it pulling when I just move my eyes.  Perhaps adding the rose oil will help but I wouldn't know as when I ordered it, it said delivery for Wednesday. Then the next day it said delivery for Thursday ... ok, cutting it close as I'm headed even further north Thursday night but ok. It's now Thursday night and it says delivery for Friday. I have learned my lesson. No more orders from Sephora, in store only. Stupid samples (that you don't even actually get what you specifically picked) sucked me in even when I knew better. :("
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,amazing,I love this moisturizer. It absorbs well and not greasy .Love how this feels on my skin every morning. I notice my skins difference .
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,This would easily be a 5 if it did not smell like Pine Sol.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,New favorite!,Just fell in love with this moisturizer. My skin is very very sensitive and I also have dry skin during this time of the year. This product feels great and doesn’t leave a greasy feeling.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,So pleased!!,"I struggle to find creams that actually feel nice on my skin and this one took me by surprise! For reference I have dry skin which needs a lot of moisture yet doesn’t absorb creams well, so it’s hard to find something that works because gel creams don’t nearly cut it, and thicker creams sit on top, never absorbing. I also always have to use oil mixed with my cream to actually feel moisturized. This stuff absorbs super nicely and actually leaves my skin feeling nourished and soft, even without using any oils. Super happy I tried this and would recommend to anyone with a similar skin type. Hope this formula never changes or gets discontinued."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Best Ever !!,"Looove the texture very creamy and light, absorb well and smells good no heavy scents. Glowing skin without greasy or oily feeling or looking, definitely recommend to everyone."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,"I love fragrances in my skincare it makes the experience more enjoyable for me.. however, this moisturizer smells like LYSOL WIPES! It’s soooo bad, I had it on for a while but had to wipe it off bc the smell was making me gag. If they changed the scent or took it out I would use this again bc i think it would be a nice night time moisturizer, to heavy for day time IMO bc it’s heavy n thick but feels very hydrating. UGH I really wish this had a different scent! Huda if ur gonna keep adding fragrances to ur skincare/makeup plz make them waaaay more enjoyable and not smelling like Lysol wipes. Ugh. So disappointed rn!"
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,"I can see why some may like it, but it’s not for me. It disappeared on my skin too quickly, and I feel I need so much of it to get the job done. I am quite dry, and live in Canada, so winter is a struggle for my skin. To put it in perspective, I’m a “pharmacy honey halo” kind of girl- thick and lasting moisturizers are my wheelhouse, usually. If you’re looking for something that absorbs within minutes, you might like this. If you’re really dry, you might need something different."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Will definitely repurchase !,"Been using this product for over a week and I absolutely love it. With the weather getting colder, my skin has been getting dry. This moisturizes really well and doesn’t leave my face greasy at all. I find it to be very light weight and I love the subtle scent as well. I use on a morning and at night I apply it over the wishful rose oil for extra hydration. I will definitely repurchase"
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Australia,very good ,really nice cream with lovely faint scent. it's very moisturising and it's good as a base before foundation. I don't use primers so it's important for me that my moisturiser does it all and this one does. definitely recommend 
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,New Zealand,Best Moisturiser I Have Ever Owned ,"I can’t recommend this product highly enough. It does everything I wanted. The texture is the best, so light & creamy & the results on my skin are noticeable. My skin is looking the best it’s ever been. Will repurchase definitely. Highly recommend. "
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Luxurious moisturizer - my new favourite!,"I love the luxurious, velvety feel of this moisturizer! It absorbs well and has a lovely light honey scent! It has done wonders for the dry flaky skin on my forehead and I haven’t had any breakouts since using it for a month. Plus the packaging is beautiful. So glad I found this moisturizer!"
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Love the smell and texture,Love the smell of this moisturizer (honey + pineapple-ish) and the consistency is thick but goes on so smooth and evaporates quickly into skin. This is my new go to!
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Great Moisturizer for Combo Skin type,"Love this moisturizer! It hasn’t broken me out at all which is a big plus, because I’m very picky about my moisturizers. The texture is perfect, and it really keeps the skin hydrated - the only reason I took one star off is if you do apply too much at once it can cause problems for this with an oily t zone - overally a wonderful product that I’ll definitely be repurchasing. That won’t be for a while though because you really have to use the smallest amount which means the product lasts longer!"
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,PERFECT texture. No residue. Love it!,"I love this. I have dry skin. It is the perfect light texture and not greasy and not sticky. There is so residue left on after (you know how some gum/residue off then you rub your face?) This has no residue at all, as it absorbs into the skin. The smell is not strong at all like ome say... very light honey scent and fades instantly. I love it so much. I had a sample then bought the full one because it truly is wonderful. I like it used over the purple honey balm. If you have oiler skin you may only want this one as the balm is thick. Perfect and will always buy."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,good but not for me,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I tried sample, lasted few days. I really loved the texture and amount of hydration. Just right amount of weight and hydration, smoothe my skin instantly. However, fragrance is too strong and I can't stand the smell. I would not be able to use it. I wish they make it fragrance free."
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,Must try moisturizer,Great collagen and peptide moisturizer! Great texture! Absorbs in fully not greasy at all.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,So far so good…,I have been using this for a few days now and I like it a lot.  It does not give me the dewy look I wanted but it feels good on my skin and seems to work well too.  I wish they came up with an eye cream ☺️ too.
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,USA,amazing,I’m astonished. I have combination skin and this is amazing. Light weight but still hydrating!!! The yo glow scrub is my absolute favorite this is the best!!
WISHFUL-Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer,Canada,Wishful Honey Whip Peptide Moisturizer - 55g,"This product is it. Love it so much, it makes your skin feel really plump hydrated & fresh. It’s non sticky & just amazing. I’ve been using most of her wishful line since she’s started and I haven’t looked back since, the honey balm is just as great! Highly recommend."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Firming Night Cream,Australia,moisture moisture moisture:),i like this product as it is very moisturising and my skin just felt like it soaked it up however it does leaves a sticky residue on the skin so great for night time only... i did breakout the first night using it but afte a few nights my slin was fine 🙂  highly recommended and great price
DR. DENNIS GROSS-B3Adaptive Superfoods Barrier Repair Face Cream,Singapore,Smells weird and don't know what it does,I'm a big fan of Dr Dennis products but this was a huge miss for me. I do suffer from hormonal acne when I'm stressed but I don't feel like this product made any difference to my skin and I really dislike the coppery smell. I'd stick to other Dr Dennis moisturisers instead
DR. DENNIS GROSS-B3Adaptive Superfoods Barrier Repair Face Cream,Malaysia,great moisturiser,Been using it for few weeks. Since its thick i use it at night. It locks in the moisture the whole night. Not really ok with the smells but it do the job. Didnt break me out at all. Overall its a thick and rick moisturiser.

TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Singapore,hydrating,it is hydrating and light on the face. Nice one to slap on the face after bathing and you're just gonna lounge around at home. i haven't noticed anything groundbreaking after using this but I do like the lightness so I may repurchase after having fluttered around trying others. 
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Australia,MUA,"Tarte H2O moisturiser is cool when applied and super hydrating gel without leaving the skin feeling sticky or gritty, really beautiful to use after cleansing or under makep once dry. "

TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,Perfect moisturizer after a day of sunbathing,This is my go-to travel moisturizer! I love the gel like formula after a day of sunbathing on my travels. I don't use a serum when I travel so I love that my skin is getting everything it needs from this moisturizer. I use it at the end of the day when I'm going to bed after I washed my face.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Singapore,Drink of water indeed,This lightweight moisturiser is loved by my sensitive oily skin. my skin really drank it up and cause it is so lightweight there is a slight cooling sensation.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,tarte Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer - 15ml,"This product was ok. But something about it irritated my skin, if I put it on after a shower, it wound sting on my face. I am going back to Clinique Moisture Surge, better quality and it doesn’t sting my face."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Brunei,Ms,"By far, the best moisturizer. But it is always sold out and it's not always available at any stores/websites. So when there is one available, it's better to grab it than to regret it. Good job, Tarte!"
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Australia,love this ,"Love this moisturiser for daytime, nice and plumping. Soaks in quickly not greasy, maybe not the best for sensitive skin. 
Good over the rainforest of the sea serum. 

"
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,tarte Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer - 15ml,It left a tacky residue and my skin felt dry and tight after use.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Australia,Best choice in winter,My skin is really dry before I try this product
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,Good daytime moisturizer,"I received this in a subscription box and finally got around to using it up. I personally have dry skin so I lean more towards thinker moisturizers. however, I did enjoy using this in the mornings. I found it to be hydrating enough but also light, allowing me to layer sunscreen withough it being too heavy.The scent is okay but could be more suddle."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,Great Moisturizer,It made my skin feel so smooth and hydrated! I use this every morning after doing my whole routine and I love it so far. I received the sample size as a gift and I’m definitely gonna buy the larger size
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Singapore,Nope.,"I thought it would be great for my skin, but it was so-so. It was great when I received it in a sample format, but after purchasing a tub and when I started using regularly, I didn't feel as good. Sticky and oily."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Singapore,Suitable for oily skin,Love the cooling feel & smell after applying. The best moisturiser I have used so far for my very oily & sensitive skin. Will get the bigger size in my next purchase
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,Not for dry skin,"This product may only suffice for oily skin, as it's a light gel. But it's not hydrating enough for dry skin, and definitely NOT for winter. Furthermore, at its price point, it is also over priced and you'd get better products at this price even for other skin types.
I've found this brand super overhyped and a rip off to be honest- at least when it comes to skincare. This is just a gel that sits on top of my skin and doesn't even get absorbed. It does nothing for my skin either. I had to apply it twice at first, because I was wondering why I didn't get any hydration.
The smell is also not great- I get that it's the sea line, but I did not like the seaweed smell. Glad I bought the mini sized kit. Do not waste your money, especially if you have dry or even slightly dry skin. Too expensive, not effective and a waste of effort."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,HORRIBLE DRY CRAP,"So drying and sticky. Horrible product. Left my skin feeling even dryer. Rubbing my fingers over my skin 15 minutes after applying and I can literally hear how dry it is, sounds like sandpaper. This is like when you would put Elmer’s glue on your hand as a kid"
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,not hydrating,"Unfortunately, like other reviews have stated, this moisturizer is not hydrating at all. I have dry skin and my skin felt worse after putting this on. It’s cooling initially and feels nice but after a minute it disappeared and left a sticky residue. My skin felt very tight and uncomfortable. This would be a great moisturizer for the oiliest skin."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Malaysia,Ok moisturizer ,This is a non fragrance moisturizer. Very suitable for a sensitive skin. it helps to moisturize my skin but I guess it is not enough. It's not making any visible changes to my skin.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Malaysia,Gurl,"My second one. Pretty good for hydration but my skin is oily as well and it doesn't help in that department. Either way, good for daily use and didn't break out my skin. Fragrance is a little strong so beware. "
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Singapore,not what I thought ,"I love this brand, love the packaging and all their products have made me happy so far but this moisturiser feels very watery and I feel my skin dry. Not buying it again, good I got the small size that still is expensive for what it is. "
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,tarte Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer - 15ml,"Love this moisturizer, not too heavy and smells great. I love that it actually sinks instead of your skin instead of sitting on top."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Australia,Soak it up! ,My skin loved this! It easily absorbed and left my skin feeling hydrated without any residue. 
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,Expensive but worth it,I got this in a fabfitfun box and it’s the only face cream that I actually used all of the product from the boxes. I love using it every morning under my makeup or by itself
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,Not for dry climates,"Not for dry climates. No matter how much I use, I still have dry spots. Also the fragrance is unnecessary"

I rarely get acne on my cheeks.
Going to return."

TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,worth every penny,"At 57 I’ve found this is one of the best, most absorbent and hydrating moisturizers I’ve ever used. My skin literally drinks it up, no residue left behind. I can see a significant difference since I began using it 3 months ago. Great for sensitive skin like mine as well."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,Huge container for not very much product,"This is a nice gel-formula moisturizer. I have sensitive combination skin and I use this during the day under makeup and it doesn't make my skin feel oily or greasy, just well hydrated and fresh. The smell is pleasing. Can we just talk about the packaging for a second, though? What a waste of plastic. For the amount of product in this jar, the size is obscene. It wouldn't fit into my medicine cabinet, so I put all of it in a way smaller glass jar and it was crazy how much thick plastic just goes to waste. I knocked off a star because I really like the product, but I'd rather buy a different one that doesn't contribute to so much waste. C'mon Tarte!"
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,LOVE,I love the product. I got a sample size to try it out and I love it. I have been using it for a few months now am I am obsessed!
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,Tarte has good skincare oddly,"This moisturizer is very nice & cooling. It was hydrating & light during the summer, it wouldn’t be hydrating enough for the winter though. Impressed with Tarte overall as I looked at them as more of a makeup brand not skincare brand."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,"not for dry skin, burns",I bought this as I thought it would be good for dry skin. However with each daily application my skin would sting. I don't think gel creams (though I like the texture) work well for dry skin. I returned it.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Singapore,Very Moisturising,"Love the moisturiser, how moisturising it feels after its absorbed into the skin. A bit pricey, but some good stuff! Skin looks plump the next day. Love it!"
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Australia,the best,"I love this tarte moisturiser because it sets well and sits perfectly under my foundation. It never leaves my skin feeling oily. I highly recommend. The price is worth it.
"
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,It's for OILY SKIN people!,"I'm combination skin, not specifically super dry skin or anything. But this product is just not hydrating enough at all. Like, it's just a soothing gel but doesn't contain enough hydrating ingredients by any means. My skin dries up in few minutes after applying this, I doubt if there are many people loving this because you should have really oily skin to get on ok with just this moisturizer. Also it irritates my skin, I felt tingly sensation on my skin, which I'm not sure why it happened. Normally hyaluronic products doesn't have any of those sensation on my face, so I don't know why. Not repeating."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,love this product!,"Absolutely love this product! I once’s received this as a free mini size and I am hooked, the larger size is great and last pretty long!"
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,tarte Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer - 15ml,"It’s a refreshing gel with an overall pleasant fragrance.

TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Singapore,love it!,"got a small tub of sample from sephora, fall in love with it and bought the actual 50ml size. it's totally not oily, very hydrating and show immediate effect after a few days. you can see your face much more hydrated! I used to have peeling on my T zone and lower cheeks, have combi skin so can't use oil based moisturiser, this one really helps! it has a light minty scent and feels minty when applying."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,tarte Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer - 15ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really enjoyed this for daytime wear. It felt so light and full of moisture but then it literally evaporated in its container? I hadn’t used it for a few weeks and went to use some and it had evaporated because of the water base so I unfortunately won’t be purchasing again.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,tarte Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer - 15ml,I like the texture. Didn’t notice a fragrance that was too over powerful. But my oily skin literally felt dry like the desert and right about 30 min after I put it on  . I put on my normal moisturizer after this and threw this away.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,tarte Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer - 15ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It has a gel like texture and feels like you’re putting on a serum. But it’s heavily scented and my skin felt even more dry after I put it on. The packaging is cute but the product is not worth it. I’m glad I only got it as a sample.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,tarte Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer - 15ml,Good moisturizer! A little bit goes a long way. Doesn’t offer the moisture I prefer but overall it’s decent.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,New Zealand,LOVE THIS,I love this moisturiser so much!! It's super nice and light and leaves your skin feeling great without any sort of residue. Highly recommend.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Singapore,Perfect for humid climates,"Wow I love this moisturizer. I use it in the morning. It’s lightweight and has a smooth, gel like texture. The natural “scent” is wonderful. I hate fragrances in skincare products. It’s ideal for hot humid climates, but I wouldn’t suggest it for a nighttime moisturizer if you have very dry skin. I just really enjoy how simple this moisturizer feels. Wish it was a larger container tho!"
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,Love it!!!,I' m in love with this product! At first i got it as a sample and i felt in live with it! My skin is very difficult especially on skin care prosucts but this is perfect! Very light and you get a natural not oil finish! It does not make your skin more oily after hours of wearing!
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,tarte Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer - 15ml,Found this really light and refreshing. Suitable for my sensitive and acne prone skin. Received it as a free sample.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Australia,just okay,This moisturiser was just okay. Nothing special. You can definitely get better quality moisturisers for cheaper. The formula is very thin and is more of a light moisturiser. It’s nice for day time though 
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Malaysia,love it,Even in my 40s this gel moisturiser gives enough hydration for my skin. Wake up with skin looking fresh. Absorbs beautifully and a little goes a long way. Suitable for congested skin like mine
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,tarte Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer - 15ml,Amazing I would buy it anytime however it’s ridiculously priced.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,"Too sticky, doesn't sink in.","I wanted to love this (big fan of gel moisturizers layered with my skincare) but it was so sticky, I found it pretty confusing tbh. I enjoy tackiness with a gel primer, for example, but if I'm just trying to put on a moisturizer, I don't expect it to leave a straight up sticky layer on my skin that never seems to soak in. It just sits there like a residue, I couldn't stand it. Tried it a handful of times and ended up washing it off the last 3 times because I just could not get it to work for me. Bummer! I do think if you're a person with super oily skin and you want to skip primer before foundation, you could use this in place of a product like Milk Hydrogrip - it's truly that sticky."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,AMAZING MOISTURIZER,"I’m considered to have combination skin, but I do lean more towards oily from time to time. Then there are times where my skin wants to be dry. This moisturizer is amazing at giving my skin enough hydration! It’s one of the few moisturizers that I don’t find drying at all. You definitely only need a little bit when applying! It also gives a great healthy flowing effect without looking greasy. Some people don’t like the smelly bit I honestly love it. It smells very clean and professional to me. I highly recommend it since it does its job of keeping hydration for an extra boost"
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,BUY IT!,I love this stuff. Used to use for years - stopped and tried other products now im back on it. Nothing beats this for my sensitive rosacea!
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,Nice lightweight email,If you have combination/oily skin this will be great for you. I apply it as a base under my powder foundation and it sits so nicely on my skin and absorbs well. Pleasant scent too. Gave ti 4 stars because it isn't as hydrating as I'd like.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,it evaporates in the container.,"I opened it, used it for a week, closed it tightly and used something else for a month. When I opened it up to start using it again today it’s 90% empty?! I know how to close a container. I kept the protective top on it like I do all moisturizers. This is unacceptable. 
It was a fine moisturizer, nothing special but not bad. If you’re looking for a good gel, Belief is better and doesn’t do this nonsense. I can close that one for months and it doesn’t evaporate."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,tarte Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer - 15ml,I am 52 and I love this product.I got as a sample and I am ording more.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,tarte Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer - 15ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I usually prefer gel moisturizers and this one is nice and light.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,Other reviews are weird,"This moisturizes very well for my normal-oily skin. I like the texture and cool feel of the gel (big fan of gel-based formulas), it absorbs very easily and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. Some of these other reviews are SUPER confusing, I have had this product for months (since September, it is now March) and the product has NOT evaporated even a little bit. Someone said they need to use 4x as much product to get normal hydration? But I find that I need to use a pretty normal amount of product compared to other moisturizers I have used in the past. I use a dime or nickel sized amount dotted all over the face and this gets me the moisture I want. 

Now about the fragrance - this is my only gripe and why I marked it 3 stars. It does NOT smell like Vapor Rub as someone else pointed out (girl have you ever even smelled Vicks lol?) However it DOES have a very strong fragrance. I prefer fragrance-free products but I can deal with a light scent - this scent is NOT light. Very in-your-face floral smell. Why Tarte felt the need to make this formula so heavily scented is beyond me."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,My favourite moisturizer,I struggle with dry skin and peeling skin and when I use this my skin feels so light and fresh (its cooling some how when applied) and it has so much moisture. My face LOVES this!
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,tarte Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer - 15ml,I am more in favor of gel moisturizer especially in the day time and during hot weather. I have been using the Tatcha Water cream but found this one the similar texture and the same result. The price is cheaper.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,sticky & smelly,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love gel moisturizers but this was not it for me. It’s a bit sticky and doesn’t feel like it fully absorbs into my skin. I could probably have gotten past that but it is heavily scented and I don’t like putting scented products on my face. I got it as a sample and won’t be purchasing.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,My favorite moisturizer!,"This moisturizer is great wonderful! It is super light, glides smoothly onto the skin, and seeps into the skin. I use this all year-round. I have tried dozens of moisturizers, but always wanting to come back o this one."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,not worth it price-wise,"Feels fresh and light on your skin. BUT you need to put x4 times more the usual amount of any other moisturizer , PLUS, repeat it two or three times on your clean skin to reach to a moderate level of moisture on your skin.
 
Conclusion: it’s not worth it pricewise"
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,Best gel moisturizer right now!,A little goes a long way. I love this moisturizer. It’s better than Aqua bomb in my opinion. I will never use anything else. It’s super refreshing.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,Runny and icky,I wanted to love this product but for me it fell flat. I received this item as a free sample/offer with my purchase. Unfortunately this formula is not very moisturizing. I have dry skin and this product was not hydrating nor did it offer a glow. Also the consistency is runny and icky. I will never use this again.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,It's a no for me,"I love gel-moisturizers, which meant this had a chance. It's also formulated with hyaluronic acid, so I thought for sure it'd be like diving head first into a pool of hydration. I was wrong. This moisturizer is sticky, heavily fragranced, and no matter how much I applied, my skin felt tight, tacky, and dry. Overall, this is a no for me."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,really great for oily skin,"I loved this moisturizer. It makes your skin feel hydrated without feeling greasy, great consistency and seems to keep you supple all day. Only downside is it’s packaged in plastic."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,My favorite daytime moisturizer,Amazing daytime moisturizer!! It feels so refreshing and does not make my face oily at all. I love to use it every day in the mornings. I do not use it at night since I do prefer something more hydrating.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,Love it!,I just bought the other day and I'm in love. It made my face very smooth and soft.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,Not for me,"I'm one of those users who felt like it somehow dried up and I got less use of the product. After only a couple months, it looked like there was barely any left and I was in no way heave on the applications.

I did like how it moisturized my skin but honestly think its too much. Like, this would be good for people who are out in the sun all day or something."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,Doesn’t moisturize but absorbs/evaporates quickly,"Not a product I’d go out of my way to get again.  It’s something I would use when I need extremely little moisturizer.  So for someone with extreme oil this might be good but it’s not for me.   It reminds of me of using aloe on my face for sunburns as a kid, minus the stickiness.  It does absorb well but it’s just not hydrating enough.  My skin still feels totally dry after I put it on.  I don’t even need to try to massage it into my skin.  It gets absorbed immediately.  I don’t have dry skin. I have combination and my t-zone gets oily and forehead are more oily.   This still absorbed right away and I still needed to add more (thinking I just didn’t use enough product).  

It’s not terrible, just not right for me.  Probably better for the summer or super hot climates where the person has extremely oily skin."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,Love it: Hydrating not moisturizing!,I love this but I think I know why it’s getting mixed reviews.  I loved to AZ recently and my skin became incredibly dry.  I couldn’t fix it with moisturizes and finally figured out that the amount of oil on my skin was still adequate (hence better moisturizing wasn’t helping) but my skins hydration was poor.  One night w this and my skin was looking good again in the morning!  So I think it’s a hydration boost and may not be the right thing for people wanting to add more oil to their skin.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,Left my skin always feeling sticky,"The Texture is amazing, and it feels extremely hydrating. The only thing I don’t like about this product is when you rub it in your skin, your skin is left feeling sticky afterwards. For people with oily skin I do not recommend at all, maybe people with dry skin might not have the same feeling after applying it."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,tarte Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer - 15ml,"I received this moisturizer as a sample in a tarte kit. I use this after I've put on my tarte maracuja oil and let me tell you it has been my absolute favorite duo. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated, and I have combination skin with a t zone that tends to get dry. This moisturizer feels lightweight and there's no perfumes or artificial fragrances, which i personally prefer."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,tarte Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer - 15ml,"Wanted to love this product, but it is definitely a disappointment for me.  I really liked the texture and could get pass the smell, but it feels great for about five seconds and then like you are hitting your face with a dryer - only even better you are left with super dry, yet tacky feeling skin.  Very weird.  Will not purchase."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,Best moisturizer,"I love this moisturizer! I received it as a sample and I love it so much. I have combination skin with acne breakouts here and there so I’ve been on the lookout for a good moisturizer than won’t break me out and this moisturizer does the trick. It smells very nice and herbal and is a gel like consistency, it goes on very smoothly and hydrated my skin. It hasn’t broken me out and is not sticky at all I really enjoyed using this moisturizer,"
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,Cool Gel,"If you already like gel moisturizers, then there's really no reason for you to not like this one. Easy to apply, non-sticky, and leaves a smooth surface. It does do a decent job of moisturizing but the level of hydration it delivers doesn't last as long as some other gels I've tried - that's why I give it 4 out of 5."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,"Not groundbreaking, but still a great product","(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It’s not a holy grail product, but I do love it. It’s a gel moisturizer so doesn’t leave my face greasy, but it does leave it slightly sticky, but it’s honestly barely noticeable. I love the cooling sensation and the smell, but if you’re sensitive to scented products maybe stay away from this one. I’d say the only con to this is the slight stickiness, otherwise I love it."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,Great for acne prone skin,"I love this moisturizer! I feel like I've tried so many, and it's the only one that doesn't cause me to break out. It also works well under makeup."
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,Amazing,This product is sanding on my oily skin. It’s the only moisturizer that will keep my oils at bay.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,Canada,Amazing!!!,Love this product I use it right before bed and in the morning and it really locks in hydration and gives you this glowing look.
TARTE-Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer,USA,tarte Sea Drink Of H₂O Hydrating Boost Moisturizer - 15ml,"Light, absorbs quickly, doesn’t make my oily skin break out or feel gross by the end of the day. A little bit goes a long way, so the price is solid for how little I need each day."
SHISEIDO-Future Solution LX Total Regenerating Cream,USA,Shiseido Future Solution LX Total Regenerating Cream,"I love this cream, it is very thick with just a little bit you can use it all over my face and it also leaves my face well hydrated."
SHISEIDO-Future Solution LX Total Regenerating Cream,USA,Hydrating,Love this moisturizer! I bought it in a set. Its hydrating and really pnetrates into the skin. It is perfect for winter months!
SHISEIDO-Future Solution LX Total Regenerating Cream,USA,Shiseido Future Solution LX Total Regenerating Cream,Too heavy for my preference. Scent is too strong too. I only tried a sample size.
SHISEIDO-Future Solution LX Total Regenerating Cream,USA,Shiseido Future Solution LX Total Regenerating Cream,"I am so disappointed with Shiseido for changing the formula. the previous future solution was perfect. Light, hydrating, and didnt clog pores. This one is the total opposite. Not worth the money anymore... have to find another moisturizer"
SHISEIDO-Future Solution LX Total Regenerating Cream,USA,Not For Me,"I'm in my late 20s as an Asian girl who suffers from semi-dark circles. Decided to try this a little bit over a year ago. I love the packaging and how luxury it looks. Also comes with a stick and a tiny board for the cream and stick to on your night stand or makeup/skincare vanity area. I love how I don't have to dip my finger in if I decide to. The smell is great. Settle, no crazy smell to give me a headache/migraine. The texture is a thick cream but not crazy thick like Vasaline. I apply it at night and try to concentrate it under my eyes more. For someone who has combo skin (more oily in the Summer), I am disappointed. For the price I paid, I expected some improvements in my skin of long usage. Nothing has changed. Maybe because I'm still too young for it but it doesn't work for me. Plus it clogs my pores. Sadly, I will not be getting anymore of this unless I'm buying it as a gift for my mom, aunts or perhaps grandmother's age."
SHISEIDO-Future Solution LX Total Regenerating Cream,USA,Youth in a jar.,Tried and True. Delivers on its claims. Pricey but well wort the Dollar amount. Real results.
SHISEIDO-Future Solution LX Total Regenerating Cream,USA,Shiseido Future Solution LX Total Regenerating Cream,"I have used the Future Solution line for years and every time I try something different I end up returning to FS, despite the price.  My skin is noticeably different with it."
SHISEIDO-Future Solution LX Total Regenerating Cream,USA,Hydrates Well but Clogged Pores,"I used this cream for about 2 years. I immediately loved it and felt it was worth the very steep price. Its consistency and scent were luxurious and my skin was noticeably more hydrated. 

About the same time I noticed I was getting clogged facial pores. This product was the last thing I suspected given its price tag and results. After reading on Shiseido's website it was not non-comdogenic, I discontinued using it. The clogged pores stopped being an issue.

I realize not everyone will have this reaction. My skin was noticeably softer, but the clogged pore bumps were a deal breaker."
SHISEIDO-Future Solution LX Total Regenerating Cream,USA,"Loved it. Soft, silky and NON GREASY!!!!",I tried this in the store and actually ended up buying it because I loved it so much. It was so soft and creamy. Not greasy or watered down at all like some creams feel. I would definitely recommend it!
SHISEIDO-Future Solution LX Total Regenerating Cream,USA,Pure Magic!!!,"First ingredient of this night cream is angel tears. This cream is so heavenly!! It may seem pricey, but it lasted me almost a year! It's extremely moisturizing yet also very breathable. I've gotten compliments on radiant skin since using it, and have noticed fine lines between my brows and on my forehead disappear! This is absolutely worth every penny!!"
SHISEIDO-Future Solution LX Total Regenerating Cream,USA,Shiseido Future Solution LX Total Regenerating Cream,"Not sticky, very gentle soft great anti aging. I highly recommend this with the future solution balancing softner"

DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,meh,it's soothing and calming but not impressive. well... might be suitable for those who get sensitive skin. but it can't be too sensitive. the gel cream only helps with a mild level sensitive skin.

DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,HOLY GRAIL,"I've used so many of tubs of this elixir I have lost count! I use it when my skin is in its sensitive phase, or after a really, really long period under the sun, and when I want to be super basic with my skincare regime. A Sephora staff even shared with me how she healed her skin from splashes of burning oil on her face with this cream! So please ladies and gentlemen, this cream must be a staple in your skincare routine because it truly serves and delivers. "
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,Life Saver! ,"It’s my 5th time purchasing it. I don’t use it on a daily basis cause my skin need more moisture Pliny product. But when my skin is having some pimples/ slightly oily / redness, I will always come back to this! My all time life saver ! "

"
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,Totally worth buying,"Product was light but super hydrating for my super sensitive + combination oily skin, my chin area skin periodically will tends to peel (like I don’t even know why)
But after applying this gel every night for weeks, I seriously feel/see the differences
Sometimes during weekends I do apply in the morning but not before makeup as it’s kinda tacky
Overall product is worth buying/trying and the reviews from others online were all pleasant :)"
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,Great,Calming and yet not irriating and moisturizing
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,Holy Grail!! ,"A superb product, I've used it before as a gift, and fall in love with it and bought the biggest tub ever. Just a small amount of the product would function perfectly on my sensitive skin. Really recommended "
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,nice product,"Repurchase as this is good for me, love this product and like the texture it’s not oily and calm my sensitive skin. Dr jart product is really good, I love their serum too"
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,Ms.,It really helps to clam and soothe the skin. Redness reduced. Yet to see. Nice smell. Nice texture. One tube can last for very long time. Can use for moisturize your face or body. Fast delivery.  
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,soothing effects ,My first time trying this cream was last two years when Sephora used to give it as a birthday gift. Fall in love since then and keep using it till now. It’s give a soothing effect with fast absorption. My skin type is combination so I need a gel textured moisturiser.
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,Cica calming gel cream,"Love to use it when I have break outs or during the days when my skin are slightly more sensitive. I usually apply it before I go to bed and I can feel that it calms my skin, leaving my a sooth skin in the morning. "
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,Okay,I use this after a day out in the sun. It’s calming but I don’t see much changes on my face. Just reduce the redness. Not prone to acne. Soo. Okay la? Haha
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Philippines,Very good for the skin,I've been using this product since January 2021 and it's very good for the skin. It calmed my breakout and it has a subtle sensation due to the cicapair ingredient. It has calmed my sensitive skin. The only con I have would be a bit sticky when you first put it so be careful with the amount you put in your hand. Start with a pea size and gradually move from there
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,worked great for my skin,"I haven’t used these products before and this is the first I have tried. Initially I didn’t notice much change but after 2 weeks my skin is definitely less red. I actually put my gel cream in the refrigerator so it’s cool when applying. I just missed off half a star as it is a bit sticky and not amazing under makeup, but I need less make up now as my skin isn’t so red… so no major problem :)"
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,"Tried the kit I got for my birthday reward previous and I knew I had to get this one. It worked wondersss, definitely helped to calm the redness on my skin with my acne treatment. "
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,Favourite gel cream,"My favourite gel cream. Feels amazing on the face. Can replace toner; use it right after washing the face. However, it's a little pricey compared to other Korean skincare brands."
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,Ms,"I find this product not as effective as it is. It doesn’t really calm my skin a lot. The gel makes it very fast absorbent, and does not leave on oily. But overall, it’s a product I may not repurchase. "
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,good moisturiser but not for me ,this is a good gel moisturiser and doesn't cause any irritation. but I think it's not moisturising enough for my dry skin. it is still a good option if you have oily or combination skin.
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,Perfect for sensitive skin,"Skin gets super sensitive by wearing mask everyday. It soothes and calms my skin well. However, it is not moisture enough for dry skin. If your skin is oily and sensitive, go with it. "
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,good,Total in love with this product. definitely would repurchase this again. suitable for oily skin. would recommend this for those struggling with oily skin. 
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,So calming!,Amazing gel cream that is so calming and refreshing

DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,review,Got it as a sample previously and it worked super well in moisturing my skin which was super dry and peeling at that time. So bought the large tube this time round!
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,great for sensitive skin,"My sensitive, combination, acne prone skin loved it. Kept my skin nice and hydrated throughout the day. I would highly recommend it to anyone with similar skin type. "
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,Lived up the the name ,I used the trial cream post laser and it helped expedite healing greatly. My skin normally takes 3 weeks to recover from the laser treatment (still plenty of scabs at 3 weeks) but this cream actually worked its wonder in just 3-4 days of religious application. My skin was hydrated and the scabs dropped off within the 3-4 days. Hence bought this big tube for future use. 
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,calming for my boyfriend ,It works on my boyfriend skin and claiming down his acne. Recommended even for normal skin too. Love it. However not very moisture if you have dry skin 
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,Awesome Calming Gel! ,I tried the 15ml first before getting the 80ml. I absolutely love this gel cream. It vastly reduces the redness on face. I get regular facial so this gel cream does help. I like to apply generously on my face and neck.

DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,LOVE THIS!,"This is one of the product i will swear on my life on. I started using the sample version of it and was sold on it immediately. I use it for all types of pimples, the tiny bumps, the huge cystic pimples and the one with pus, and they have managed to get rid of it by soothing it down and not bursting it like other pimple creams. So you dont have to deal with acne scars after, it is heaven-sent to me as someone who is acne-prone. An investment!"
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,Ms,"At first it looks good and could feel the absorption on the skin very well. But after using it for day and night for about 2 weeks, skin starts to have many breakouts. "
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,Nice ,"I got this in small size product for free. 
I try this gel and surprisingly it’s suit with my skin. It soothes my acne and moisturize my face.   Cepat absorbs dalam kulit
"

DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,fantastic ,"Bought this after trying out the tester, definitely helps with my sensitive skin. It’s good to use after doing facial or treatment to calm the skin, about 5 mins after applying the skin is good and calm"
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,ANOTHER HOLY GRAIL,"I got the travel-sized version from my birthday month gift and I instantly fell in love with it! This is an amazing daily moisturiser for mornings  as it provides great hydration level without any heaviness, also it works great under foundation too! It gets absorbed into the skin pretty quickly so you won’t have to worry about any stickiness or tackiness."

I have oily sensitive skin that is prone to immediate reaction either from shaving, strong active ingredients and essential oils. I break this out when my skin needs immediate relief or calming.

I always apply it on blemishes, or random small bumps I get on my skin and it totally calms it down. Especially when I put it before I sleep.

My skin around the cheeks area easily get irritated after removing makeup. But I usually apply the whole face and this gel cream really calms my skin and does its job wonderfully. You girls should get one!
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,Best Moisturizer I’ve ever used,"This was a very good moisturizer for me compare to the cream version. This product does not sticky at all and it have a cooling effect like kiehls Ultra facial cream. This moisturizer also helps to calm my skin during I’m having my breakout. It did very well  to calm and hydrated my skin. The pros of this moisturizer are it contain 80% more of centella asiatica compare to the cream version. This ingredient help to repair and hydrate our skin barrier and save us from blemish skin. I would like to say this gel version moisturizer are more preferable to those have sensitive, acne , and oily skin people. For dry skin, you may try the cream version.  And also the price are acceptable "

DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,best but pricy ,One of the best moisturiser i’ve tried but downside is that it’s a bit pricy side. I love using gel type as it doens’t leave a oily finish after long hours of using it. And i found this one was the best as it kept my skin calm especially after derma-planning it was the best to be applied. 
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,average,"Works just like your average gel moisturiser, but with an expensive price tag. You can definitely get a different product that works the same at half the price. Bought it on sale, would only repurchase during sale again."
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,Fav moisturiser ,"I’ve tried so many moisturiser, but this one is the best one so far. It really does helps with the redness spots on my face. If I find that some part of my face feels like it needed treatment, I will only wear it as a treatment spot. For the price, its kinda pricey but you get what you paid for. 😁"
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,calming gel cream,"Bought this after trying the smaller version and im inlove! It really calms and sooth my redness. It takes quite awhile to dry but im fine with it. When it dries, my face feels smooth! I would repurchase again.. "

I love it and I'm using daily without fail. 
the best moisturiser. And I also purchase again  the recent Sephora offer . "
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,On my 4th tube!,"I have oily skin and at my early 30s. I love usinf this product because the formula is so simple and it never causes any problem to my skin whatsoever. I use my high end serum or ampoule before applying this gel cream to seal the moisture in. It's so much better than thousands of expensive branded moisturisers out there packed with glycerin. This product doesn't do magic, but it does what it's supposed to do-sooth and moisturises. Finishing my 4th tube and going to stock up again! "
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,superb,Tried this product few months ago when redeemed it on my purchase. Once tried I fall in love. Having fry and sensitive skin and It absorb very quickly into the skin and never leave any oily residue or any cakey layer on skin. And it makes my skin glows. That’s why purchased the bigger size. And it last long for the price. Worth the money. 
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,Soothing,"This gel moisturizer is ideal for calming redness and irritated skin. I use it for chaffing, razor burn, rashes, allergic reactions- it soothes and really calms the skin. It’s very lightweight but you don’t need much. One star off for Dr. Jart not being cruelty-free, I wish they would change their practices because I would continue to buy this if they did. "
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,repurchased ,Really good for sensitive/reactive/oily skin especially during the warm summer months. Sloths irritated skin and is absorbed pretty quick. I also prefer this squeeze tube packaging as compared to a jar because it’s more sanitary. 
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,witch hazel,"I was excited in the beginning cause it contains Cica - centella asitica which is great for sensitive skin, redness but then I noticed it also contains witch hazel can really severely irritate the skin :( I got really sad and stop purchasing again. It didn’t do much tho. "
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,Day time moisturiser ,"I really loved their spray mist and thought of giving this a go. However, I do not find this moisturising enough for my skin. This is best for day time moisturiser when you aim to apply more layers to your skin. "
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,my favourite ,i really love this moisturiser!! it's honestly so soothing for my skin that's always red and inflamed. the formula is so lightweight and literally feels like nothing on your skin once absorbed. i have recommended this to so many of my friends and they love it too :)  
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,bought it to treat my dry spots ,"At first ok lah. But need to continually use it on the dry spot coz if not, it’ll come back again. Now I’ve been using it as moisturiser for a month plus but didn’t see any benefits from it. So I will not repurchase. "
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,Love it ,"First of all I love this product because it’s in a tube. It’s way more hygienic than moisturizers in tubs. Secondly this product works well for my oily skin as it’s a gel and my makeup goes well on top of it as well. It’s also calming, whenever I use a strong retinol this moisturizer will calm my skin down. "
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,Niceee,"My refills. The moisturiser isnt thick or feels sticky when i sweat. Love, love, looooovvvveeeee this so much. I have redness around my cheeks and nose. Helps to cool down the redness and feels very light. The gel cream works better than i expected compared to other brands"
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,Worth buying product,"Have been using product for a month plus, not suitable to be applied daily as I’m having combination skin, my face will be extremely oily first few days when I used it every night. 
Then I alter my application for this product schedule to alternate days/ 2 days a week. 
Overall experience: product is worth getting but will be more suitable for people with dry skin, price wise is still affordable. "
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,average,The price point is very very decent but the effect of this moisturiser is very very average. Nothing bad and no side effects but nothing to scream about either.
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,Awesome Product,"I received the 15 ml sample together with the sheet mask as a birthday gift. I love it very much once I first used it. It really did what it claims, soothes and hydrates the skin. I’m having oily and sensitive skin. So far there is no break or bad reactions towards this products. I highly recommend this products to those who have sensitive skin."
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Philippines,2nd time buying very nice,This is my 2nd time ordering this I’ve already finished 1 tube. Very light and refreshing for oily skin. Good product for everyday use. It helped my skin generally 
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,Very Calming Indeed,"A good product to help soothe and irritation on skin. Very helpful if applied on irritated acnes. I’ve purchased this repeatly and will definitely buy again.
"
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,HG! ,I have oily acne prone skin that is quite sensitive. This works as a charm as a day moisturiser or as a treatment layer at night. It is not oily and helps skin recovery. Received two samples from sephora sized up to the full size as soon as I got the chance. 
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,I like the smell,Good moisturizer with herbal overtones. Dont really see the calming / healing effect on my skin over time though. Might be too sticky for some but works for me in the sg weather
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,Best moisturizer ever ,My personal best. Lucky to find this product. My skin tone and texture has greatly improved after a few weeks. Huge change. Skin so hydrated and fresh in the morning. Can ditch our make up. Highly recommended
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,Great for acne-prone and oily skin,"My skin can be pretty dry yet super oily at the same time, which kinda causes breakouts from time to time. But this product did its job! My skin is now moisturised and not oily, and definitely calms down the tiny kind of acne on my face. Been getting compliments that my face looks 'glowy'!"
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,Best Calming Cream That Actually Worked!,Tried this cream after a facial from a sample that I got from Sephora (we all already know the redness we get from extraction during a facial) and immediately this cream worked it’s magic and I could see my skin pretty calmed down to almost 0 redness so I immediately purchased the full size. Prolly one of the very few skincare that actually showed that it works. Will definitely repurchase forever.
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Singapore,SOOTHING ALTHOUGH I DONT REALLY LIKE THE SMELL,"It's good for soothing purposes after you applied your Vitamin A at night or after a chemical peel or when you have acne breakout. However, there is a slight gel smell that I dont fancy but cream texture is too strong for me."
DR.JART+-Cicapair Calming Gel Cream,Malaysia,Amazing Product,This is the second time I am purchasing this product. The first one last me for few months and a very great deal. It helps to reduce the redness on my skin and it calm my face. Love how the product feels on my face. Overall satisfied with this 💞
ESTÉE LAUDER-Revitalizing Supreme+ Night Intensive Restorative Crème,Australia,Overrated,"I used to love Estee Lauder but their range of skincare is absolutely overpriced and it does not do what it says it will. Lot's of promises but fails to deliver and has too much perfume in their range of skincare.
There is ""no"" cream that is a miracle fix for aging skin, and this is one of them.
There are far better-performing skincare products out there, and without the hefty price tag of Estee Lauder. Will not be purchasing anything from their range ever again. However, I will stock up on Ole Henriksen - his products are incredible and they do as the label says!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Revitalizing Supreme+ Night Intensive Restorative Crème,USA,Overly scented,"Used as a sample. This product has an overpowering perfume fragrance that I couldn’t get past. The feel was ok, but will not purchase due to its scent."

LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Leaves skin feeling silky smooth,"I received a small sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.

If you’re down to buy, you get what you buy in terms of luxury."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Just ok,I’ve been using this cream for a bit and honestly not worth the hype. I think there are much better creams on the market for the price.  It smells nice and I like the glass packaging. It’s okay but I would skip it

LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Water based,"Without hesitation I’ll say I’m sad that I didn’t get a bigger jar to sample because I actually liked this moisturizer. The packaging was the cutest with a little bag as well so I was excited. My skin absorbed this light weight moisturizer in a heart beat so if you like water based moisturizer this would work well. I did however compare it to my cetaphil which actually tingles on my face after using my glycolic acid face wash but the La mer actually didn’t irritate my skin at all. 

This la mer does have a small fragrant smell but it isn’t long lasting. This didn’t sit on top of my skin but it was still moisturizing. 

I’d definitely recommend this"

While many like this moisturizer, it just wasn’t for me.

I am so impressed with the quality and the luxurious feel. It feels so good on the skin as you apply it. It's cooling too.  It has a beautiful subtle smell I live for.

The price is a little over my budget, but a good product nonetheless"

It's great and all just not worth the price.
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,This is just “meh”,I have always been interested to try and hear about La Mer. I was extremely curious to try this out. I have oily and acne prone skin. This product is nothing special. It does the job and hydrates well but it didn’t make me impressed. It’s a nice cream if you want to just have it because you can. This product was a big “meh”.
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Beautiful Gel Cream,"I really enjoy a gel cream, and La Mer delivers luxury wise! A little bit of this product goes a long way.

LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer - 60ml,"This is a nice cream but it is so overrated. You are buying for the name brand basically. Also, the same ole they gave out was so small that you can’t tell whether it will work long term or not. On first impressions, this is a pass"

LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer - 60ml,"I'd like to note that I absolutely love the scent of the product, I just can't justify the price. A little goes a long way, but it is a super expensive product. Maybe if you'd like to have a luxe brand I'd suggest it."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,I like it,"I liked it. I have very dry skin. This worked very well for me. I use it in conjunction with oil. Oil first then La Mer cream. Both work best if you use it immediate after washing face, while it’s still damp. You only need a tiny bit, especially with the oil. It is dewy, isn’t that what us older women need? I got several months out of this tiny jar. Now I can not speak as to whether or not it’s better than another product of this price range. I figured at the price for a regular size jar, it must be good. I can say, no more dry flakes on my face. I am buying some PURE to see how it compares."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Good so far.,This is my first time officially using a La mer product. I like to use this item after removing my makeup and I want to remove puffiness from my face. It’s cool so far. I will still use it more times and review.
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,A repurchase for my mom,"My mom has been repurchasing this for herself for a couple of times now so this must say something, considering its price! For reference, her skin type is on the combination/oilier spectrum. "
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,I love this!,"I loveeeeeeee this moisturizer. I have oily and acne prone skin, and this moisturizer is simply amazing! I have been using this moisturizer for about 2-3 months, and lately, I have been getting so many compliments that my face looks so much clearer and even younger. Its definitely more hydrated (and I never previously liked moisturizers because I have oily skin and I felt like all moisturizers made me break out so I always avoided them). I bought the small one only to see if I’ll like it because it is a bit pricy, but with the results I am getting, it’s definitely worth it! The moisturizer not only smells amazing but also feels so refreshing! Definitely purchasing the large bottle next time! Also, a little goes a long way!"
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Canada,La Mer The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer - 60ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Do not buy or try if you are sensitive to scents! I was so excited to try this cream - I got a free sample. The smell is absolutely overwhelming. I have sensitive skin and I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone with allergies or sensitivities.
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Quite impressive!,"This stuff really works! It’s pricey but worth it. It makes my skin feel smooth and doesn’t lead to break outs. I love the scent, but why are you so expensive lol. I definitely recommend it , I use it as my everyday moisturizer and at night I use perricone which is a real good brand and not as pricey but great combo for great skin results."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,"Love La Mer, but this caused oily skin and acne.","At first, I laughed at the reviews of people claiming this made their skin breakout. However, after ~45 days of use (while I loved the texture, smell, and feeling of the cream after applying) my skin quickly became more oily and I began noticing acne like I was a teenager again. In the week or so since switching this out of my routine, that acne has disappeared. I love La Mer, but this product just doesn’t work with my skin."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Keep searching,"My mom loves this moisturizer and bought me one despite  telling her I didn’t want it because I do not like LA MER products. I’ve tried more than a few products and they’ve never failed to disappoint.

Not a fan of the smell, broke me out horribly, left my face feeling greasy. I have purchased several moisturizers in the past several months that are far superior for a bit less. 
Save your money lovelies, this just isn’t it. I promise."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,not worth the price,"still abit greasy for oily skin. and its pricy but worth trying. 
also have to criticize the live chat person as they dont answer your queries by checking with relevant department. instead they kept on asking you to wait for how many business days etc even though its obviously the system error. ended up when the days reached the points are still not credited. have to contact them again to add the points manually and was told that points have to be added separately for those with multipliers....their job is just to tour you around to see nothing. waste of time"
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,not worth the price,abit greasy for oily skin. rather overpriced
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,Lamer Cool Gel Cream,Fluffy soft texture with a cooling calming scent (kinda like mint) which is really suitable during hot weathers. However it doesn’t not really moisture much even for my combination skin(more towards to oily). I can understand it’s for oily skin as the consistency are much lighter and easier to absorb but I really couldn’t feel my skin being moisture. Will try to go for the soft and classic next time. 
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,La Mer moisturing cool gel cream,"Super in love with this moisturiser. great for combi/oily skin! not oily after application and most importantly, it smells so yums! totally my to go moisturiser, combined with the concentrate! super combi!!!"
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer - 60ml,I received a sample of the gel cream. I tend to have dry skin but I used during the humid summer weather. This gel cream did not moisturize at all. I have used other gel type creams from Belif and Aveeno and they worked well. This left my face feeling and looking dry and shortly after applying this I put on another moisturizer.  It has a powdery fragrance which I am not a fan of for face products. I would not purchase especially for what it costs.
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,Fav Moisturiser,"Been using this for past 2 years, it became my fav moisturiser. It’s very light but moisturising enough for my skin. Doesn’t cause breakout too. High price tag though 😅"
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,A little goes a long way!,"Helped to purchase for my mom and she loves it. Although it’s a really pricey product, only a tiny bit of product is required time — a little goes a long way!"
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,kinda disappointed,"I really liked this after the first use as it made my skin so soft and silky feeling, even after I woke up the next morning. I read a lot of reviews claiming it made them break out and I was like huh..interesting. Lo and behold, after 3 uses, I have a handful of massive zits in places I don’t normally get them. My skin has really been behaving too, and this is the only new product I’ve used within the last couple weeks."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,THE BEST,"My holy grail moisturizer! I absolutely love this stuff, the original is a little thick feeling for me but this one makes me feel refreshed, hydrated, and calms my sensitive skin right away!"
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,Little goes a long way,"This is the best face cream ! I’ve been using this for 
4 years and use it day and night. U just need a little amount and it will moisturise the whole face. It sits so perfect with any kind of primer, foundation, bb cream, sunscreen etc... It can be use for summer to winter. It doesn’t make your face oily but keeps it hydrated... my holy grail !!!"
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,Love the smell,"Love the smell of this moisturizer. The texture is light and it absorbed into the skin in no time. However, I need a larger amount in order to feel the moisturizing effect. Given the price range, I will not repurchase this again. Will try the soft cream or the original one instead."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Insane splurge but I have no regrets!,"I originally sampled this (thanks Sephora!) and never would have bought it otherwise because it’s so expensive to just try on a whim. Well, I guess that depends on your income bracket... this was definitely a splurge for me. The sample convinced me, and to treat myself to help cope with the pandemic, I bought the 1oz. I think I generally have pretty good skin which fortunately doesn’t require a whole lot of maintenance, and I do well with most nightcreams (my most recent go-to being the Andalou Cannacell Dreamy Night Cream, which costs significantly less than this and I had been happy with the results). I didn’t really think there was much room for improvement, but the results of the La Mer have been insane and I wake up with my skin feeling extra soft and smooth after adding this to my nighttime skincare routine. This is way too expensive to be a year-round thing for me, but I think it will be a nice once-a-year treat for my face."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,la mer gel cream ,"it is a much lighter consistency compared to the soft cream though still very moisturizing as you would expect from la mer products....perhaps this more suitable for people who wants a lighter texture? Or for oily skin. there's a slight difference in the ingredients for this compared to soft cream or the original cream. my mom loves this gel version more and swears by it. For me, since both are priced the same....I would rather get the soft cream for its richer texture, thus the 4 stars."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,cool product ❤️,"I have pretty much combinations skin throughout the year. Personally, I very much enjoy this Moisturising Cool Gel formula in skincare but I wanted to use it long enough in different weather conditions and daily environments, so I very much appreciate it😘 It smells just like other La Mer products very soothing. La Mer The Moisturizing Cool Gel Cream carries a lightweight creamy gel that doesn't feel too watery on my skin. Unlike the name, the gel cream doesn't have much of a 'cooling' feel than the fact that it's in a refreshing bouncy gel cream formula that may feel cool In other words. La Mer The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream almost feels 'second skin-like'  upon application, which I personally find 'cool' as it's basically 'no make?? It’s okay!! And make my skin fresh all day naturally ☺️"
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,luxury skincare for oily skin ,Overall a must try for those with oily skin as it’s cooling and soothing. I think la mer products just exert that premium quality but for the price tag some may consider other options. I love the smell and the trust that any day my skin needs a pick me up this will do the trick. 
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer - 60ml,"I wish this cream wasn’t so expensive because my skin loves it. I purchased it a few months ago when a large department store had a 25% sale on beauty products.
A little goes a long way and the gel texture glides on so effortlessly. My skin is combination/sensitive and acne prone, but this has not caused me to breakout. The smell is light and fresh. I highly recommend."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,"Calms, Cools and Moisturizes, My Go To in Summer","I love this creme.  Is goes on lighter than the La Mer moisturizing soft creme and regular creme.  I use this in the mornings during the summer when you need a lighter creme and use the moisturizing soft creme year round.  I also like to keep this gel creme in the refrigerator as is feels so good going on cool and calms your skin.  I have very sensitive skin and can't use many products, I haven't had any problems or break outs with this gel cream."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,la mer cool gel cream,The best moisturising cream. Worth the price. I have dry combination skin instead of oily skin. Yet this cool cream is able to keep my skin hydrated and smooth. The best part is able to help to minimise the redness around my skin.
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,Not Suitable for Sensitive Skin,"Skin type: Combination and sensitive. 

Pro: The product feels velvety, moisturizing and you can feel the cooling sensation immediately. The product is not light that you can layer other products beforehand. 

Cons: Product has a strong scent that is personally overwhelming and every time I use it I feel a slight burning sensation, but not enough to cause any redness. I've given it a try for a few weeks now and it's just not for me. It is probably more suitable if you don't have overly sensitive skin. "
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer - 60ml,"I have finished two jars already. The cooling sensation comforts the skin very well. I don't have serious skin concerns, so there's not so much improvement I can tell. But I’m addicted to its smell, which is nostalgic to me."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,best for Malaysian weather,I’ve tried all La Mer moisturisers and can say this is best for Malaysian weather whereas the rest tend to be extra rich and leave a slight grease behind in which I suppose are more for colder climate countries. There is no residue whatsoever after using the gel version and it’s almost like I’ve not put anything on. But yet my skin looks super hydrated. Definitely worth the money. Works extremely well for oily tzone areas. 
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,LOVE!,"I am in love with this product, it hydrates well, skin doesn’t feel dry and texture is not thick or sticky at all. Very comfortable on the skin, and has a soothing, cooling sensation. I love using this in the day time, especially if I will be outdoors. Makeup also seems to go on better after using it."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer - 60ml,"-caused breakout 
-my skin is combination and this cream was very oily on my skin
-causing stickiness on touch
-overpriced

If you really wish to have la mer and you have oily or combination skin I would suggest their gel cram moisturizer who didn’t give me breakout."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer - 60ml,"La Mer is a classic, iconic brand and you really feel like you’re spoiling yourself and the smell is wonderful. But it doesn’t justify the exorbitant price for me! I feel like it’s overpriced to the point it is to make it exclusive and bougie and I’m kind of uncomfortable with that messaging. Skincare should not be like that, it’s already expensive and confusing as it is, and I bought La Mer products before I started reading ingredient lists and understood how they/my skin work. Anyway, the ingredients are fairly basic, so a lot of other moisturizers contain them, and you can easily dupe this cream. You’re honestly just paying for the experience to use this exclusive magic cream."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,Mrs ,I have been using this moisturiser for a while now and I usually alternate between this and another one which I got from Aesop. This one is very light and moisturising at the same time. Will definitely repurchase. Thank you Sephora for finally stocking up la mer products. 
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer - 60ml,"the smell is absolutely pleasant and the texture is nicer compared to cream IMO, easier to apply. It does a pretty good job moisturizing my skin however it's not so much better compared to other $60-$90 creams."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Better than the cream,"I like this gel lotion so much more than the cream. I had to use the cream only at night because it was so thick and greasy! It was a good night cream, but I can't imagine people are wearing it during the day. It's far too greasy to put makeup over it, and I usually don't wear makeup to work, so my face just looked oily. This gel lotion is not oily at all, but it's definitely thick enough to be super hydrating and last all day! Plus, makeup goes on nicely over it."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Canada,Feels fantastic but...,"I really wanted to give this gel moisturizer a several star review, however, that is not honest.  I'm sure it works very well for some people other than me.  The silicone in this causes it and other oil free products containing silicone to pill on the face which makes it useless as a moisturizer unless you're planning on staying indoors sans sunscreen and makeup.  For those reasons I am providing a less than stellar review .  To the manufacturer, it's truly disappointing to realize that not only is your product ill suited to oily skin, you didn't do enough homework to ensure that the product wouldn't make acne worse.  For the price you're changing you ought to do better research to ensure your ingredients are truly helpful to those who are plagued with oily skin and acne."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Canada,Lighter for summer,"La Mer has quite the following and reputation!  I feel it is all well deserved.  Usually I use the original La Mer cream but do find that a bit heavy for the heat of summer so I thought I would try this as an alternative.  Glad i tried it.  It is moisturizing, non irritating and light for the heat and humidity.  Perfect for summer."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,amazing,I absolutely love this moisturizer...i hate that its so expensive but I do see why it is... im 50 and my skin looks like I'm 30....its because of this la mer cool cream.  my skin is combo/oily and I'm hooked ..
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Can’t live without,"I absolutely love this moisturizer. Best I’ve ever used, and I’ve tried every brand imaginable. It’s light, makes your skin soft, and has never made my acne prone skin breakout. I use this with the Treatment Lotion and actually get compliments on my skin now. Highly recommend!"
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Caused my first breakout?,"Got a trial size of this and was so excited because I love luxury beauty. 

Let me start by saying I NEVER, EVER breakout. So I read the breakout reviews and thought “bummer for people with acne prone skin”. I have never seen so much acne on my skin as I did after using this for a couple days. So disappointing but at least now I won’t ever be tempted to waste a huge wad of cash on it!"
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Love love love,I have oily skin and this is the best moisturizer for me. It really helps keep my oil down.
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Breakouts - do not recommend!,"This has caused the worst breakout in my entire life. I have over a dozen blemishes on my skin after using this for 10 days, and my doctor said the reaction could last for another 2 weeks. Definitely do not recommend."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,love it,Love this product. It is a bit pricey. But makes my skin feel amazing
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Acne Town!!?,"I received a sample of this and was excited because I love the foundation. I’m 42 combo in the T-zone and dry everywhere else , acne prone, sensitive skin and a avid,prescribed by my derm, tretin user for a few years now. Before first use  my face was blemish free. 3 days in of using this product I currently have 7  good sized acne bumps and a few small whiteheads in various places... it’s the high content of algae in this product that disrupts my skin. This  ingredient is high on the list of pore clogging ingredients ( it’s in the foundation as well but not second on the list, it’s relatively lower which would explain why I can use it with no break out issues) If your a person that has issues with pore clogging , white heads , acne caused by algae RUN FAR AWAY!! If not then it is actually a beautiful product!!!"
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Breakout city,"This stuff is trash. I got a sample out of curiosity, and it was so harsh and irritating. So many better options nowadays."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer - 60ml,"I almost didn’t want to try or fall in love with La Mer because of the price point. However, this has made a huge impact on my skin. I’ve been using it morning and night for about a week now. My skin is so hydrated and smooth with a visible difference in glow"
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Best product ever,"If you have never been to Neiman Marcus and have one of the La Mer beauty consultant showing you the CORRECT way to apply their products, you’ve been missing out! Most people have a negative opinion on La Mer products because they either over use it, or applied way more than recommended amount. I have just received this product as a sample, and I am so so in love with it! Leaves me skin super smooth yet not sticky. It dries up pretty quick. That’s because you’re supposed to use a “pea” size amount when applying this luxurious product.  I love it! Definitely would spend on the bigger size of this."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Canada,La Mer The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer - 60ml,"I have a ‘’combination’’ skin and this gel cream is really great for improving the overall health & look of my skin. However it does annoy me that it works so well because it’s really expensive, I understand it’s La Mer but i’m sure there are gel creams out there who can do the work for a third of the price. Also, there’s a smell to it, which does not annoy me but can annoy others."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,reformulated and now terrible,"When La Mer was bought out, this moisturizer was reformaluated and now does absolutely nothing. Not worth buying at all. Neutorgena hydro line is much better."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Magic gel that’s removed a facial scar,"I shared this with La Mer as well; they deserve full credit.  

I have a scar near the right corner of my upper lip, the result of an assault when I was 17.  I took a blow across the mouth that opened a gash right through the full thickness of my lip, and I’ve lived with it for over 40 years.

About two months ago, I picked up a jar of Gel de La Mer from Sephora (tyvm VIB Rouge!), and have been using it as directed every day.  Not only is my face smooth and hydrated, the scar is now softer, smoother, much lighter, and much less noticeable.  I’m happy to show before/after pics to give you an idea of the difference this product has made:  the pic of me in the gray sweater is from 12/11/2017, the one in the black fleece was taken 1/13/2020."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Skin Relief,"This stuff is expensive, but worth it! It comes with a little scoop so you’re not putting your finger inside. I’m not using this as my daily moisturizer, and a little goes a long way, so I expect to have this for a while. 

When I was trying out La Mer I expected my dry skin to respond most strongly to the regular cream, but the gel moisturizes my skin AND makes it feel better."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Canada,Not worth the price tag,"I got this as a gift and was extremely disappointed with the results that after 6 months of using it (once in the morning and once before bed - sometimes i skipped one, but at the very least once a day) I do not see any major results or changes to my skin. The biggest positive however, is that it did not react negatively to my skin. It did provide the moisture needed without being greasy or sticky and it sunk into my skin quite well. Didn't break me out, but really didn't do much either. A little goes a long way and I'm just now finishing the jar. Im just glad I didn't pay full price for this and cant imagine how I'd feel if I had and received these results... 

Another thing to mention if its worth mentioning is that i mixed this in the morning with my SPF and it mixed and sat on my skin very well!"
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,I can see why it’s $350,"Ok, I got a free trial size of this. I was so happy about it because I always wondered what $300 moisturizer feels like. Well, I’m impressed. I hate that I love it. I can’t shell out $350 for 2oz of moisturizer but I may just have to find a way!"
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer - 60ml,"I have sensitive skin and rosacea and I use this cream nightly to just sooth my skin and it’s great for that. I had a reaction to a face mask one night and my rosacea flared up and started burning, I applied this several times and the reaction went down almost immediately. I’m also acne prone and the gel version has never caused me to breakout. I don’t like the prices of the La Mer products or how strong their fragrance is, but it has been a lifesaver for me many times. I’d recommend trying it or getting samples first if you can just because of the price and everyone’s skin is unique."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Luxuriant,"I‘m a man with seb dermatitis and moderate acne; I’ve been looking for a luxury cream without the oil content that would flare up those conditions. This is certainly luxurious. It smells and feels amazing, and doesn’t seem to aggravate my seb derm or break me out. Skin certainly feels very smooth and hydrated throughout the day. A lot of skincare junkies will drag jar packaging, but from all the research I’ve done, the preservatives in the formula will more than protect against bacterial growth, and I bought extra spatulas online to avoid dunking my fingers.

It’s obviously very expensive, so I bought the large during the VIB sale to maximize value. I really like it, but once I get through this jar I may continue searching for something closer to the $100 range."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Instantly hydrates and cools,"Very soothing and hydrating. Beautiful texture that really is cooling and hydrates instantly. I love using this in the summer or when my skin is feeling red, flushed, or oily."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Canada,La Mer The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer - 60ml,Amazing product! Best cream to use if you have acne prone skin. Not heavy but still moisturizes!
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Sad,"I wanted so much that I liked and this product worked but it was not so, I do not doubt that hydrate but compared to “Murad water gel or Belif aqua bomb” that have worked great on my skin combined, a week of using them I see favorable changes  and they don't add oil to my skin and this one did.  Sadly it doesn't work for me :(  :("
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,La Mer The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer - 60ml,I really like this texture and it’s very hydrating. There is probably an equally good product out there though but if you have the money get this!
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,Canada,Don’t try this unless you want to be hooked,"I wish I could find a cheaper alternative, but despite trying many others (including as expensive) this is the best for my skin (combination). Light, smooth, non greasy, smells divine. Just perfect."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,BEST EVER!,"Out of all the face creams I have used throughout my life, this is by far my favorite and one that I can wear in the summer and the winter. My face looks flawless when I use this stuff! I'll be going back to this routine."
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,Love it!,"If you have oily/acne prone skin，you might wanna give it a try. I use it at night as a night time moisturizer, it really helps keep my skin hydrated while not being too oily. It does not break me out either. This is by far my favorite gel cream. Will repurchase!"
LA MER-The Moisturising Cool Gel Cream Moisturizer,USA,For true oily skin/ acne prone skin/combo skin!,"This is not for folks with normal skin that want a ""cooling effect"" in the summer! You will not get the results you expect.

This moisturizer is meant for acne prone or oily skin that can't take heavy product in warmer climate. 
With that being said, I'm one of the few that hated the original formula! It literally did nothing for me so I just used the original in the winter and skipped La Mer in warmer weather bc my skin couldn't take it. However, this new formula works wonders and, I can truly say, it feels like the lighter equivalent of the original! After just one use my skin is completely smooth, the few bumps I had disappeared, and my skin was so soft, I couldn't stop touching it, with the back of my hand of course! 
There is a technique to using all La Mer moisturizers and the little spoon it comes with will help ensure you don't use too much at once. I also only use as a night cream bc #1) you should be using a moisturizer with SPF in the day time and #2) you will get clogged skin if you use this under the sun!!"
DERMALOGICA-Barrier Repair Moisturizer,Canada,Highly recommend for skiing / ice-cold temperature,This might not be the intended use- but I use this product for skiing and other outdoor sports activities in the extreme cold. Keeps my face from becoming bright red and dry from days out in the snow.
DERMALOGICA-Barrier Repair Moisturizer,Canada,Amazing!!!!,"i love this product use it every morning and night! i have very sensitive skin and i go through very many ups and downs between a dry and normal skin type, but i find that the barrier cream always helps me."
DERMALOGICA-Barrier Repair Moisturizer,USA,"Hydrates, fills pores - primes for sensitive skin","This is long but, I have used it for a year.
I bought it to form a hydration barrier between my skin and make up because of my hyper-sensitive skin. I was thrilled to find it was an incredible primer and really hydrated. 
I have been using it for almost a year and find it works incredibly well with bb cream and light-med coverage foundation I use. 
I also use it under my eye and it makes my concealer not settle in my eye wrinkles/fine lines so much. 
Recently, I switched it out to use smashbox's green primer to help colour correct my rosacea - and suddenly my Bareminerals stick foundation was sticking in my pores, sheered out more, and generally looked kind of poor on my skin. :o 
So, I learned just home much a good primer matters. The smashbox is going back. I am happy paying the cost for this. A little goes a very long way and two tubes lasts me a whole year if I wear it every day - which it is safe to do."
DERMALOGICA-Barrier Repair Moisturizer,USA,Perfect for resurfaced skin,This product is amazing if you resurface your skin from time to time. It helps to provide that barrier from fresh new baby skin against the environmental factors. I use this every time my skin has been HEAVILY exfoliated. I definitely see the difference from using moisturizer vs this product. Actually gives your skin a chance to heal.
DERMALOGICA-Barrier Repair Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Barrier Repair Moisturizer,"I bought this after trying a sample.  It is a reasonable product, but I wish I had listened to the reviews....there are much cheaper products that do the same thing if not better.  This is REALLY pricey for what you get, which is basically a moderately decent primer.  Will not buy again."
DERMALOGICA-Barrier Repair Moisturizer,USA,Great as a primer and moisturizer !,"Love, love, love this product ! I use this as a moisturizer AND as a primer on my cheeks, where I have the most redness and on my nose. I adore the texture and feeling of this product and it makes my bumpy skin feel sooo smooth and soft. It also really feels like a ""barrier"" or a shield but its not heavy, it's actually really pleasant. 

Applying makeup on top of this is an absolute charm and foundation looks great and doesnt move at all. I find this product expensive, but since Im not buying primers anymore, I find its worth the money!"
DERMALOGICA-Barrier Repair Moisturizer,USA,"VERY soothing, silicone base","This is soooo soothing on my skin. My skin can get really red and inflamed in the winter (not rosacea though, so I cannot attest to that skin type), and this just brings everything right back down. Within an hour after use my skin tone is just so even and...calm. 
I have combo skin and wake up with wonderfully soft skin every morning after I use it; however, you might need a little extra moisture if you're super-dry.  Definitely recommend trying if you have sensitive skin - its a great calming moisturizer, you would just have to see if its moisturizing enough for you!

PSA: It does have a silicone base, so definitely avoid if you're not a fan of silicone products. It's basically a silicone mask of goodness - actually feels like a ""barrier"" on your skin."
DERMALOGICA-Barrier Repair Moisturizer,USA,amazing to lock in product,I use this after my moisturizer/face oils have dried. This sets everything into my skin and makes everything feel smooth and hydrated and protected
LANEIGE-Radian-C Cream,Singapore,great!,"i have oily combi skin and i swear i hate putting on moisturiser, cause it is usually heavy on my skin/sticky/oily. the consistency of this moisturiser is quite thick, but when it’s applied, it absorbs into the skin pretty quickly, not sticky and it gives the glowy/radiant look! 
but it’s a little too pricey! would repurchase if i’m feeling rich! haahah"
LANEIGE-Radian-C Cream,Singapore,laneige Radian C cream ,Oh I Love this product so much its not sticky on my Face Very light even though u apply at day time u dnt feel sticky.I have used 4 bottles Already.its worth the price not too expensive and not too cheap as well.I would difinetly recomend this product to my friends.
LANEIGE-Radian-C Cream,Singapore,new find,Have been using this cream for a while now and I love the texture. It is a cream but absorbs well into the skin and does not feel heavy. There is a slight fragrance to it but too overpowering 
LANEIGE-Radian-C Cream,Malaysia,Laneige Radian-C Cream ♥️,"Best for all skin types, but would work particularly well for those trying to treat dark spots and brighten up their overall complexion, while at the same time getting an added boost of moisture. If you're looking for bright skin that gives off a vibrant glow, you may have just found your new best friend in Laneige's Radian-C Cream ❤️"
LANEIGE-Radian-C Cream,Singapore,"Fine, a bit to the thicker side like sleeping mask",Have not seen the results yet. The scent and texture are ok for me. Bought it on a discount. Its like the sleeping mask texture. I do not have dark spots so not sure how it works on those problems.
LANEIGE-Radian-C Cream,Singapore,Laneige Radian C Cream,"This is good. Almost finished the bottle. Love the smell. I like my moisture with a little bit of fragrance. This is so refreshing with it fragrance not too strong. Good for sg weather too. 
"
LANEIGE-Radian-C Cream,Malaysia,ok,Maybe its not really suitable with my skin. Doesn’t really give me the radiant effect. Some people says its will make their faces breakout.. but for me it does nothing 
LANEIGE-Radian-C Cream,Malaysia,perfect,These moisturizes are really worth the dollar and it actually did brighten my complexion after using. It’s not sticky and glides well and somehow moisturizes long time.
LANEIGE-Radian-C Cream,Malaysia,My New Fav!,I love how it left my skin after applied and I dont even need to apply much. The moist stay quite long for me because I have a dry skin. So far it works well for me.
LANEIGE-Radian-C Cream,Singapore,RadiannC Cream,"Laneige Radian-C Cream, This item is 
good for sensitive skin like me, its works well on my sensitive skin and won’t cause breakout or any irritation on my skin and it also works good at balancing my dry skin"
LANEIGE-Radian-C Cream,Singapore,pretty good,Average product- would not buy again 
LANEIGE-Radian-C Cream,Singapore,loving it ,am using a lot of laneige products but feel it is the best everyday morning moisturiser . gives face a supple and fresh feeling has a light smell which is not very strong . happy using it daily 
LANEIGE-Radian-C Cream,Malaysia,"Lightweight, easily absorbed","Was looking for a lightweight day cream and this fits the bill for me. Has a light citrusy smell, easily absorbs into my combination skin, doesnt break me out, and I would like to think it does screen out blue UV light (haha). Onto my second jar."
LANEIGE-Radian-C Cream,Singapore,"nice smell , but not suitable for my skin","I have tired other Laineign product, but this CC cream is not suitable for my skin. a bit over moist. 
but the smell is good. I think it is good to use at winter time, not summer. "
LANEIGE-Radian-C Cream,Singapore,Lovely,"I love this product! This is vitamin brightening product, and also very hydrating like other laneige products. Soothing feeling is good and orange scent is great. Will definitely purchase again!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,add to your daily routine,"My boyfriend loves this product, He uses it every day. So light and perfect for summer without causing any irritation or clogged pores. Definitely recommend, have bought this product 5+ times"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,great as a skincare topper,I use this at the very end of my skincare routine and spray my face with water to increase the hydrophilic properties of the cream. Fantastic stuff but just careful around the eyes. 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Philippines,fav,"Favorite! Super light but hydrating at the same time. Glides easily, absorbs easily, not greasy, perfect. Got it on sale. My 3rd jar already. Will definitely repurchase. :) "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer - 20ml,"I’m addicted to this moisturizer. It’s light weight, great for summer and helps with my acne/hormonal breakouts. It’s gentle, and doesn’t  break me out. I have combination skin that runs on the dry side (in my 30s) so in the winter I’ve found it’s better as a day moisturizer and still trying to find something a touch heavier at night. But bottom line I use it once a day, every day every season! I only wish they’d make a bigger size- a container lasts me about 3 months max"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer - 20ml,I finished this quick. It’s good but it’s just another hyaluronic acid product. There are too much because it’s trendy but it does do the job for the moment!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Love this!,Love this moisturizer! A little really goes a long way and my skin drinks it right up. I love the light consistency of it and will continue to buy. My skin is on the oily side and it works well for me but I think if your skin is super dry this alone may not be enough.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Must have.,"Peter Thomas Roth never fails and always has great products. All of his products are amazing. I’ve been using this drench hyaluronic moisturizer since it’s came out. So gentle, non irritating, a great post facial procedure cream, perfect moisturizer for all seasons. I alternate with this and few other moisturizers"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,Water drench Hyaluronic acid moisturizer ,"Very light and lovely to use, works well under makeup as  a primer also. My skin gets very dry in winter so I need the help of other products also, definitely not moisturising enough for night time routine skin care, but, all in all I'm happy with this"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,New Zealand,Great for combination skin,"I love this moisturizer for my combination skin, very hydrating and it doesn't clog my pores"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,water drench is correct ,"This water drench moisturiser is the best of its kind. It's lightweight and absorbs completely leaving supple skin. I've repurchased time and time again. I always come back to it, my holy grail. "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,Bye dehydration!,"I wish I'd discovered this sooner! After testing many moisturisers, this is the first one that provides actual hydration and puts the water back in my skin. I can notice the difference as soon as I apply it. My skin is both dry and dehydrated, but I found that most other products only address dryness. I hope Sephora never stop selling this product. It also comes in a travel size which is handy when searching for new products."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Must-have,"I have been using this product for about 6 months now. I have very sensitive skin and typically get break outs from almost every moisturizer I've tried. PTR hyaluronic cloud cream not only hydrates my skin so well, but it has not caused any new breakouts, which is a bonus for me. Definitely my go-to moisturizer."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,omg this a weirdly great moisturiser,"This moisturiser is …what?! It’s definitely a cloud cream, it feels like a could. It starts feeling oily (it has no oil!) just feels like it, and once you apply it is absorbs into the skin so quickly and it leaves your skin super soft, hydrated and smooth. I really like it"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Favorite water moisturizer,Really good hydration without oiliness or breakouts
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer - 20ml,"Gentle and hydrating. If you have sensitive skin, i encourage you to try this. My go-to face cream!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Singapore,on behalf of a friend,Bought this on behalf of a friend and she loves this! She said her skin feels really nice and hydrated and she uses it as a daily moisturizer. Thanks Sephora
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Singapore,Awesome,I have gotten the mini size to try and it does help to control my combi skin. It is a creamy texture and does not leave a sticky feel on my face. It keeps my skin moisturised for quite long. I will repurchase again. 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,the best out there,My favorite moisturizer EVER. it's sooo lightweight and doesn't feel like you have anything on! It's perfect for sensitive skin and it's HYDRATES so much!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,New Zealand,mrs,This moisturiser is a must to have. It plumps your skin instantly. No oily feeling on the skin. Full of hydration. I would recommend to use. I used it for a week and literally saw a difference in the skin.Skin became more smooth and firm after one weeks use.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Singapore,ms,"Amazing for morning moisturising routine. This product is suitable for sensitive skin and the components are so consistent throughout the years. For humid countries, spread thinly will be adequate. In drier countries, will likely need to twice the amount to stay moisturised longer! "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer - 20ml,"My absolute favorite.  Got it as a sample, loved it so much more than any other moisturizer I’ve used so decided to buy it despite the high price point.  Have tried to find cheaper alternatives in the gel cream realm, but nothing else compares.  So gentle, so weightlessly moisturizing, no tacky finish, no oiliness, just delightful."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,New Zealand,Peter Thomas Roth products are a mixed bag,I love the pumpkin enzyme mask but I’ve tried a fair few Peter Thomas Roth products and most of them haven’t really wowed me. This moisturiser is ok but there are better ones out there for the same price or cheaper
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Philippines," Worth the price, smooth as silk","Absolutely my current favorite moisturizer. It feels amazing on my face, glides so smoothly, light as cloud and is not sticky at all. It feels like my no blur primer but feels so much lighter."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer - 20ml,LOVE this moisturizer! It makes my skin feel so nice and moisturized and refreshed as soon as I put it on in the morning
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,great product but smells weird,I tried this a while back and remembered that I loved it so I decided to buy the trial size duo. It came with this and another “night” cream. I fell in love all over again! So I decided to buy the full size… I like the product but the smell is so… weird. I can’t describe what it smells like. I wonder if I got a bad one out of the batch.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,moisture but light,"I was after a moisturiser that wasnt heavy but enough to notice softer skin, this is like gliding a thin veil of water over your face. its light but refreshes your skin."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,my fave,Been using this for a while and soo hydrating. Just wish it wasn’t soo expensive. I notice my face glows after using this for a while. Have tried others and keep coming back.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,Ms,"super hydrating, received as a gift. won't personally repurchase because of the price. however PTR makes some beautiful products. I'll let this one sit in my occassion splurge bucket for now!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Not moisturizing,"Glad I only had a sample of this one.  Not moisturizing at all, it goes in fast but right away my face felt tight.  Had to put on another moisturizer on top. Would not recommend at all for mature skin."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Grear hydartion under makeup,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!

Just a little goes a very long way!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,The BEST for combination skin,I absolutely love the way my skin feels afterwards!! Super hydrated and soft. Have to say I’m satisfied and happy with my purchase
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Singapore,Nice texture,"Texture of the gel glides on the skin. Does not have any oily sticky residue. Very suitable for SG climate. But might not be sufficient for very dry, aging skin. "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Singapore,Skin quencher ,Great for super dry and sensitive skin like mine. It’s cooling and calming for parched skin. Great for the first step for make-up prep. Also great as part of  skincare routine. Love Clinique! 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,ultra hydrating,This is a great light weight gel type moisturiser that is great for oily prone skin. I lather this on at night almost like a night mask and wake up with plump skin. It’s reasonably priced too which is a bonus 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer - 20ml,"I have normal to dry skin. Very clear, not prone to acne. All in all I’m happy with my skin. I loved this at first because it feels incredible and lightweight. But I went to my dermatologist who advised me to STOP using whatever new product I was using (which was this) as it was causing milia. So never again with this for me."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Milia prone ladies watch out,"So I just wanted to write this review for anyone who is prone to milia, steer clear. I wanted so badly to enjoy this cream because the texture was incredible and it hydrated the skin perfectly. 
But within a week my entire forehead was COVERED in milia. I cut this out of my routine and it went away within a week or so later."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer - 20ml,It’s good but not at all worth the price. Save your money there’s better ones out there
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,New Zealand,Super hydrating,This product is super Hydrating and absorbs so well into your skin. I've used this for under my eyes and really helps to plump them out. Really nice as I have sensitive skin and no reactions. Just soft hydrated skin. 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,New Fave,"Great, light-weight moisturizer. I am committed to the water drench with SPF for day, so I decided to try this at night. I really love this product. My skin felt plump and hydrated, but not over hydrated. My skin is extremely dry from fall through spring (I’m in New England) and I’m always in search of something that will hydrate with out being too thick and causing milia."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Nice Product,"I dislike heavy moisturizers . this one is light and hydrating. I use it every day x 6 months now.
it says it creates 72 hours of moisture which is a stretch but its a great product.
doesn't irritate my sensitive skin."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,Lovely,"First time purchasing so only bought the little one. I have trouble finding moisturisers that don't feel too heavy on my skin, especially in summer. This one is lovely and light, and leaves my skin feeling really soft and moisturised."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer - 20ml,Love this moisturizer. A little goes along way. Its a must try for those who have dry skin.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,stopped working after a month,"I liked this a lot at first but then it stopped working after about a month. Not sure why, but within minutes of application, my skin feels tight and dry as if I never applied any moisturizer."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer - 20ml,"A staple in my skin care regime.

It’s a very silky gel texture, and absorbs almost immediately, no residue or weirdness.  I use it morning and night, and always follow it up with a hydrating spritz to allow the hyaluronic acid to absorb and lock in even more moisture.  I feel like my skin drinks it up every time, and I love it.

Ever since I had my son, I went from a grubby oil slick, to extremely dry dry skin.  This has been my holy grail since discovering it.  That being said - it’s important to understand the job of this moisturizer…it’s to HYDRATE your skin.  By hydrating, it will help reduce to appearance of fine lines - but this is NOT a targeted treatment.  Many people complained it doing to this or that - but that’s because it’s not designed to do anything but hydrate your skin - which is does FABULOUSLY.  I’ve reccomended this to quite a few people, and they’ve all thanked me over and over for discovering it.

This is a super gentle formula, and would work wonders for literally any and all skin types.

Fun fact: Hyaluronic acid has the ability to absorb 1000x it’s weight in water!!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,gross smell,This stuff has a really terrible smell makes me not want to even use it because of it and I haven’t seen a significant difference in my dryness at all
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer - 20ml,"Easy gel based moisturizer. I enjoy, especially when my skin is sensitized. Have had no break out, pilling under make up, or any issues noted by others. I order the mini jar because the price and it lasts for a while."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,It feels fresh,I have try a lot of moisturizer but so far this is the best one I love it
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Singapore,love it,Totally love it! It’s so smooth and soft. Makes my skin so soft and moist. Will recommend it for those with dry skin. This is my go to moisturizer now. Purchase twice alrdy.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Singapore,okay,I had high hopes for this product but it wasn’t for me. I have combination skin and I felt this didn’t give me the moisture I needed. Perhaps on other skin types it would be better 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Love It ❤️,"This is literally the only hyaluronic acid that has ever worked for my dry skin. No irritation, even on and under my eyes. A true revelation for dry, super sensitive skin."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Only OK on my skin,"I got this as a 100 point award to try it first.  It does cause a bit of irritation on my lips, which is a sensitive area for me.  Otherwise it feels lovely and is moisturizing, but I actually prefer the Neutrogena Hydro Boost."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Can’t live without it,Couldn’t love this more! I have sensitive skin & avoided moisturized because they felt too heavy or made me break out. Not this one! 10/10!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,great for oily skin,"I have purchased this moisturizer probably about five times now. It’s great for my oily skin, doesn’t leave me shiny as others do after this ny skin feels hydrated."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,love it!,Love how hydrating this makes my skin feel. I have dry skin and it really helped to remove her dry skin. It is expensive but I think it is totally worth the price. I would definitely purchase this again.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,Lovely moisturiser,"I bought this moisturiser after trying (and unexpectedly loving) a sample. It feels quite different to other face moisturisers in that it it’s a bit like a light oil when applied, and soaks in so well leaving no sticky or oily residue behind. Most importantly it’s incredibly hydrating on my dry skin, very quickly getting rid of dry spots. "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer - 20ml,I love the feel of this moisturizer! Leaves my skin feeling so soft
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,not recommend,"This product did not do anything. I pretty much finishing the product but I didn’t like it. I used morning and night this product. But not worth to buy. 
Not worth to buy."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer - 20ml,"Good but not my favorite. The gel-like formula needs to be worked into my skin, so a longer application, really massaging it in (admittedly that feels very luxurious). It’s very hydrating, but I felt better after putting in a heavier moisturizing agent it oil on after. That felt like it kept the hydration in and my skin was fed for longer.

I would be even less satisfied if I paid full price, but I got it half price during a Black Friday sale, so to me it’s worth the price I paid. After I’m done with it, I will return to a creamier formula, not the water/hyaluronic acid style."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,disappointed,"I believe skin care is the best foundation you can have. I’m 61 and bought this set on sale. I have normal skin but after menopause lost my glow. This product smells like cardboard, doesn’t blend in well and definitely does not leave my skin moisturized or hydrated. I also drink plenty of water for hydration. I’m very disappointed in this product. It’s expensive and does absolutely nothing for my face."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,PTR water drench ,"This feels so so good on the skin! I apply is after I’ve washed my face or showered whilst my skin is still moist. My partner hates using moisturiser or anything else on his skin, but he actually loves using this, as it’s so easy to slather on "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Highly Recommend!,This is the best moisturizer I’ve ever used! Makes my skin feel moist and soft without feeling oily. Love it!!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Amazing!,I got this as a sample and I love it! I have oily/ acne prone skin and this doesn't break me out at all. In fact my skin has improved and I love the glow it gives me. I apply at night and wake up with plump & glowy skin!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,"Luxurious, refreshing, lightweight, worth it!","Like a few others here, I came to try this as a step up from the Garnier brand gel moisturizer and I am very happy with it. It's hydrating, yet lightweight. It's more expensive, but because you have to use so little of it, I feel it's worth it. It also has this wonderful melting effect as it's warmed by my skin that is so luxurious~"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Malaysia,my favorite moisturizer ever,No fragrance or odd smell which is good for sensitive and dehydrated skin like mine. Just wish it comes with spatula to avoid contamination from scooping the cream using fingers. Pls do not reformulate or discontinue this heavenly moisturizer
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer - 20ml,Love the way it makes my skin feel.  Very soothing l.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,the best ,Wow !! this has to be one of the best moisturisers I’ve ever tried !! Talk about hydration !! It delivers when it says it feels like a cloud and  it really does ! putting this on always feels amazing and I close my eyes and sigh !!! My 47 year old skin loves it !! gives me everything I need for supple and soft skin ! Def will continue using this gem !! it’s up there with the best ! It might be pricey but it’s worth every penny !!! Start saving !! 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Not worth the price,"Wanted to love this, hoping for a light-weight water cream but it fell short. Doesn't seem to keep your face hydrated."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,My fave moisturiser,"This stuff is the bomb, it's not oily, it feels lovely and cool on your skin and you can apply make up within a few minutes. "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,I love this moisturizer,This is now the second time I've ordered this moisturizer and I love it. A little bit goes a long way and I like that it feels like you just splashed water on your face and your face doesn't end up feeling like you have anything on and it's not remotely oily on my skin.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,"A substantial moisturizer, worth the splurge","I received a sample and definitely want to purchase the full size. Most gel-based, hyaluronic acid  type moisturizers are not heavy enough for my skin. But this one was thicker and denser, which I liked. It layered well over serums and under SPF. Having a moisturizer that does not pill under SPF seems harder and harder to find these days."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Like a cloud…,I do really like this. It leaves the skin feeling very hydrated without feeling greasy. I like to use this in the morning after washing my face and/or before makeup.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,love it,I really love this. Definitely moisturizing and feels nice on skin. It goes great under foundation!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Not a Fan,"I really wanted to like this product. I gave it a serious try. First off, I didn’t really like the watery consistency. It has the word “cream” in the description, but I found nothing creamy about it. But my biggest issue was that it causes my sling to break out—a lot. I haven’t had acne like this since I was a teenager, and no face product I’ve ever used has done this to me. When I stopped using it for a couple of days, my skin cleared right up. I used it again, and the next day I was broken out again. It pains me to throw this away, but it’s in the trash."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,one of the best,This moisturizer is a dreammm. So lightweight with a silky almost serum like texture. This is def a life saver in the winter. Also gives me a j-lo type glow ! It goes great alone and natural or under makeup.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,Great moisturizer,I received this moisturizer as a tester and was very pleasantly surprised. my skin was so soft and hydrated after the first use. only down side is it is a little costly. definitely worth the money though
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,love it,I initially received this product with all the facial masks. I had to get it again because it is amazing. During the winter I get one dry spot on my chin and since lately nothing. I would definitely buy it again.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,so light and soft ,"I loved this moisturizer, shame it’s so expensive as I would love to purchase again. Will wait for a sale. It’s like a gel, it soaks into your skin so nicely and isn’t greasy at all "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Not impressed.,"At first I thought I loved this stuff but after a few uses it didn’t impress me.  My makeup just kind of sat on my skin, even after priming.  Not worth the money."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer - 20ml,This stuff is amazing I use it every day and at night.. Peter Thomas Roth products really work and my skin glows
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,Wonderful,"There’s no wonder this product has “cloud” in its name. It literally feels like you’re dipping into the clouds when you use this! It’s so soft, light and smooth, it glides onto the skin so beautifully and is not oily or sticky at all. I feel so hydrated after using this. My new go to! "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Singapore,so-so for me,It didn’t work well for my sensitive combi skin.. it felt good on skin upon application but contribute to pimples popping; perhaps it’s better for dry skin or people working in harsh aircon environment.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Light! Silky! Not sticky!,"I am loving this!  Absorbs quickly without leaving a sticky residue, and then your skin is suddenly silky soft.  I wouldn't have even tried this except I somehow got a sample of the SPF version of this, which I'd also recommend if you use chemical sunscreens.  Totally worth the price!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Worth the price!,Noticeable difference within 1 week of daily use. Skin looks healthier and brighter. Not too greasy and absorbs quickly so putting makeup on after isn’t an issue. PTR is pricey but always worth it.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Malaysia,Perfect cream,"the texture was soft, feels like im touching the clouds.. anyway I have kinda oily type skin and its does moisten my face just the perfect amount and it also make my skin soft and smooth.. really recommended it eventho it kinda pricey "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,my most fav,"This is best ever moisturiser non greasy .superb formula absorbs very well.
Loved it .This is my all time favourite brand and product .

PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Dries out my skin,"How is it possible that this moisturizer actually dries my skin out? Must be the silicones in it. I am not impressed with this at all, and I am a skin care junkie. Will be returning."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Singapore,Gamer Changer,This has become my fav moisturiser to use day or night. It keeps my face hydrated esp at night with me waking up to a dewy skin. It gives my skin this shine minus the usual feeling of oil and sticky. 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Singapore,Great for sensitive skin,"Great moisturizer that hydrates without causing breakouts and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. Super light texture that absorbs almost immediately, perfect for humid climates"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,my favorite summer moisturizer ,"Bought a second one for back up already, good for oily skin in summer who doesn’t want the thick cream feeling before putting makeup. Bought my second one and will keep repurchasing. "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Finally found “The One”!,"This stuff is pretty incredible. I have been on a search for a great moisturizer for a while and I finally found the one. I always felt that other moisturizers made my skin feel moisturized while on, but as soon as I washed my face it felt dry and dull all over again. You can tell this moisturizer actually penetrates as my skin feels supple and glowing even after I wash my face. My skin has truly never looked better!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer - 20ml,My absolute new favorite! I use this everyday and my face has never felt and looked better ! I can not rave about this product enough. It is hands down the best moisturizer I have ever used and that’s saying a lot considering I have used much higher priced products and not gotten ever near the same results.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Super Hydrating,I loved this moisturizer! I would use at night and could still feel how hydrated my face felt when I woke up in the morning.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,worth the price!,Just bought a full size of this moisturizer. I have very dry skin and I have tried pretty much every big brand. There is no alternate to this . Highly recommend if you have dry skin
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,use multiple layers,Very watery. Needs multiple layers but does feel nice and smooth. Might go good with a thick serum or face oil. More like a base. Might be good in the summer or oily skin.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Malaysia,better than Tatcha the water cream,"Not cheap but it is Peter thomas roth. This brand is raved by cult and crowd alike, especially this moisturizer and I finally understand the hype. It literally feels like cloud (light upon touch and absorbed instantly). Sorry Tatcha but I feel this cream is much better in price, performance, and quality. Will purchase the full size once this 20ml pack size emptied."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Pamper your face with this great moisturizer,"❤️ it…it’s light, moisturizing, cooling and makes my face super soft upon waking up in the morning. I have the 5.1 oz,  and a year later, I’ve used only half of it."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,USA,Slimy and drying,"I got a sample and tried it this morning. My first reaction as I rubbed it in was ""this feels like lube."" Sure enough, there's dimethicone in the ingredients. Pretty high up, too. It feels really oily when it’s wet but it dries dry. Thirty minutes after applying, my face actually feels drier than before I applied."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Singapore,Best moisturizer,I have oily skin and this moisturizer is amazing! doesn't feel sticky nor oily. absorbs well and kept my skin moisturized! I can feel the difference after a few days of usage. the tub is a little small but well worth every cent I paid for it! 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,Love this! ,"Great moisturiser! Absorbs quickly, super light weight but hydrating! Goes under make up really will with no pilling. Smells fresh! Expensive but nice!!!! "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream Hydrating Moisturizer,Australia,excellent ,I normally use Neutrogena gel cream but this one is far better. I wake up with glowing hydrated skin. Perfect for combination skin types. Does not clog pores or feel oily. 
SHISEIDO-Vital Perfection Uplifting & Firming Cream Enriched,Malaysia,Malaysia,"I’m half way through my 1st jar and so far am
liking the texture of cream. As I have dry skin, the cream helps to moisturize and absorb fast without feeling of oiliness. Notice some firmness improvements. However for dark spots & frown lines probably need to continue with longer usage to see the effects. Will definitely repurchase!"
SHISEIDO-Vital Perfection Uplifting & Firming Cream Enriched,Singapore,my holy grail ,Have been using Shiseido for years and upgraded to the Vital Perfection range in my 40s. The moisturiser is creamy and blends well on my skin. It has a subtle smell. I love that I can use it for both day and night instead of having separate creams since I use a sunblock every day. It’s a worthy investment for mature dry skin.  
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Australia,in love ,"I love this product soo much it has helped with my face a lot. The moisturizer applies lightly, and I only need two small pumps to cover my face and my neck. It spreads easily and seems to melt into the skin, so makeup applies over it cleanly (and with no waiting period). My skin stayed evenly hydrated the entire day, never veering too dry or too oil"

CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Australia,good ,"Wow. Just wow. I’ve had Natasha Denona products before and have mostly been pleased. But this blew me away. Likely my most favourite from her so far. It is the most beautiful glow, it made my skin look like that of a poreless goddess. I’m quite pale but with yellow undertones. I got the light medium just because it looked prettiest from the swatches even though I would usually go for the lightest in these kinds of things, I’m very pleased I did."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Australia,Favorite Moisturizer ,The best moisturizer I have ever used. I’ll never use anything else. It’s great for my sensitive skin and it does not make me break. I have been using this for over two years and I can’t imagine not using it. I highly recommend.

CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Singapore,fuss free moisturizer ,I use the Gel version all the time and tried the lotion one as my skin got a little more dry. My skin definitely drinks up this moisturizer altho it leaves a sliiiiight grease feel after but nothing bad.
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Australia,Fabulous everyday moisturiser ,"Have been using this for years. This is the perfect, lightweight, under makeup but perfect SPF moisturizer. I have dry sensitive skin and this ticks all the boxes. I use it in conjunction with Sunday Riley and Drunk Elephant plus Sephora Eye Cream with Fantastic results. "

"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,New Zealand,love,Omg love Clinique skincare. It’s so soft and nice to put on. Doesn’t leave you feeling oily or yuck afterwards. Worth the money and def recommend to buy. Just check which type of skin you have to which one you would buy. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,New Zealand,Perfect,"After quite a long search I’ve finally found the one. This moisturiser is amazing for my sensitive skin, I especially love the lighter (but still extremely hydrating) lotion for the summer. Will definitely be repurchasing."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Australia,good night time moisturiser ,"Love this for after cleansing before bed, a little too oily to put on in the morning maybe because I live in a hotter climate, however, definitely recommend super moisturising!!!"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,my favourite ,"I think this is my 5th bottle, super hydrating, oil less, colourless, odourless, absorb quickly into skin and give out nice finishing. Satisfied and will recommend to my friends"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,Nice and simple,I always ordered the gel version n it’s my favourite. This time I accidentally ordered this lotion version n I’m glad this mistake happened because it’s more moisturizing thn the gel one n it didn’t break me out even tho I’ve oily combination skin. Just a decent simple moisturizer without any extra functions.
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Australia,it’s ok ,"Thave a sensitive combination dry skin and also currently

my acne started to pops out from my skin. My acne

CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,i love this,I love this moisturizer so much however to maintain useing this as i hv 3 sister its quite difficult as its quite expensive. But this is the best product that i have ever used plus with their cleanser too
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,it's a-OK product for me,"I have a sensitive combination dry skin and also currently is acne recovering. For the 1st week I used this product, my acne started to pops out from my skin. My acne wound becoming slower to recover. But this product really hydrated my skin.

CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,"thick texture, suitable for dry skin","bought this out of curiosity and also my usual day cream ran out. took some time to get use with the thick texture. use it as day cream under makeup and make sure it applied thoroughly due to its thick texture before sunscreen. do not overapply as skin can get too oily. too little, my dry skin felt tight/crack coz not enough moisture. it's buildable so apply as you needed. also great for travel as the bottle light & not easily spill. versatile can be use day or night. will repeat again!"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,Mrs,"I brought for my mom during September member sales 20%.
But this product price keep dropping. Feel so sad 😞.
texture was smooth, smell is okay. very moisture more suitable for night use especially sleeping in air-conditioned room. Big jug will consider repurchase only if have 40% discount or above.

CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Australia,BEST MOISTURISER ,"This product was magical on my skin.. It reduced my rashes and inflammation on skin.. Good hydration on my skin ... It felt soft after applying. Review based on One month usage...

"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,Moisturizing but heavy,"Keeps my face moisturized throughout the day. However, I found the texture to be quite heavy which causes my skin to look oily. A little amount is perfectly fine though."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,miss,This product is feels slighter heavier on the skin first upon application but nonetheless is good choice for people with dry skin. It’s a good base to use before spitting any makeup
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Australia,. ,Clinique brand is my favourite but i have a combination skin type since I started using this product i felt my face is breaking out so I decided to stop using it because it’s not suitable for my skin type but other wise it would make your face smooth and soft. you can use it as a primer before makeup it help the foundation set nicely
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,work wonders,Mom asked me to repurchase this again and again for her. She's soooooooooooooo in love w Clinique moisturiser. Smooth and works on her face she said . 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,New Zealand,great!,I have sensitive skin and often break out with heavy moisturisers but find this one by Clinique is great! Doesn’t leave my skin feeling gross and oily. Skin feels soft and hydrated after use! 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Singapore,Love this moisturiser,"Been using this for a while, bought for my mum and she lovesssss it. The product does its job and the pump makes it much more convenient as compared to moisture surge. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,New Zealand,wouldn’t recommend ,"Heard a lot of hype and good reviews on this product but unfortunately the product didn’t live up to it. I would rather buy the $10 simple moisturizer than this, it made no difference at all and left my skin feelings dry. For the price and claims it makes it’s just not worth it wouldn’t recommend."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,New Zealand,great product,"
Great for dry skin. has no scent and is good amount of product for the price so it's worth it. I would  definitely recommend to those with dryer skin."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Singapore,Worth it,My face is more moisturised after using this.  It is worth the price for me as 1 bottle of 125 mls can last me for at least 6 months.My skin is not so dry anymore and will recommend it. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,Superb,Pretty good in hydrating the skin! Smooth and light textured. High quality of moisturiser with affordable prize and large in size. Worth to try oit if you are having dry skin
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,Love it! ,"Light-weight hydrating moisturizer that leaves no sticky residue, keeping my face hydrated all day long. 😌 Also fragrance-free! A little goes a long way, one single pump is all you need."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Australia,My new skin care addiction 💜,"As my skin type is combination, which is mean if I need to decide use a skin care I'll go to many different products to feel satisfied to use one,
so, my skin love love love it!🥰"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,its moistures ,Well this is my 3rd or 4th purchased. Cheap and doing a very good job. Moisturizing. My skin is quite dry on certain area but this product have no problems to deal with it. Comes with large size bottle with pump..so it’ll last longer too. Use it twice a day after serum application.
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Australia,this product last for so long,I gave it almost five star because it honestly mad my skin like a baby but. It’s so good it makes the skin very moiste . Definitely recommend . Make sure you buy the cleanser with it
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,Day Moisturizing ,"This moisturiser doing the job so well, with affordable price anyone can have it and try for the small one 1st but u will never regret, I have a combination skins, this moisturiser does it job, I wear this after my serum and before put up my cc cream, I can feel my skin stay all day moisture. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,yay,"Total skincare staple for me. I typically get it without the pump - not anymore! Pump dispenses perfect amount of product and is so satisfying to push down. I have crazy sensitive eczema skin and I started using this when I had a bad flare around my eyes and neck. Most lotions burn and sting and do nothing for dryness - but this was one of those products that seemed to soothe, didn’t burn, and felt hydrating. It definitely leaves a tacky feel left over on the skin for awhile, but I don’t mind it. I like the sheen it gives my face too. Kinda like a dewy finish. I put it under my makeup and use it as a night cream as well. I’d say it’s not too heavy, not too light. Somewhere in the middle that I’m comfortable and pleased with. As someone with dry skin, this is the best. Not sure how it would work on oily or combo/problem area skin. Give it a shot"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,repeat order,It does its job. To moisture your skin. Applied at night and incredible skin at morning. Moist and plum my skin (combination skin). This is my second buy. It can stay last longer. Just use little pump for my face

CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,very rich ,Nice moisturizer without much fragrance. Bought this for my mum because they ran out of the ones with cartridge during the sales. Not disappointed at all. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Singapore,Just ok.,"Does a decent job of keeping my face moisturise during the day. My face do looks oily (not so greasy) throughout the day although I have super dry skin so I’m sure it comes from this moisturiser. So I don’t mind at all. I had to use 4 pumps every morning to apply it evenly to my face and neck. Don’t even know if it’s right. However, I do notice the plump in my face like it’s well hydrated. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,moisturized from am-pm!,my holygrail product! it’s the only product that i’ve tried so far that has made a huge difference for the dry patches on my face and has never caused any breakouts. i also love how a little amount goes a long way with this moisturizer!
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,The best ,"The formula that Clinique went with in this
 lotion is moisturizing, no doubt. If you have extremely dry skin that isn’t prone to being oily, then this moisturizer will most likely work perfectly for you. The moisturizing power of this lotion is absolutely insane, and it will ensure that your skin stays soft, supple, and moisturized literally all day."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,awesome 🥰,Superb. Love it. Easy on skin. Skin feels supple and hydrated. It also last very long.. Atleast 4 months. Love the convenient packaging. I love the fact it’s odourless. One of my favourites
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Australia,love love love ,"So happy with this purchase! I haven’t been able to find a moisturiser that suits my skin this well and I love that it’s lightweight and doesn’t feel too thick. I find that my face is so much better when I use it!
"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Australia,amazing everyday facial moisturiser,"Very hydrating lotion for my dry and flaky skin. It isn't too heavy as well, so I can wear it under my makeup. Would definitely recommend the product!"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,Malaysia,AMAZING,Its my third bottle already! The texture is quite thick which I prefer for my dry skin. My skin never crack and dehydrated since then. Its the only moisturiser that provide moist from am til pm! Love
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,great for my lizard skin,"this product treats my lizard skin with gentle care but strong enough to really soften my skin. a small amount goes a long way. recommend for dry skin, or combination."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,CLINIQUE   Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,This is my definitely my sweetheart! Been using this for years already and not planning to change to other. I have dry combination and this one had been keeping my skin all good. My skin is a Type 2 in Clinique.
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,Basic and nice,I have been using this for years. The product sits well on my skin and does not irritate it (I have sensitive skin). It moisturises well and does not clog up pores. Overall nice basic moisturiser.

CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,soft and supple skin,"I tried this product after religiously using oil of Olay for the past 20 years... since getting to my 40's I noticed my skin starting to dry out and my make up wasn't sitting well on my face anymore... after my first application this cream melted into my skin leaving it feeling refreshed, smooth and like it had just drank a tall glass of water (if that makes sense!...lol) now 3 months using this product (along with the Clinique facial soap and toner) my skin has never been better!"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,it’s aight,mm didn’t notice a dramatically difference when i use this. this product is very glowy tho which i don’t rly like cuz i have oily skin but it’s lightweight so i’m cool with it. just use some powder.
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,amazing ,Most lasting moisturiser! Doesn’t dry off fast leaving a shine on the skin all day long. Have been using this for the past 3-4 years now. Tried other moisturisers but by far my best! 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,amazing,This product has helped my dry skin so much i can not explain how happy i am with the result . I have been using this cream for over 2years now and i 100% reccomend this 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,perfect,This product works really well and moisturises the face perfectly. It allows the skin to feel smooth to the touch and helps in maintaining the skin. Would recommend to buy. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,not so drama ,This is just too moisturising and not suitable for my skin (semi oily skin). I ended up applied to my neck and get the one with gel instead of lotion. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,Returned,I was so disappointed with this cream! I thought that I would be super hydrating and just feel amazing on my skin. I have combo/dry skin and this just brought out so much texture around my nose and the beginning of pimples. Two days after I changed back to my normal cream it was fine. Very disappointed and took it back.
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,Moisturizing yet Oily ,"Product is Moisturizing yet oily at the end for a combination skin.  The smell of products like Dettol, not a decent fragrance like usual moisturizer. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,Holy grail,"My sixth bottle already. It’s a bit thick but it is not greasy at all. Suitable for the colder months. 

No fragrance, suitable for sensitive skin and acne prone skin like mine!! I tried the Cetaphil moisturiser and got a really bad reaction to it (itchy face, urticaria), so this is much better.

I just wish the packaging  is improved Bcs it’s really hard to get any product out when you hv like 15% left."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,My mum loves it ,My mum has been using this moisturizer for so many years and it's so good that she always come back for more. Great for those who has dry skin! This is a must have from Clinique guys. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,Good and not very expensive,"1 bottle can last me about 2-3 months for everyday use. One of my first Clinique products, this is my 3rd bottle! I have oily skin and this moisturiser can keep me hydrated all day."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,moiatirize,"works really well for me. i use it as a night moisturizer cause its really heavy thick consistency. when i wake up the next day, my skin feels supple and glowy! lasts for a few months too. good purchase."

CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,perfect daily moisturiser. ,Perfect moisturiser for daily wear. Would definitely purchase this moisturiser to wear everyday. Not too heavy but would suggest wearing an SPF on top as this moisturiser does not protect you from the sun. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,Great,"Packaging is good. All products are in perfect shape.
Good for dry skin. Very moisturizing and easy to use with as it comes with pump.Also more hygienic.
"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,good texture,I have used this for 2 years. I love this product because it is not really expensive. Keeps my skin hydrated and controls the oils on my skin. good texture. the price is worth buying.
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,LIFE CHANGING,I highly recommend this product for dry skin as your skin stays hydrated all day! You can feel the product on your face for hours. I don't use anything else 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,Good basic moisturiser ,"I have oily, sensitive and acne prone skin and this moisturiser does not irritate my skin at all. I like that my skin does not feel greasy after applying it and my skin absorbs it pretty quick. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,do not like it,I love Clinique product but this really disappointed me first of all is oily and smell very bad like chemical but I love the blue color want that one is better than this one no strange smell not oily nice to use it won’t feel weird like this one will not purchase again 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,My Holy Grail,I’ve been using this moisturiser for years. It’s the only moisturiser that combats my combination dry/oily skin and doesn’t leave me feeling heavy or greasy. I’d highly recommend this to any and everyone. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,memuaskan,sesuai dengan kulit saya yang sangat kering.pakai sikit sahaja sudah cukup.jimat dan satu botol boleh bertahan selama berapa bulan.mohon sephora masukkan toner no 1 untuk skin very dry.thanks
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,super,first i bought the travel size one and it was so amazing i just had to buy the 125ml one. it is super hydrating and it makes my skin feel great. its also very light.
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,recommended!,Bought this on private sale for my mom who has been using this moisturizer for over 20 years. She has dry skin and it moisturizes her face without leaving it oily. Very affordable considering how long one bottle can last!!
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,excellent ,"This product from Clinique done a Excellence performance! It make my skin moisturizer even in the air conditioning temperature! You don’t even have to used another moisturizer or lotion anymore after this step, because this product stored the water so well ! "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,ms,"i would say that i like it but to me the effect is very very minimal compared to other brands . with the cost that ive paid , im a bit dissapointed with it . generally it is a fine product"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,No dramatically difference,"It definitely makes no dramatically difference by using this lotion, it leaves a sticky layer after use but luckily it doesn't cause my skin to have any breakout."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,"You're not DRAMATICALLY different, but it does the job","I was expecting stellar results from this. I didn't. But it worked. I used to have normal-oily skin until I realized/was told that I have normal-dry skin so I started using this since other moisturizers proved to be too greasy for me and worsened my skin. This does just enough, just right, helped me to curb my congested pores that was causing bumps all over my face. They're like mini pimples that don't pop. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,Doesn't absorb well...,"To start off, I have dry to normal skin. This product actually leaves like this white cast (if you get what I'm trying to say) on the surface of my skin. Takes really long for me to massage it in. Wouldn't repurchase this again, though I might consider trying the gel one... Would recommend getting the smaller size to try first before committing (didn't do that and I'm totally regretting it)"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,works for oily skin too,"i heard so many good reviews about this moisturizer line and i decided to give it a try. initially, i didn't know that it's meant for oily skin so i was a little hesitant to try it when i got it but i did anyway and to my surprise...it moisturizes my oily skin very well! it didn't make my skin extra oily or anything so i guess it's good for oily skin too. the only thing i dislike is the smell - it's quite off putting ;("
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,Holy Grail,I have been using this moisturizer for years and I will always go back to it no matter what and it lasts a long time! It is quite thick but it does not cause my skin to be oily after a long day out and works wonders under make up as well!
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,can see difference,"I bought the trial pack, it did wonders to my combination skin. My make up stayed longer and less touch up needed. I bought the full size pack to make it a staple in my skin care routine.                            "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,it’s really different ,This is my go to product for moisturiser. Third time buying this. I also bought this for my sister and she really loves it. The skin feels hydrated and my face is so smooth every morning I wake up. It’s worth buying 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,Not as good as it seems,"This moisturizer is definitely good for sensitive skin. However, do not expect any dramatic effects as you will see none. 
After using 3 bottles, my skin still feels the same. At times, it does not even make your skin feel moisturized. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,great moisturizer ,Super love this lightweight moisturizer. It claims to be for dry skin to combination but it is not really oily like other facial cream. It absorbs well and didn’t leave any shine that are too visible on my face. A little dot is more than enough to cover the whole face and can last for more than half a year! Good product!
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+,,DRY SKIN,"It's extremely good for drying skin. Since it's lotion, it really helps for people with drying skin. A good collection for moisturizer. Moisturize my skin very well. The pump itself is a bonus. It's easier with the pump. Clinique is so good that it doesnt have any fragrance. So, it's very natural. Love it!"

I bought it full price but I can see now it’s half off and I definitely recommend grabbing it at this price. 
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,Singapore,aesop’s dupe ,it smells so herbal and it absorbs into the skin so fast. it is slightly water based which is something i am not usually a fan of but this is amazing. 
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,Singapore,Just OK,Don't see how it is 'ultra-light'. It is quite a heavy texture so I use it on my combination skin only when I am staying home.

PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,Singapore,great product!,This product is very lightweight & doesn’t leave a sticky feeling once it settles in. Can be used day or night as goes well under make up! The pump makes it very hygienic & easy to use but I’m not sure if all product can be retrieved when the moisturiser runs low.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,Australia,okay,"this moisturizer is pretty light-weight, thin and moisturizing. not the best moisturizer but not the worst anyway. i have a combination skin and this really works during a day-time. keeps my skin hydrated thru out the day but i’m not sure if this is super hydrating for a night cream but works too anyway. pretty worth it for $38 for plenty of product. and comes with a pump so keeps your hands off the product which is pretty convenient. "
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,Malaysia,Hydrated,"Everything is great. It does hydrate my skin, no more dry skin. I gave 4.5 because of the smell. Overall, good !

PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,Malaysia,🤩,I have been only using it for a week now but i does it’s job for me. I bought this for a moisturiser that is not too thick and also absorbs easily into my skin and yes it does exactly that. But it’s more for a day moisturiser since it’s really lightweight. As for night you might want a thicker moisturiser 
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,Malaysia,Works wonder,It is light and absorb fast into my skin. Plus it comes in a bottle that is hygienic. It did not cause me break out or any reaction after using it and Iwould totally recommend not just the moisturiser but also the brand. 
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,Malaysia,Light Weight Moisturiser,I like this moisturiser because it is value over money and i use after applying serum on my face. I have a really dry skin and this moisturiser works to keep the skin in balance.

PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,Make skin soft,"I have mature, sensitive skin that tends to be on the dry side, but is also prone to break-outs and rosacea. This moisturizer satisfies all those conditions. It's not too heavy (works great under make-up) but is not too light either (my skin feels nicely hydrated). and is non-irritating"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,Not bad,"I have oily dehydrated skin, this moisturiser did help to soften my skin but i don't think it was hydrating enough for me. Plus I prefer something with less fragrance. The price is okay for the amount but i would not repurchase."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,Its an okay moisturizer,I have really oily skin and I find this moisturizer lightweight and didn't make my skin extra oilier. it's pretty good under makeup too. The scent is okay with me and it didn't break me out. 
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,Ultra-Not-Light,The texture isn’t as light as I thought it would be? It felt a little greasy upon application. Definitely wouldn’t recommend for combination/oily skin. 
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,makes your skin glow!,"I have oily skin and had doubt on this cream based moisturiser at first. But it turned out to be great and absorbs really quickly into your skin. Applying this and massaging it over your face the night before, and immediately you get the natural glow on your face the next morning. No breakouts nor sensitive reactions on my acne prone skin."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,Quite a basic face cream,"The face cream is quite basic. ""Basic"" in the sense it doesn't do much. But it will last you months. I would recommend buying some other face cream if you want your cream to do more than just moisturise. Apart from that, it's relatively ""okay"" cream.​"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,okay moisturizer ,This goes well under make up. At first I was hesitant to use this cause of the reviews but. It worked fine on me. Will repurchase cause it’s a safe product that doesn’t break me out. 
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,Daily Moisturizer,Does the job of being a moisturizer for being cost-effective in the amount of product I get compared to many other brands which are more expensive for a third of the product. It felt a little heavy on the skin initially compared to other gel moisturizer but it does not bother me at all over time.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,decent moisturiser ,This is ideally a good day to day no fuss and straight forward moisturiser in my opinion. Im oily acne prone skin and this doesn’t give me any issue for daily use. 
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,Super Save!!,I've been used this about 4 months already and I still have half of the bottle.. This is super save!! and i like the way it monsturize my face.. only 2 pumps can put for the whole face.. 
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,light weight moisturiser ,"I love the texture. It would be absorbed very quickly into my skin. Even though it is light weight, it moisturise my skin really well, even when I was travelling to a colder climate. Love this product."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,New favourite! ,My favorite moisturizer for my face. It’s light and infused with vitamins. I knew I would love it since the purity one-step facial cleanser is the staple in my cabinet. It can be used in the morning or at night.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,not a good product,"it is light weight and not tacky. but frankly speaking, i feel like it doesn't do much in moisturizing the skin. i find the smell a little offensive and it made me breakout. i tried giving it to my husband since he liked the smell, but after days of using, he had pimples all over and his skin is not as sensitive as mine. not a good buy. "
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,must have,"I was looking for a really light, non oily moisturizer. I live in a very humid country so I fight oil daily. This is what i always use for easy days, like for everyday make up. It really is super light but still gives you the moisture your skin needs!"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,I like it,My skin absorbs this cream so fast and it doesn't oily and not dry at all. My skin feels fresh and flawless. I use it daily on morning and night. I liked it so much.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,good and reliable ,"I have normal and sensitive skin. My skincare routine at night is a little more intense so I wanted to have sometime gentler that I can use Everyday. This moisturiser smells good, does the job and doesn’t spoil my skin. And is affordable too. "
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,not bad,"it does what it says, providing 24-hr moisture. My skin feels more moisturized and glowy. Not sure about the pore minimizing though. 4 stars because the scent is too strong, it contains fragrance and alchohol so i won't repurchase. After all, the ingredients aren't as ""simple"" as it claims"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,Works well for my skin,Moisturizes my skin just enough. Not too oily. I use at least 3-4 pumps and it covers my whole face. Good price for the amount also. Not sure tho if it does anything more than moisturize.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,miss,"This product is simple to use and it’s very nourishing. I love the texture and smell of it too. On days when I’m lazy, I will just apply this straight to my dry skin without using any other serum or toner, and it still keeps my dry skin hydrated. Highly recommend dry skin ppl to try out!"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple Ultra-Light Moisturizer,,Holy grail potential,"As I put on this product, it didn't feel any different from the other moisturisers that I've used. it wasn't a high-end feel -- it didn't sink in immeditately, it wasn't as light weight as I expected it -- like I said, it seemed typical. But then, as time went on, I realized that this Philosophy Purity moisturiser hydrates my skin the entire day -- not very typical now, huh. Now, I understand why it's called ""Ultra lightweight"" -- it performs like a rich cream but it doesn't feel like one. It doesn't sink into the skin entirely, but I believe that's because it leaves a film on top to prevent moisture loss. Took one star off because unfortunately it breaks me out because of the shea butter."
SHISEIDO-Benefiance Wrinkle Smoothing Cream Enriched,Singapore,moms favourite ,Get this product for my mom and she loves it! Repeat purchase! She is very loyal to Shiseido and love all the products from them. She uses them since 20 years ago and still loving it!

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,USA,5 stars !!!!!,"i am SO GLAD the original firming sleeping cream is back in stock--i was so bummed thinking it was discontinued, as this is hands down the best night cream i've used, way better than the expensive brands! it feels a bit heavy while applying but to me, that means it's a good quality, rich sleeping cream--exactly as it's named as. and it does absorb well after some time. it also does firm the skin and hydrates nicely so you wake up with a soft, smooth face, even in the dry cold months. i never want to be without this cream! 5 stars, please don't ever discontinue this product!!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,Australia,So far so good!,"This overnight firming cream has quickly become part of my nightly skincare routine. Absorbs well and leaves skin feeling great. Physically, too soon to notice a difference but even just for how it makes your skin feel, definitely worth it"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,Australia,I love this night cream ,I love using this a few times a week when my skin is feeling like it needs some love. It’s a pretty thick cream but once it’s absorbed the skin is left feeling nourished and more firm. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,USA,Not bad,Not sure if this product makes a difference or not but you do get a lot for the price. It’s not as moisturizing as I’d like which is surprising because it’s thick to apply. Not bad
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,USA,Love love ❤️ love,I love this! Makes your face feel hydrated and soft when you wake up! Please don’t discontinue this ever!!!!!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,USA,Softer skin,"Good for the price, the AHAs do work as my skin is softer in the mornings. I also appreciate the reduced packaging."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,Australia,Ms ,"Waste of money, do nothing to the skin, neither moisturising nor hydrating.  The texture is odd , not smooth when you spread that out on your face.  I like Sephora home brand but this one is completely a disappointment! "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,USA,Sephora Collection Overnight Firming Cream,"Thick bouncy texture, which isn't bad once it's rubbed into the skin. However, made me break out after 1 week's use."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,Australia,not my fav ,This moisturiser is fine. It didn’t cause a reaction or clog pores but also doesn’t leave my skin feeling that nice. It’s very thick and feels a little greasy. Wouldn’t buy it again. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,USA,Sephora Collection Overnight Firming Cream,love this cream! leaves skin feeling so moisturized. the thick consistency was throwing me off at first but it works really well! feels very luxurious and leaves skin feeling so good

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,USA,Plumps and smooths out light wrinkles.,"I love how my skin looks in the morning, very plump. my only reason for leaving 4 stars is that once you apply don’t touch your face until it absorbs or it may pill on you."

Weird paste consistency and totally made me break out. Thick enough that I just traded it out to use as a foot cream but would never buy again"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,USA,Love It For Exfoliating My Dry 41-Yr-Old Skin,"This cream is simply AMAZING. I'd been hunting for an AHA overnight cream and I'm glad I hunted around Sephora brand for this one. My skin doesn't exfoliate naturally very well and I get dry bumps easily below my cheeks / above jawline. This stuff helps smooth my skin out. I also like the smell which reminds me of floral notes, but very natural. I actually bought a backup before the Rouge sale ended."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,USA,Sephora Collection Overnight Firming Cream,"This takes ""thick"" to a whole new level. It is not very creamy and you have to work a lot to get this to become soft and creamy enough to use. Once you do, this seems to work okay for my dry skin. My face felt soft the next morning. 

I will continue to use what I have but I probably won't be repurchasing in the future."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,USA,Sephora Collection Overnight Firming Cream,"This is an amazing cream! I just started using it a week but I feel like it leaves my skin nice, glowy, and plump in the morning when I wake up! It's kinda like a paste so you kinda need to get in there and get the product out. But this cream is worth it! It doesn't really smell like anything and I would say it's gentle on the skin as well!"

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,USA,Great night moisturizer!!,"Just finished my first jar of this face cream and I loved it! My face feels great and looks brightened when I wake up after using this cream. The consistency of this cream is rather thick so I would recommend warming it up with your hands really well before applying to the face. This works just as well or even better than the more expensive night creams I've used. I cannot comment on the firming aspects of it, but it works great as a normal night cream. Would definitely recommend!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,USA,Worth it,"Since using, my dry patches are almost gone, just a few more days. It feels divine on my face. Great cream to have!"

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,USA,thick and moisturizing,i love the way this feels when applied ! the consistency is similar to cream cheese (?) and is a bit hard to get out of the container. it blends into your skin so nicely leaving a moisturized appearance. my skin has been feeling soft after usage.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,Singapore,trying to fix my skin texture ,"This mask contains fruit acids so please do your own research before applying. I have hormonal acnes that cannot gone easily. I use this mask every other nights. When I use this, I tend to not putting anything else underneath.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,Canada,Sephora Collection Overnight Firming Cream,I love this night cream!! The AHA is exfoliating and it made my skin softer than any other product!! It has been helping even out my skin tone! It definitely is firming as well. It’s a very thick cream which I like for the PM. I’m not sure it’s super moisturizing but I don’t have dry skin so it works great for me. If you have super dry skin I’m not sure you’d find it super moisturizing because it is a firming cream. I will be buying this again when I run out!! Great size container of it too!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,New Zealand,mrs,After searching long times and reading reviews online at last I bought this cream last week. It has very smooth scent and very nourishing. Just start using night cream and this is very good in moisturising hope to see very good results in future. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,Canada,Sephora Collection Overnight Firming Cream,I really don't find this cream super hydrating. and it is super think the cream.(it feels like cream cheese I know it sounds weird. but just to give an idea an how the texture feels like.) if you want something that is hydrating go for something else. but if you want something that is not to expensive go for it.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,Canada,Affordable & effective!,I have been looking for an affordable and effective night cream that moisturizes my skin without making it feel too heavy or oily. This night cream is spectacular. It’s super moisturizing and rich and creamy and for a fraction of the cost (in comparison to other brands).
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Overnight Firming Cream,New Zealand,Great value for night cream,My skin feels super soft and supple when I apply this. When I wake up it feels hydrated and it’s not too greasy. I have combination dry skin and sits really well too and not heavy.
FRESH-Rose Hydrating Water Gel Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,Good,Have used this for many years and it used to be my go-to moisturizer. However it’s not as hydrating as I liked it to be. Hence I’ve changed out this moisturizer to provide my skin more moisture. 
FRESH-Rose Hydrating Water Gel Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,ok,mentioned many times that this brand doesn't work well on my skin so was disappointed that wasted my money to on it. consider trying out tester first before purchase 
FRESH-Rose Hydrating Water Gel Cream Moisturizer,Australia,nice one,"Very hydrating gel that makes the skin feel nice all day! If you have combination skin, a small drop of the gel will be sufficient. A very good product for winter use!"
FRESH-Rose Hydrating Water Gel Cream Moisturizer,Malaysia,Great for Oily skin,Already on my 4th bottle. My everyday moisturiser. Its really helps mattifying my oily skin. Use it for day time moisturiser as the gel type absorbs better. Not greasy to the touch. A bit pricey. 
FRESH-Rose Hydrating Water Gel Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,rose series,This texture of the rose gel cream is lighter than the rose cream. It’s good to use the gel cream before any make up or as a night cream. Basically rose series is good for sensitive skin.
FRESH-Rose Hydrating Water Gel Cream Moisturizer,Australia,Ok but prefer the cream,I normally use the face cream. however it was out of stock so I decided to try the gel cream. it is moisturising and it is great for summer. however personally I prefer the cream as I feel like it hydrates my skin better.
FRESH-Rose Hydrating Water Gel Cream Moisturizer,Australia,Great Moisturiser ,There’s nothing spectacular about this moisturiser. There’s nothing that stands out with it that makes me love it and jump to repurchase but it most definitely does it’s job. It works well with my combination oily skin. It’s nice and light. My skin likes it and absorbs it well. It leaves a nice subtle glow and I do think there a days I can see the benefit of the rose helping to calm a bit of my redness but I also think you can find the same or better at a cheaper price. I think honestly my skin and I like Glow Recipes watermelon moisturiser better but I have no complaints about this one. Actually maybe one. I think there isn’t a lot of product which is disappointing for the price. I feel like I emptied my bottle pretty quickly. But it’s a nice and trustworthy moisturiser for my skin
FRESH-Rose Hydrating Water Gel Cream Moisturizer,New Zealand,Pleasant surprise ,Love this! I have all the rose products and this is one of my favourites. 
FRESH-Rose Hydrating Water Gel Cream Moisturizer,New Zealand,review,"I like this Rose Hydrating Water Gel Cream Moisturizer. My skin is very dry especially in Winter, however, this Gel cream is very helpful and makes my skin so comfortable. Plus, this Gel is not too thick. I will buy it again. "
FRESH-Rose Hydrating Water Gel Cream Moisturizer,Singapore,love it,"I love all things from Fresh! Got this for day time use as a moisturizer since it is newly formulated in a thicker gel form. I stopped using a cream based moisturizer during the day as it is too humid wearing a mask. So far i am loving it, very hydrating but not thick and occlusive. Minus one star because of the hefty price tag.  "
KENZOKI-Youth Flow Skin Renew Velvet Cream,Singapore,review,Its very nice helps get rid of my wrinkles totally recommend it might buy again!! they also gave me a free moisturizer with it and it works really well and smells good! i use this with the moisturizer every night and it really helped me! :)

FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,Best morning moisturizer!,"I’ve bought this like 4 times, I love it as a morning moisturizer! The formula is light and soaks right into my skin, so the sunscreen goes atop really well. It always gives me an even and glowy tone. Love love love"
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,Mediocre At Best,Pretty good. Feels nice. STRONG orange citrus smell which I hate. You can’t smell it after you apply but it smells like a straight tangerine in your hands. Average. Don’t feel like it did much.
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Australia,nice,"It’s an okay moisturiser. I haven’t noticed much changes. Maybe I haven’t used it long enough. It’s moisturised and make your skin looks glowing. Give it a try
"
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Canada,Do not buy if your skin is even slightly oily!,After using this product I got very deep pimples and it also made my whiteheads worse. My face gets slightly oily during summer time but this product made my skin extremely oily. No clue why they says it’s good for combo skin; it is not!
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Australia,Everyday Moisturiser ,This is a great everyday moisturiser. It's light weight but moisturising and leaves a nice dewy glow.  Has worked well with my sensitive skin.
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Singapore,FRESH,My all time favourite! Is a must have daily just like my coffee. This is my 6th bottle still counting. My all time favourite! Is a must have daily just like my coffee. This is my 6th bottle still counting

FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Singapore,Fresh ,"This vitamin nectar glow cream smells really citrusy, when you apply it on your face you will see your face glowing and giving it the dewy-ness after you put on your foundation."
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Australia,vitamin nectar moisture glow face serum,The cream is quite thick and the smell is wonderful as usual “fresh” but i can’t say it did anything spectacular on me. I don’t think im going to buy it again but rather move on

FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,New Zealand,great face cream,"Very refreshing, makes my skin glow, is moisturising, a great product. Would definitely purchase again. Also has a great citrus scent. I recommend this product "
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,It’s okay-just not for Me,"I think my skin tends to look a bit dull so I tried this to see if I could get some life back lol (I look semi-dead most days). It was okay and it did make my skin look and feel nourished but after a few months of using it, my skin started to break out. My issue is that I cannot do creams- I know they tend to be too rich for me but tried this one anyway. I only dropped a star because of what it did to my skin but It Did work for a little while."
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Australia,Smells amazing,I could smell this cream all day!! This cream honestly smell amazing. So comforting at night. Hydrating all night long. Tick all the boxes!!! Cannot complain
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Singapore,Glow Moisturizer,"It gives a nice glow. However, it does not give enough moisture and it is a bit tingling. Perhaps because of the Vit C ingredient. "
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Singapore,don’t feel moisturizing ,"It’s an expensive face cream that does not feel moisturizing and it did not brighten my complexion. Has a mild citrusy scent. Don’t recommend it, will not buy it again"

The smell is mouth watering. Whenever I try different moisturizers I go back to this one simply for that smell. It’s a must have in your collection.
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Malaysia,Does not cause breakout at all !,"All of you have to take note, this Nectar Face Cream is super lovely and really works for me. I have an oily skin type and my skin is super sensitive to any face cream out there (you know the moisturiser will cause tiny breakouts). However, this Fresh Vitamin Nectar Face Cream does wonders ! My skin feels fresh after one using and very moist and feels even clearer ! Trust me. You should get this product in your shelf 😊"
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Taiwan,LC,"Light weight face cream, with a bit of gel like consistency. My skin feels hydrated and soft after use, the scent is also refreshing I think it’s perfect use for summer! "
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Singapore,not for me,can see the glow result after a week. but after a couple of weeks it made breakout on my face with scary bumps. stopped to using this glow serum and cream and seems the breakouts disappearing.
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,love love love,"I'm about to order my 3rd jar right now. I love the consistency of this product. It's almost like a hybrid of cream and gel. The smell is absolutely DIVINE. I know it's better to use products without any fragrance, but I will literally open the jar just to smell it when I'm in the bathroom. I have pretty dry sensitive skin and it has never caused a breakout. I will say that sometimes I need something a little thicker during the winter months or when my skin is extra dry, but I still really dig this moisturizer."
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN,NOT for sensitive skin. It burns my face and turns my skin red. Will probably keep and use as moisturizer for my arms and chest underneath my sunscreen. Thank goodness for their rose toner! Calms my skin immediately.

FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Singapore,unsure whether to repurchase,Bought this for my mil who has very dry skin and was looking for a product that can smooth out her skin and hydrate it at the same time.

FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Malaysia,smells exactly like orange ,"It’s a very moisturising, can’t apply too thick or too much on my t-zone as I have oily/combi skin, however it’s good to use as night cream on the side cheeks where it get drier after cleansing 
"

FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,New Zealand,fresh!! ,I Love this product it’s so fresh and gives a good amount of hydration without being overly heavy. Only a small amount needed too so it lasts for ages! Doesn’t make my makeup go greasy either even if I don’t put a primer on.

For now I’m exploring other moisturizers but looking forward to circle back to this one."

FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Singapore,Really Makes Skin Glow,I use this in the night when I sleep and this moisturizer really makes my skin glow the next day. Texture is nice as well. Would recommend to those who like a glowy shine on face.
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Australia,Misd,"Nice and fresh smell, smooth my skin 24hour long, still feels it when washing off. But it's not greasy! However giving me breakouts, not sure if it is the cream or my diet/sleep. In general Fresh products are always giving good experience."
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Australia,Great moisturiser,I love all FRESH products! It hydrates and energise my tired dull dry skin. Only scent is too strong which I am not like it
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Singapore,Perfect Choice!,"Fresh Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream - Feels so light & airy when applied, the fragrance is sweet & it definitely helps my face to grow beautiful"
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,Can't go without this product,I've been using this product for several years and I love it! I foolishly explored another option once and my skin was so bad Exxon could have fracked on my face. I switched back to this moisturizer and my skin was back to normal! I also use along my hairline because I do have some dandruff and it clears that up as well.
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Malaysia,fresh b,The smell of this product is so good and it doesn’t feel sticky when applied on face. It works really well and can see good results within days. Really love this product and def will repurchase again
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,It was ok...,It was ok. I used this product up until it ran empty. I have normal skin and saw no difference in my skin when using it. The product smelled nice but not a repurchase.
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,Glad I tried it!,"I was a little wary on this one after seeing some other reviews! I have dry skin that gets pretty dull looking, and is suuuper acne prone when introduced to the wrong ingredients. I can safely say this has not caused one breakout! The smell is a little unique, it kind of smells like Flinstones vitamins in my opinion, that orange vitamin C stuff you can mix in your water. Its not super strong though and doesn't linger so I don't mind it at all! I've been using this every morning and my skin is really smooth and bright!"
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,Great for my skin!,"I have acne-prone, combination skin, and it's really hard to find moisturizers for my skin type. Anti-acne stuff dries me out, gel moisturizers don't hydrate enough, or it's TOO hydrating and makes me break out. This stuff doesn't break me out and has actually noticeably improved my skin tone. It's the perfect amount of hydration, it doesn't dry me out but doesn't make me greasy either. If you're someone who has combo skin but are prone to breakouts, I'd give this a shot."
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,A pleasant way to start your day!,"I LOVE this moisturizer! I am a fresh fanatic because I love the ingredients they use and the smells. This one feels so relaxing because it smells like a sugared orange. Not too citrusy, very mellow and with a hint of sugar. Maybe one of those orange cream sickles? A little goes a long way. Not too thick, not too thin in viscosity. I have tried their youth one and I just think this one is way better to use in the morning because it's just such a pleasant smell to start your day with."
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,love it!!,"So glad I tired this moisturizer. Been using this for almost a month, and I totally see difference in my skin. My skin feels soft, glowing, hydrated."
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,Bad shipping experience,"I get it, I bought the cream not the paper case. But, seriously broken cap? Which I can not even close it if I open it. Really Disappointed ~"
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Malaysia,My to go brightening moisturiser,"With all the brightening ingredients, this is my 3rd bottle for skin brightening. It’s easier to get online compared to the stores which carries limited quantities on it. Like this together with their mask line. "
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Singapore,one of my favourites ,this is one of my favourite moisturisers. the formula is super light weight yet hydrating. i love to use this as my PM moisturiser and i will wake up with glowy soft skin the next morning. 
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Australia,Ms,"It’s my go to without fail. Face feels moisturised and well suited to my sometimes sensitive skin. Used together with my overnight mask and I wake up feeling good. 
"
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Singapore,face cream ,this cream was just ok for me. didn't do much. I didnt really like the smell of it though. I wouldn't repurchase cause it is very expensive for a 50ml bottle that I don't see any results from 
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Malaysia,i swear by it! ,"i started using this when i moved to ireland when my skin turned from normal to dry. this worked WONDERS and i've received so many compliments on my skin. it helped with my acne, dry skin & my skin is always so soft! love love love it. this is my 3rd jar :) i'm always recommending it to friends."
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Australia,gives you the glow,Incredibly moisturising and feels thick at first but sinks into the skin for a lightweight feel quickly. Leaves my skin feeling plump and hydrated. Have already received several complements on how glowy my skin looks lately and the only thing I have changed in my skincare routine is this. Will definitely be repurchasing
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Malaysia,Love the scent!,Bought this coz my rose moisturiser was out of stock. Really fell in love with the scent! The consistency is less thicker than the one in rose. But I still love it nonetheless!
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Australia,Mr,Very nice product for my skin type. It has pleasant nectar fragrance and make my skin glow~ It would be nicer if the moist could last for longer.
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Singapore,Love the Smell,I love how this product smells. Smells like heaven! It makes my skin to glow and looks brighter than before. Please avoid using this if you have active acnes. 
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Malaysia,a amazing ,"So light weight, fresh look, smells strong but overall good for any time of the day. Definitely a repurchase and to explore more of the brand’s products"
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Singapore,Combination Type,"The smell is strong and texture is abit heavy therefore i only use it at night or staying at home. But it does well in keeping my face hydrated. The glow is definitely there.
"
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,New Zealand,good moisturizer ,"Was good, enjoyed the refreshing smell and feel. I don’t think it gave any dramatic difference in good or bad way, but was okay moisturizer. 

However I won’t purchase again as I enjoyed the see
deep hydration face cream from fresh over this one. "
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Singapore,Best Moisturiser ,"I’m having combination skin and can get skin breakout easily. I’m really surprise that this product suits me so well. Normally, I apply the moisturiser after kombucha essence. I have already bought second bottle. "
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Singapore,Healthier looking complexion,"Dose of vitamins for the skin, it is a lightweight and revitalising moisturising cream. I have a oily acne prone skin, someday it seems to absorb well into the skin but someday it doesn't. Skin does glow on the following day. 

It has a light citrus scent that helps in mind relaxing too.. "
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Australia,Nice but not for me,This is a lovely product with a nice scent and beautiful texture. It definitely makes my skin look healthier and brighter but unfortunately also makes my T zone really really oily. I have combination skin which is prone to congestion and breakouts so this doesn’t work for me. I have switched to using it on my décolleté and shoulders so it doesn’t go to waste and it’s perfectly fine there.
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,New Zealand,not suitable for oily skin,"I have oily skin and don’t think it’s suitable for people who have oily skin like me. It’s too heavy to use as a day cream, it gives me pimples, but the hydration level is good. "
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Canada,Overwhelming Scent and Face Irritation,"I really wanted to love the products, but I didn’t even get past using up the cream on the protective lid before returning. The scent is overpowering, my skin looks irritated and blotchy.... disappointed because I love fresh’s other products"
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Singapore,Too heavy for a day cream,"Unless you have severely dry, cactus-like skin this will be too heavy for a day cream. I always feel like this sits on my skin and doesn't let it breath. Even in the house with aircon on, I sweat underneath it. I'm using it as a night cream now to finish the jar but even then, most of it ends up on my pillow. Disappointing 😞"
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Australia,Vitamin Nectar Moisture face cream,Vitamin Nectar moisturiser is a nice product. It is light weight and the skin stays hydrated all day. I am not sure about the glowing effect. i much prefer fresh rose range
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,nice,This moisturizer smells super good and left my face a little hydrated. Not good for winter but super great if you need a light moisturizer
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Australia,Beautiful ,"Beautiful cream with just the right level of moisturisation, sinks in and doesn’t leave a film. Lovely light fresh scent that doesn’t linger. Made my skin softer. I have combination skin and papular rosacea and it didn’t aggravate my skin or make me break out. This is a keeper in my beauty routine. "
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,Love it!,"This moisturizer was recommended by my facials girl. I have oily skin and she mentioned that my skin was very dull it looked dehydrated. I've been using vitamin nectar for about two months and I love how my skin looks. It looks fresh!
I always get hormonal acne on my chin but I double up with this product and i've noticed that I have not been breaking out like before."
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,really like this !!!,Very nice moisturizer! I have normal to dry skin and this works really well especially paired with my hyaluronic acid. It has a very fresh smell and feels really fresh on my skin. I like to use both a.m. and p.m. Especially at night I will apply to my whole face and wakeup with my skin look very dewy and plump. I want to try all their creams before choosing a fav but this one is amazing
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Australia,"Smell nice, brightening effect","I love the smell of this product, it have light and pleasant fruity smell. The texture is not too light or heavy and it absorb into my skin pretty quick, didnt leave sticky feeling. I feel like it moiturise my skin and make my skin brighter. Will buy it again. "
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Australia,Good find,"Definitely a good moisturiser but just didn’t last you long enough to make it price-sustainable product. I applied this day and night and I think it lasted me nearly 4 months. Once I massage the cream into my skin, I find that it sort of wake up my skin. Is hydrating, didn’t cause any irritation to my combo of dry/norm skin, significantly reducing the redness on my cheek (not clearing it entirely). For me, I love the nectar fragrance, however, if you are looking for a minimal or zero fragrance moisturiser, do not buy this. "
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Malaysia,feeling so so ,"Prefer rose cream instead, i have finished this product but did not see any significant changes for my face, feeling so so... there are better cream works better for my face with this price. I have dry combination skin. Will not repurchase this but I repurchase rose cream. "
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Malaysia,good product,"I would say it is a good moisturiser, best so far I have yet used. It has a good scent, but not too overpowering, texture is not too thick and it does its job helping your skin moisturised overnight. "
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Malaysia,Miss,This is one of my favourite moisturizers from FRESH. The smell is very nice and not empowering. I use it at night and wake up with soft and moisturised skin. I noticed that my dark spots are getting lighter too. 
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,Gives you many pimples,"Not a fan at all. I have nice skin and this product made me get pimples all over. Even on my neck I got pimples, which I never get"
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Malaysia,always a favourite,"the best moisturizer for me but not for my pocket. love the smell and my 'wake up"" face in the morning. you will get that super glow tha you've been yearned for. its a bit pricy, and i wish they can provide an applicator so that you dont need to use your fingers."
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,FRESH Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,I have used just about every moisturizer under the sun and this one is my favorite. I have repurchased it over 5 times. I've gotten my boyfriend and family hooked on it. Never makes any of us break out. Worth every penny!
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Singapore,fresh rarely disappoints ,Pampering my face with fresh makes it hard to go back to other (more affordable) brands lol. I’m moisturiser-hopping within fresh and I must say this one is just as good as the rest! 
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Australia,Amazing buy,"Like every other fresh product, this one doesn’t disappoint. Great absorbability. Skin feels supple and moisturised after applying it to sleep. Would repurchase."
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,New Zealand,Its okay!! ,I love Fresh products and that is why i was really into using this cream. Tbh expect the moisturizing my face did anothing else. 2stars for the smell and moisture. But glow nope!! I used it for 3months everyday trust me no change in glow or anything.. buy a cheaper moisturizer and it will do same thing! 
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Canada,Beware if you have a sensitive skin,"I just got this product, my face turns red when I use it. not sure if other people have the same problem."
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Malaysia,mrs,I love the refreshing smell of the product.. been using it as a night cream.. skin feels radiant and smooth... this is the second time i am purchasing this cream
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Australia,Miss ,"Smells great!!!!!!
I am yet to use it and see the difference in skin.
I have been using Rose range of Fresh skincare, which actually works. Hydrates skin and makes your face glow.
Hope this will work the same way."
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Singapore,not worth it,Bought this and I thought that jt could fix my problem but sadly it does not suit me and it’s so expensive would rather get bodyshop Vitamin C moisturiser so much cheaper than this 
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Malaysia,Love the smell ,Love the strong citrus smell of the product~ give me a freshness energy in the morning when I use it~ the moisturising effect is okay but not the best still.
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,Australia,silky and fragrant ,"Product is absorbed in the skin easily and smells beautiful. Have definitely noticed a change my skins texture as well as a slight glow. 
Will be purchasing again. 
"
FRESH-Vitamin Nectar Moisture Glow Face Cream,USA,"Feels good, scent not for me","The moisturizer feels great, but unfortunately I did not like the smell. In my opinion, the scent is very strong of vitamin C and not as much citrus- reminds me of drunk elephant vitamin C-Firma scent. I suggest going into a store and smelling the lotion before buying!"
DRGL-Moisturiser All Skin Types,Singapore,is this a liquid moisturiser? like toner?,Don’t like the dispenser pump because there’s a particular position to press it down. It’s a good way to lock for accidental pumps but difficult to see and find the correct position to press it down. It’s very light and liquid form. At first I thought the product is expired or spoilt. Easily absorbed. Expensive for such small amount. 
DRGL-Moisturiser All Skin Types,Singapore,Ms,this is quite good for oily skins. does not feel greasy and applies like liquid. but it is very pricey.
DRGL-Moisturiser All Skin Types,,not bad,"It’s really not bad at all. Has a great consistency and watery texture. However, it’s really really pricy and not for an average person’s wallet! It’s good but not sure if it’s worth the hefty price tag."
PHILOSOPHY-Ultimate Miracle Worker Night Multi-rejuvenating Nighttime Serum In Cream,Australia,didn’t see much difference ,"My face wasn’t dry which is always a plus sign but apart from that I don’t think this product made much difference. I used it with toner, essence, serum and oils. I wouldn’t purchase it again. "
PHILOSOPHY-Ultimate Miracle Worker Night Multi-rejuvenating Nighttime Serum In Cream,Australia,it’s ok,This is ok. It’s not nearly as good as Hope in A Jar Night. That cream was amazing and I hoped this would be similar or better. Not even close. I hope that Hope in A Jar Night makes a return. I wouldn’t buy this again.
PHILOSOPHY-Ultimate Miracle Worker Night Multi-rejuvenating Nighttime Serum In Cream,,Perhaps not very young skin,"I have oily-combination-sensitive skin. Mid 20s

I bought this product as I spotted some fine laugh lines and thought that I could use some of this on the rest of my face (prevention is better than cure??). 

However, this product caused me to develop some small pimples. Perhaps this is not suitable to those with my skin type. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Australia,Nice!,Bought this as a makeup artist recommended it because it hydrates but doesn’t interfere with the foundations. It is a nice moisturiser for spring-summer time or for very oily skin. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Australia,Nice and light ,I’m not a big fan of creamy consistency for moisturisers so love how this is a clear gel that absorbs into skin really well. So far my fave clinique moisturiser I’ve tried but I just don’t feel it’s moisturising enough to be used on its own. Nice and light if you’re only looking for something subtle though.
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Singapore,Good Moisturiser,"I usually use the Clinique gel moisturiser, and I decided to try this when it came out. Texture is really like jelly and I feel like it’s easier for the skin to absorb. Love that there is not much scent!"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Singapore,Ms,One of my favourite moisture for day time. The texture is light and non sticky. It’s suitable for combination to oily skin. Have been using this for many years and repurchased countless time. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Singapore,good,i really enjoyed using this. personally prefer jelly moisturizers as they dont feel oily and sticky after. feels cooling on application and lasts a long time. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,moustriser ,Best product so far for my dry n sensitive skin…… on my 4th bottle now!!! Super loving this gel watery like texture…….. not sticky or heavy on my skin for daily usage
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Singapore,Love the weightless feel,"Love the lightness of it. No sticky feeling. I have an oily skin, especially T-zone. My face becomes cakey sometimes with 'heavier' moisturizer, especially so with mask wearing. This doesn't and I love it! Will be re-purchasing this. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,Lovely Hydrating Product,"I saw and heard so many great review about this product. So I decided to buy and try this product. My first tried, I really impressed and feel so good after used this hydrating jelly ! This product are colour free , fragrance free and gave my combination skin type so moisture and hydrate. Amazing amazing amazing product !!!! This will be my MUST have item in my skincare product. I will keep continue use and purchase this great product. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Australia,good,"the product is good, for oily skin is perfect.  I believe there are products with better actives on the market and for the same price.  is a moisturizer only to be used after several serums with actives.  ok product that complements the skin routine.  but it's not THE BEST that we can't do without."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,an ok moisturizer for combination skin,"I think this is an ok moisturizer. I prefer the gel type better than this one. For my combination skin, this doesn’t really moisturising. But it always left my face look fresh 👍🏻"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,good ,It is such a great product … it isn’t the oily type … I have used 2 bottles of it … and I will continue using it … I have also recommended it to my friends 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,nice light moisturizing jelly ,"Good for combination to oily skin as the texture is quite light and fast absorption too. I would recommend this product to people that are looking for a lightweight daytime moisturizer, or people with oilier skin that can't use heavier moisturizers (like Clinique's Moisture Surge)"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,Suitable for my sensitive skin,"My skin is combination type, both dry and oily, and very sensitive. It is prone to acne. However, I have tried this product and surprisingly, it works with my skin type as it moistens my skin without any acne breakouts"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Australia,Not worth it ,This was the first product that I bought from this brand and it was useless for me to spend money on it. It claims to be hydrating but didn’t do much. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Australia,light weight ,"This product is perfect for those days you need that extra bit of hydration! Me I have super dry skin and I like to wear 2 moisturisers to give me that double hit of hydration!!!!! 
Also my skin is prone to breakouts and this keeps my skin clean and plump all day. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,Essesntial,Love this product. Fast hydrating on my skin so that i wont need to wait for a long time to wear my makeup and it really freshen my face also. Hve few bottles already and recommended. Will restock this again later
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Australia,"Lightweight, gel moisturiser for summer","This gel is super duper light and amazing for oily skin. I have no problem with the gel at all, but I think the pump is pretty hard to use. Its super stiff to push down on, and it launches this tiny droplet, which usually ends up in me wasting some moisturiser, other than the packaging I love this product."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Australia, better than average ,I have combination skin but mostly oily so I went for a gel moisturizer and it is good. it's not oily and just sinks into the skin. maybe not suitable for dry skin 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,New Zealand,The best hydrate w a good price,Nothing more to say - the bottle number 5 since now
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,lifesaver! ,"i am suffering from sensitive skin after a terrible breakout last year.. most of the moisturizer out there either break me out  ,or causing extra oil to my face.... this is the only product that worked on me... absorbs well to my skin  ,during day and night...it didnt caused me breakouts or bumps at all... my skin is feeling so smooth and hydrated now....  its a blessing to finally be able to find my HG !"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,good ,"The dramatically different hydrating jelly is suitable for my oily skin, feel light and non sticky in the morning and night. I will definitely repurchase this product as it make my skin feel fresh and moisturizing."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,Good for combination skin!,Truely in love with Clinique Dramtically Different Hydrating Jelly! It doesn’t cause stickiness and gets absorbed instantly into my skin after application. This is my second purchase! 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Singapore,lightweight moisturizer,I like the gel texture. didn't feel like it clogged pores. good for basic moisturizer. although I feel that I sometimes needs a bit more. so will use facial oil. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,clinique Review,After all it is moist and fast hydrate. So suitable for busy person not to wait to long. Better for Western people cause wether there cool and dry for my opinion 😀 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,New Zealand,MUST HAVE!,"I love this product, it does so much for my skin, it doesn’t feel heavy or irritate, it feels so gentle and hydrating and really stops me from breaking out. I suffer from allergies and find this stops irritation around my nose and sensitive areas on my face. Best product would highly recommend l. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,very good,I have try many product before. And this is the best moisturizer. Its really clear and I use it in the morning and evening. Its not sticky and its really moist and even my sensitive skin suit. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,It's okay,I wanted the Clinique ID set however my previous bottle ID did not come out until the hydrating jelly finish so I had to get a separate bottle without the ID so not to waste it. Clinique does have issues with their pump. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Singapore,Best Moisturizer ,This is the best moisturizer in the world. Have been using this for 2 years. It is so soothing on my sensitive skin. It won’t clog pores. It calms my skin. This is the best product from Clinique. Can’t live without this moisturizer. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Singapore,hmmm,"The texture isn’t as much as a jelly as it is supposed to be, it ends up feeling quite sticky and doesn’t absorb very well into skin leaving a tacky feeling ! Unfortunately I won’t get again "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,Second purchase!,Love the lightweight gel texture and still moisturize my face! I have a combo skin type and this one works for me. It has very minimal harmful ingredients which I love about this product <3
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Singapore,Favourite moisturiser so far!,I’m having a combination and sensitive skin. I applied it every day time straight after my cleanser and I can feel that my skin has drinks enough water. Will definitely re-purchase it again! 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Singapore,whiteheads gone?,I never had any positive experience with gel moisturisers and I wasn't fully expecting this to work. But application was comfortable and it was more hydrating than my current moisturiser. Was really hoping this would work get rid of my whiteheads and it did. A star off because I hoped it would be more moisturising. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Singapore,Oily and acne prone skin,I was dealing with really bad acne and this moisturiser is one of the things that helped me to fight my acne. This moisturiser never made my skin feel heavy or greasy. In fact after I applied it absorbed into my skin immediately. Really good ingredient list too.
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,New Zealand,fungle acne,"I have fungle acne and this one work well for my skin. It doesnt cause any irritation. However, its not very moisturized so I use serum and toner as well"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,Really good and light,"This is a really good and light moisturiser. A little goes a long way. However, that is all it does. It only moisturises and serves it purpose. it might not be enough if you live in a dry environment but perfect for those living in warm humid conditions. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Australia,Hydrating Jelly,I use this in the morning with my skin because it’s oily and it works really great it comes with a pump and a lid which I didn’t realise it had the bottles are bit small than I thought it was it’s slightly sticky and it’s good for underneath your foundation
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Singapore,Love their skincare,"I really like Clinique's products. They're easier on the pocket, last long and are very soft on the skin. They don't make a dramatic difference but are good for long term use."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Australia,go-to day time moisturiser,"this is a repeat purchase for me now, it's a fantastic day time moisturiser. the gel texture is really nice and it absorbs immediately without any residue. goes on underneath makeup without causing any problems. sometimes i use at night as well if i'm feeling lazy but i wouldn't recommend it for that use exclusively if you have anything bordering on even slightly dry skin. deff a day product IMO but basically a HG in that sense!! "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Australia,love this product ,Very hydrating without leaving the skin feeling oily! So light on the skin but you can feel the hydration! Amazing product! Will be re purchasing! Love this product 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,Ms,"Not suitable for dry skin. I m combination dry skin type. It makes my skin lack of moisture, instead of hydrating as shown in the description. However, it may suits to oily skin as the texture is so light."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,meh,Not sure why this is a thing but okay la maybe those with oily skin would enjoy. It’s not hydrating for me. I only use this after gym sessions for a quick routine before going back home
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,Ordinary,"The face ia refreshing，moisturising and repairing.Suitable for all skin types .Absorbs quickly ,non oil and non sticky . You can use it for about half a year."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,Plump & Juicy Skin In A Bottle,"I have reviewed this before (30ml) as it became my holy grail moisturizer that is just enough moisturising while not oily for my oily skin, got this in the largest size available because it is so good and will be continue repurchasing it. Super tempted to try the lotion one but still highly recommend this, double thumbs up."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Singapore,Absorbs fast,"This is great for day time use. It's a little sticky for the first 10 seconds but then it sinks into your skin and you'll forget it was ever there. 
I don't find it hydrating enough for evening use. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,favorite!,one of my favorite moisturiser as it's not too oily for my skin. i have a dry combination skin hence it will get oily at my T zone area after long hours. but this jelly moisturiser does it's job well and wouldn't make my face shine with oil by the end of the day. loving the cooling jelly texture once applied on my face as well. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,Good Product,"No fragrance and quite moisture, recommend for combination skin. And it's suitable for summer too! The price is quite expensive but it worth a try! Recommended!"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Singapore,Good enough to try once,"Made my skin moisturised for roughly 4 hours before turning it oily. It improved the condition of my pores and acne scars gradually however this stopped after i finish 3/4 of the bottle. The production slowly made my skin oily to touch so i stopped using it and switched over to another moisturiser. Overall would still recommend but will get the smaller size to test how it performs on my skin first
"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,Fav. Moisturizer,Certainly one of my most favourite skincare. The fact that there is no colouring and smell adds extra points to it being amazing on your skin. Also great for lazy days in which we skip everything else but our moisturizer.
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,suit for combination oily skin ,"I m combination oily skin and will have blemish and acne sometimes. I use this dramatically different hydrating jelly on daytime. And I use the pink color one , the 72 hrs auto replenishing on night time . It really work for combination oily skin . Will repurchase again 😄"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,I love Clinique ❤️,My skin is very hydrated and soft after i use this cream. I have really enjoyed this moisturizer. It feels like a jelly yet not too heavy or greasy. I have dry skin so my skin is sensitive. Sometimes when my skin feels dryer than usual I have used this in the daytime as well. This moisturizer is very reasonably priced and will continue to be in my routine.
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Australia,Awful.,"That thing irritated my skin, gave me redness and I ended up using it on my body. Idk why tho, because the level of hydration is minus 100! Don't like the ingredients either. Clinique is not what it seams, it's not that skin friendly. Please, analyse the ingredients before you buy. And go wit First Aid Beauty instead of this gimmick.  "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Australia,great texture!,Love the texture of this product! Nice and light texture and still hydrates the face without it feeling oily. Will keep purchasing. I use this morning and night. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,worth it. ,"Not sticky at all, and it hydrates my skin really well. Use it every day after toning and  before thicker cream.Definitely worth to have! Looking forward for this product!"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,good! ,"Been religiously using this moisturiser for more than a year now. I have a combination skin, and it hydrates pretty well without leaving any oily residue. My boyfriend uses this also occasionally and he has dry skin.  
Also a bottle lasts up to 3 months for me. worth the money! 
Would like to try moisture surge after finishing my current bottle, only to see which one works better on my skin! "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Malaysia,good,"I really like this moisturizer. The jelly texture id perfect for combination/oily skin. It is also suitable for dehydration. I have combination skin with tendency to dehydration. The product also does exist in oil free, or rich formula, so it will be suitable for different skin type. The packaging is great because it’s a pump bottle so it’s easy to use, to carry and it’s more hygenic. For this product, you need to buy the product itself and the concentrate pump separately. They have four different concentrate for different skin problematics "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,Singapore,good,"Feel so great cos Sephora did selling travel size easy for me to give my kids for try Both having oily skin and acne problem , but this product won't make their skin feel sticky or dry , they started to like this product."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Good serum for normal to oily skin,"I bought this for my husband who doesn't apply anything on his face.  I got him this one and he loves it.  It absorbs easily, non-fragrance and doesn't leave any sticky/oily residue on his face.  He has normal skin.  "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,fav since forever!,"i’ve using this moisturizer since a long time ago. first i use the dramatically different gel, then i tried this jelly one and i love it more! the texture is more watery than the gel one so it absorbs faster! very suitable on my oily skin."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,hydrating jelly," I prefer this product over the moisture surge. This product does a better job in retaining moisture of my skin under makeup. Not to mention, it’s cheaper too! This is my second bottle and I do regret buying the moisture surge. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,miss,"I love this moisturizer so much. When i apply it, its feel so hydrate and when i wake up in the morning, my skin feels so great and smooth. Will repurchase it!"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,easy to absorb,"I already used the mini size one the one in the small tub 7ml or something and i love it. So i decided to buy the full size one. The bottle is super gigantic didnt expect it to be that big. Overall a very nice moisturizer that is easily to absorb and suitable for oily skin like mine. Having no trouble trying this 
out. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Breakouts :(,"Loved the idea of oil free because obviously it is a clear jelly form of moisturizer and not opaque creme form. But got me so disappointed. I had break outs after first use at night. But I held onto it and used it for a second time on another day. Just to be sure and ensure that I've isolated the cause. Broke out again, this time was worst, with itchy rashes. But that is only for my skin. So obviously, I don't like it. I just hope it didn't. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Love adore,"i have super sensitive skin that break out easily, but this moisturiser has been nothing but great haven't  had any breakouts since i purchased it a couple of months ago. its not oily and doesn't block my pores, its great for people with sensitive skin "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Lightweight,"Moisturiser is really lightweight for day use. Especially under the ever important sunscreen. If I do decide to add serums underneath it, it doesn’t pill on the skin. Great everyday moisturiser with no fuss."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Good Product,"I really enjoy using this product because of its light watery/gel like texture. I don’t find it hydrating enough on its own, hence the reason I use it more as a serum than a moisturiser. I cleanse my face, apply Clinique DD jelly, I then apply whatever treatment I’m using followed by a thicker moisturiser. Since my skin can be quite sensitive, I like to apply my active ingredients/treatments after I’ve put on the jelly. I find that this reduces the chances of inflammation. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Natural Feeling Skin,"This is my go-to moisturiser. Morning and night. When you first apply it there is kind of a tacky feeling, but that disappears not long after and you're left with really natural feeling skin. No fragrance which is wonderful and it doesn't leave my face feeling oily. It's especially great because I don't sweat it off. Can't recommend it more!"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Love this gel! ,"Such a nice gel! And such a great price. Really lovley under make up especially for oily skin gals!!! And 125ml!!! Amazing!!! It’s similar to using aloe Vera gel, but a lot more hydrating! "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,hydrating gel,"I am oily skin and it suit me well. it won't be oily and absorb faster into skin so it suitable for oily skin. if I am lazy I will apply only this in the morning, and that's enough for my skin to keep hydrated whole day.
"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Ms,"I have super oily skin and this is so far the best gel type moisturiser available in the market. However, there is one ingredient, even though at a really low concentration will cause fungal acne. Hence, I am still in the search for the perfect hydrating gel."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Lightweight fuss free moisturizer,Very light on the skin absorbs quickly. Fuss free moisturiser that doesn't interfere with makeup. Affordable for the quantity. Good for day time but need to layer with a serum at night.
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,im not so sure,"They blend and absorbed into my skin just fine. Its not sticky, so thats a plus with our hot climate. But i dont really see the “dramatically hydrating” part? I think its a pretty solid non day time moisturiser. Pretty simple. But I may would change to the cream formula for my next one."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,GREAT MOISTURIZER,It suits perfectly with my skin and didn't break me out after usage. It is light and makes my skin better the next day. I would highly recommend this to everyone!
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Excellent choice,"At first I was a bit sceptical with this product.  it is my first time ever to purchase jelly-based moisturiser.  Although my skin is super sensitive and dry, my face loves it so much!!!! My skin receives the moisture as claim, without feeling dry.  A bit pricey, but I l use it in the morning and night.  "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Worth it,"I have been using this for a month now in conjuction with the rest of my skincare rountine and my face is SUPER clear. Great in warmer weather/climates as it doesnt feel like your face is melting and ""slimy"" after application. Also great to put on before makeup as its not like a normal moisturiser. Will continue to use this. 125ml was bigger than I expected too. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Refreshing and hydrating ,Really love this. Have been using Clinique’s dramatically different gel before this but this has become my go to day moisturiser. It doesn’t leave an oily layer behind after application and gets absorbed really quickly. It doesn’t clog my pores and doesn’t make my sensitive skin react. Would recommend!
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Really hydrating!,First Clinique product! Started using this as soon as I got it. 125mL is a good amount and will last quite a while given only a small amount is needed. Definitely re-purchasing!
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Great moisturiser,has a very nice texture. Easy to put on the face. Dries up very nicely. Not sticky at all. I prefer this to the dramatically different gel. will definitely buy more once I run of this current bottle!
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Jelly!,I absolutely love this jelly moisturizer! It's light but it does wonders on moisturizing and plumping your skin. I also love how it's not tacky after application. Holy grail for sure!!!
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,perfect ,Super good formula as it absorbs right away into your skin without leaving any smell and sticky texture. Very hydrating and highly recommended for dry skin peeps. Apply Once a day in the morning before your primer and foundation would be really helpful 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Not suitable for my dry & sensitive skin,"I've been using the Clinique Moisture Surge 72-hour Auto Replenishing Hydrator (which I consider to be the holy grail of moisturizers) & decided to give Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly a try, as it is considerably cheaper. But upon trying, I realize that this product is not at all a substitute to Moisture Surge. If you have dry and sensitive skin, give this product a pass, and go for Moisture Surge instead. However, my sister who has oily combination skin likes this product."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Lightweight and Feels Great on Skin,I have combination (oily on the T-zone areas) and sensitive skin. The transparent jelly-like attracted me to purchase the travel size (30ml) to test it out first. I love its lightweight and water-based texture and it gets absorbed into the skin quickly. Most importantly it does not feel sticky after application! It does hydrate my skin and I get lesser breakouts. So I went on with the big bottle and no regrets! 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Great moisturizer,"This moisturizer is awesome. It does not leave any stickiness on my skin, which i really love. It does not cause me breakout or redness. Maybe to light for dry skin user, not hydrate enough for them."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,thumbs up,"tried almost EVERY lotion. I have had super dry skin, since using this product I have seen a difference .use it every day after toning and before thicker cream moisturizer. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,best jelly base produxt ever,It is works on me as my face is sensitive to cream product. It is not really a highly hydrating product but it did moisturised. I will apply it daily and after apply cliniqie 72 hours moisturiser . Double moisturizing. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,My view after using it,Definitely worth to have! My face is totally not oily after using it while my skin is hydrated! I hope it can  continue bettering my skin! Looking forward!
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,I love this,"This is not oily and sticky at all, and it hydrates my skin really well without making it look greasy by the end of the day. It doesn’t clog my pores or break me out either"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,perfect for hot and humid weather ,it is great to use for a daily moisturiser in Singapore's  hot and humid weather. recommended for oily skins as it does not clog up pores. i have sensitive skin and it works great on me. doesn't feel sticky as well. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Good moisturizing product,"Non sticky, non oily, suitable for day and night. My savior skin care when traveling to places with cold weather. Pair up will with the Clinique Moisture Surge moisturizer."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,hmm,this was bought for my sister as she was excited for the benefits advertised by clinique - anti pollution. So far she comment that it is similar to moisture surge gel. It is more hydrating than moisture surge gel but texture is similar. Overall might not repurchase this as im sure theres more better products out there..
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,very good,I tried this and it’s really quite good. The consistency is very easy to spread and absorbs into the skin easily. Does not leave a tacky feeling. Good for day and night.
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,diffuse to your skin,so far im loving this even i dont feel satisfied enough as i cant feel THE mosturiser-kinda-feel on top of ur skin. i know it is a good thing as we won't go greasy at the end of the day. 😂
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Will repurchase ,I was offered a sample at the mall and when I tried it on my face before bed I was in love. It absorbed into my skin quicker then most products and my face felt nourished. I felt like this was too good to be true.  
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,My holy grail,"Frankly speaking, i had been using it almost more than 3 months. This is the best moisturiser for oily + sensitivei skin type. Very lightweight, soothing and hydrating. Worth every penny!"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,BEST MOISTURISER EVER,"I coach swimming and this product solved ALLLLLL my dehydrated skin issues. I have combo skin but the chlorine dries me out so badly. This works amazing before make up, in flight, before and after swimming. There’s nothing that can compare to this!!!"
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,So-so,Decided to purchase this as it seemed like an interesting product. Unfortunately i was quite disappointed because it doesn’t really hydrate my skin?? I used it underneath my make up and my skin looked SO DRY. Plus it is not cheap so 2 stars.
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,highly recommended ,"First time trying clinique’s product and I think this is a good start if you haven’t try any clinique’s product and is looking for a moisturizer. Will definitely buy it again! After applying, my skin feels much more moisturized and hydrated. "
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,terbaik,saya mempunyai masalah kulit kering. pelembab ini membantu mengatasi masalah kulit kering yang saya hadapi. gelnya yang mudah menyerap membuatkan kulit saya bebas minyak. 
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Best moisturizer for combination and sensitive skin,"Overall, it is a good moisturizer. It doesn't leave the skin greasy or oily. It absorb almost immediately and give a healthy glow and hydration. However, the hydration is not long lasting. That's why I have to give four stars for this moisturizer."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,Refreshing Choice,"IF you find the old formula is too heavy, this might be the choice for you.Super light weight and you can layer another product on more more moisture."
CLINIQUE-Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly,,NON STICKY AT ALL ,"I seldom see a skin care in jelly/gel form with a gentle ingredients. but this bottle does. this is my first time purchase, i will observe whether the result is similar as how it claims. anyway, so far it never cause break out. non sticky and feeling fresh. "
DIOR-Capture Youth Age-Delay Advanced Crème Moisturiser,Singapore,Hmmm…. meh…,"Someone who works in Sephora and who attended to me years ago said to me that for Christian Dior’s products, it’s just about the brand and advertising. I didn’t quite believe. So years later, I decided to try this…. Well, the person said it right. It does nothing to my face. But at least there’s no breakout. I won’t purchase this again. "
DIOR-Capture Youth Age-Delay Advanced Crème Moisturiser,Australia,Meh,Thought I’d invest in some nice cream but I only use it once in awhile. It gets really flaky on your skin when you use it at the end of your routine and I have little white bits on my face I have to keep flicking off.
DIOR-Capture Youth Age-Delay Advanced Crème Moisturiser,Singapore,one of the best! perfecr for normal or combi skin,"this is like the better version of Clarins' Multi Active Moisturizer. Smells amazing, the scent is very similar but not so strong as clarins. the texture is similar with clarins too, its in between clarins and lamer soft cream in terms of the texture and how oily you feel on the face, its a soft cream but not heavy feeling on the skin, my skin absorbs it well. my face is not that oily or dry after a long day unlike lamer which i need to put less so my face wont be too greasy. i think i found the balance and perfect moisturizer for my normal/combi skin. i can put my skii/clarins/or origins sunscreen on top of it during day time and my face wont be greasy. when feeling lazy i can even put this on my under eye skin and whole face and wake up with a glowy face. i sleep under aircon and day time working inside an industrial factory and i dont need to switch moisturizer because it can be use for both colder or warmer environment. the price is very worth it. "
DIOR-Capture Youth Age-Delay Advanced Crème Moisturiser,Australia,Super nice,"Feels really nice on, a little sticky but I feel like it’s doing it’s job... I use it with capture youth mattifying serum and they go well together. The smell is not so fragrant "
DIOR-Capture Youth Age-Delay Advanced Crème Moisturiser,Australia,Lovely,"Very nice, useful and elegant product as expected with any Dior product. The application with the spatula is great and the packaging beautiful as well and it does feel nice on the skin, it is definitely a cream not a gel or similar.
Be careful not to apply too much on your face because it doesn’t absorb as quickly, so upon application, after the serum, I have to apply the smallest portion, enough to cover my face basically, “a little goes a long way” for sure!

I love it despite the not quick absorption. "
DIOR-Capture Youth Age-Delay Advanced Crème Moisturiser,Singapore,moisturiser ,"1st time getting this dior moisturiser and try , the smell is so nice and light texture. I'm combinations skin type is good to use after all recommended to those oily skin too . use after dior serum is much more better n smoother "
DIOR-Capture Youth Age-Delay Advanced Crème Moisturiser,Singapore,Not Too Advance Creme,"I leveled up to this creme as I expected some advancement given the increase in price point. My baseline is Dior Life Sorbet creme. However, this advance creme did not give any significant advance results from my baseline. It is still a great creme though. Gives moisturised skin perfect under Dior Dreamskin.

SULWHASOO-Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX Classic,Singapore,Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX Classic,"I appreciate how Sulwhasoo made their products as each and every one of them is truly well thought. This 'Classic' cream is an antiaging moisturiser for dry skin. Lovely to use at night as it penetrates slowly, feels like you're constantly layering the cream and it leaves your skin real dewy. Oh and the ginseng scent might be a bit much for first time users but you'll love it in no time. I know I did."

It has a very nice and strong ginseng scent which I find to be quite soothing. Given the high price point, I tend to use this once a week (paired with the ginseng eye cream). Whilst not my holy grail, I might consider repurchasing as a weekly pick-me-up. "

SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Australia,"Light, hydrated perfection! ","Great product that actually works and is better than more expensive brands. Simple and easy to use, very highly recommended. Will purchase again and again."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Australia,Water Cream,"I have combination oily skin and am big fan of water creams and this is one of my favourites. Nice and hydrating, feels cooling and a little goes a long way. "
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Australia,average ,Too light for my dry skin - definitely didn’t feel hydrated…. Shame I really wanted to love this moisturizer as I have tried other products from this range 
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Australia,Exactly what I was looking for,"I have struggled to find a face moisturiser for so long that I used to just skip it as part of my routine for many years (not good, I know). I always found other moisturisers, even most oil free ones, too heavy and sticky and I just hated they way they'd leave my face feeling oily.

But this one is absolutely perfect, super light-weight, and it absorbs really nicely into the skin so that I'm not left with that sticky feeling I hate. My skin feels super bouncy and clear, I'm definitely sticking to this one!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Australia,SATURDAY SKIN Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,This cream is so nice! It is so light weight but still so hydrating which I love. Doesn't feel sticky or leave a layer on the skin. Sinks right in and makes the skin feel like silk with a nice glow 
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,New Zealand,Gorgeous product ,"Can't wait to repurchase this overnight moisteriser. I got this as a treat for myself and I'm almost disappointed that I love it so much - I could smother my body in this and it still wouldn't be enough. The only disappointing part is that it's a bit pricey, but it has been the best overnight moisteriser that I've used to date. The consistency is like water in a gel form, and the density makes you feel like you're putting your face into I don't know... a cloud full of water! It feels luxurious, rich, and like you're giving yourself a heavenly moisture treatment. This has been better than moisturising face masks that I've purchased in the past - would highly recommend. "
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Australia,Amazing ,"I love this product, it leaves my face so moisturised although leaves a slight residue so I highly recommend using it at night. Packaging is adorable."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Australia,Great hydration ,"Hydration with this waterfall glacier water cream was superb. loved it 😍 
must buy product. Bit on higher end cost wise but worth the money.
will buy again."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Malaysia,best moisturizer ever,"This saved my skin so much! I have dry-oily acne prone skin and this has become my skin saver. It really calms my skin down. Been using this for over a year. Whenever my skin acting up, I will go back to basics and this would help my skin heal. Highly recommended! 

My only packaging is the jar, its unhygenic, so bulky and hard to travel with. Had to transfer to smaller jar for travel. Its also very pricey.
"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Malaysia,Love!,This moisturiser is simple and easy to use for those with oily / combination skin. It does not cause breakouts and it’s a gel based moisturiser and not a heavy cream one.
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Malaysia,Not too impressive,Ingredients-wise quite good. But after a month of using I don’t see much difference to my skin. The formula and texture is like a thick gel so it leaves that sticky feeling. Not a great one.
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Australia,Mrs ,Water Glacier Water Cream is my new favourite moisturiser!! Feel so hydrated when I apply to my face! It’s perfect for my sensitive skin with no stinging. 
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Malaysia,Fragrance free moisturiser ,First time purchasing this and generally quite happy with this product. It is fragrance free and leaves skin hydrated and soft. Great for anyone who has oily and combination skin too. 
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Malaysia,Good Product & Good Quality,"My First try👍🏻 the best mositurizer i have try. This moiturizer so good for my oily skin. Sometimes combination skin. Because its water based so suitable for my skin. Its also can make my face so bright, glowing & feel more hydration when using it day & night👍🏻  The best moisturizer ever! 👏🏻🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Malaysia,repurchase,Repurchase it bc it was on sale. Tried it when i got trial pack. Fell in love with it and bought one tub. So this is my 2nd tub. It actually suits my combi oily dry skin. Its gellish. Abit sticky but few seconds it will go away as ur skin will absorb it. It does control my oil but can be pily again if i was extra sweating
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Saturday Skin Waterfall Glacier Water Cream - 50ml,"I don’t generally need a lot in the moisturizer department, and a big majority of moisturizers out there just never absorb into my skin. When I found water gels and creams it was a total game changer! I love this for daytime use, as it’s not even slightly greasy, and I also use it at night under a heavier moisturizer that locks in the hydration this water cream provides. I am obsessed with the texture of this product, and I love that it’s unscented!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Philippines,"Lightweight, good for oily skin","As someone with normal to oily skin, it has been difficult for me to find a moisturizer that doesn't feel too greasy, heavy, or sticky on my skin. This is absolutely perfect for me, whether I use it during the day or at nighttime, without makeup or underneath makeup. I also find that it doesn't cause my skin to breakout unlike other moisturizers of similar textures. I will definitely repurchase."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Australia,cute but not it ,"Cream is super sticky if you use too much. No scent. Gel like texture. Purchased it due to excellent reviews but it’s nothing special. 

Packaging is cute. "
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Malaysia,Saturday on your skin! ,It is very hydrating. The texture is thick and rich. No fragrance for sure. Suitable for those with sensitive skin. It is not oily. Very light to your skin. 
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,keeps your skin hydrated and grips onto makeup,"This is my favorite day time moisturizer. It’s awesome for underneath makeup! It’s sticky, which makes it perfect to grip onto your makeup and keep it on. On top of it being perfect for makeup, it’s super hydrating and keeps me from getting flaky."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Re-design Container,"Really love this moisturizer, but I think they need to re-package the full-size container — at least add a thin inner cap to help seal the product better in-between uses.

I deduced this need because my first experience with this moisturizer was in a sample-sized jar.  The product was presumably freshly manufactured, the feeling of the moisturizer was fabulous in dry desert air, and the moisturizing effects continued in more Mediterranean weather.

I bought the full-size and immediately noticed stickiness.  There was no stickiness in the sample size.

Additionally, the full-size jar leaks when tilted on its side.  The product that oozes out becomes thick and tacky.

I don’t know how long the full-size jar was hanging on the shelf before I bought it, but with the less-tight lid I can see how evaporation messed with the product.  I foresee a shelf life of less than the 12-months labeled on the jar."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Canada,1000000000000 STARS,"STOP & JUST BUY THIS!! 
This is absolutely amazing!! Its the only cream that has truly deeply hydrated my skin and gave me long lasting hydrated, glowing and fresh skin!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Good but a little sticky,"Was looking for a new gel moisturizer and this one was highly recommended. I do like it, but it ends up being a little bit sticky when it settles down. Other than that it does a great job at moisturizing without being greasy."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Saturday Skin Waterfall Glacier Water Cream - 50ml,I have oily skin so this cream didn’t work for me. It is pretty thick and left my skin very tacky after application (which is my biggest problem with skincare products). I’d say this is definitely a cream meant for people with dry skin
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Singapore,"Lovely, lightweight moisturiser ",This moisturiser is really lightweight. Skin still feels breathable after using this. Was mainly using this for the morning. Use something more hydrating for the night routine. 
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Saturday Skin Waterfall Glacier Water Cream - 50ml,Obsessed to the last drop. Feels so light on my skin which is perfect for this summer heat. Absorbs into the skin so quickly and makes you ✨glow✨ definitely gonna have to repurchase
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Sticky,"Super Sticky, thick.. not good for my oily skin.
feels like I’m using a thick ointment."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Singapore,Great Moisturiser,This product is really moisturising. Though it did not worked for my skin well I have a sensitive skin. But I don’t blame the product if you’re extremely dry it might work for you.
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Perfect!,"I really don't understand why people are saying this is sticky. I've tried so many different face creams but this one is amazing. And it's a lot cheaper than most I've tried which is a plus. I have dry/sensitive skin and I was worried this wouldn't be enough when I saw ""water"" in the name. But this is perfect. Not too thick and enough to keep my skin moisturized. Didn't break me out at all and never felt sticky. my  makeup glided over this with zero problems and didn't ball up like others are saying. It absorbed quickly. Love it!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Canada,"Great for Oily, Acne Prone and Sensitive Skin","I'm oily, acne prone and sensitive. The trifecta of problem skin but this lightweight yet hydrating cream was perfect. It's expensive so it's challenging to re-buy often. But it's one of the best face creams I've used with no side effects."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,EXCELLENT MORNING SKIN!,"I’ve been slathering this gel on at night after cleansing and toning. I wake up with super smooth, glass like texture. I was having flaky itchy skin and that was why I ordered this. After just five days of using this cream, my flakes are gone and my face is so freaking smooth now. Large pores on my nose didn’t get clogged up using this cream. It feels sticky when you put it on and takes over night to absorb and become smooth. Pretty magical!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Malaysia,Sticky hydration ,First time purchasing the full size tub because I liked the sample given previously. Started off nice to use but after awhile became too thick/sticky for my skin because of my natural oils that came with stress. Suggest to use this product at night. 
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Australia,Ok,I have super dry skin and thought I'd give this a go because it sounded good but it fell a bit short for me. it's a gel like consistency and not quite as hydrating as I like. My makeup did look great over it though.
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Philippines,good but sticky,Title says it all. It’s a good moisturizer. But it’s just a bit sticky on the face. So it makes my face look super oily. So I tend to only use this at night. I most likely won’t be repurchasing cause I was hoping for a moisturizer I can use both for AM and PM. 
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Australia,Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,"I have been using this as my day cream for a few months now and I am very happy with the results. My skin is usually oily, sensitive and acne prone but this cream seemed to work well for me. It is quite thick and feels sticky initially but after a minute it absorbs and makes skin look fresh, plump and smooth. I only need to use a very small amount and I haven't had any breakouts since using it."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Saturday Skin Waterfall Glacier Water Cream - 50ml,"I've been a die hard tatcha water cream user because I have super sensitive skin and severe acne so I dare not change my routine willy nilly. this cream though!! LOVE IT. it's light, clean and not oily or congesting but still moisturizing. love love love it."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Singapore,oily combo skin,"really love this alot! absorb into my skin easily and especially with the whole covid situation, with maks wearing, my skin has been dry but after using this omg. love it!!!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Australia,"bad times, sad times",I got this in the mail recently and was incredibly disappointed at how sticky this was and returned immediately. Interesting as I had previously received a sample that was not as sticky so maybe they have reviewed the formula...
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Canada,Saturday Skin Waterfall Glacier Water Cream - 50ml,"I’m usually not a fan of water creams or gel creams because they’re too light for my skin but HOLY, this cream is amazing. It’s perfect for someone who needs extra moisture but doesn’t want to feel like they slathered their face in a thick cream (especially with summer coming). It feels luxurious when applying and I never have to reapply. Just fantastic."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Malaysia,subs for clinique 72hours mosturiser ,The best find I discovered because I’m on my 2nd tub now and it is slightly cheaper than Clinique’s ones. It more or less has the same consistency and effects and I’d say its a good substitute plus the packaging is so darn cute cause you can repurpose it once finished or just recycled em
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,sticky after application,Leaves my skin feeling sticky. Doesn’t feel like it absorbs well at all
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,"Sticky, makeup rolls","This feels hydrating when you put it on! But I would only recommend wearing it at night, as it's extremely sticky and causes your makeup to roll off and not adhere. I was wondering why my skin looked like it was peeling. I had a travel size, won't be repurchasing."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Malaysia,lightweight,I really love this moisturizer. Lightweight and not sticky.. The down side is only it comes in a jar which is quite troublesome that you need clean spatula to scoop out some of the product. But overall i love.
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Australia,LOVE,"Really love the weightless hydrating feel of this silicone free moisturiser. This is my 3rd replenish!! Would highly recommend not just this product but the whole brand. 
"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Canada,Saves my Skin!,"I keep coming back to this again and again. I'm on my 5th jar. I have sensitive, combination, acne prone, fair skin. Almost everything I use doesn't agree with my skin except this moisturizer. It's saved my skin so many times after reactions to other products.  I love the texture, the lack of fragrance and that is has the Clean at Sephora check. If you apply too much, yes it will feel tacky for a little while. For those with issues about a tacky feeling, taper back your use to a few small dabs instead of slathering it on. You really don't need much for it to work. I even use it in the morning under my make-up."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Saturday Skin Waterfall Glacier Water Cream - 50ml,It's thicker than I expected for something with water in the name and it's still sticky 2 hours after putting it on. My skin does feel hydrated though.
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Saturday Skin Waterfall Glacier Water Cream - 50ml,"My skin is dry and I normally don’t like water or gel moisturizers, they just don’t fit me , this cream didn’t not do anything not even basic moisturizing effect, it actually made my skin worse , and i also had burning sensation after using."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Get that soft glass skin!,"I got a sample of this a while back and used every bit of it so I bought the full size. I have very dry skin and I’m trying to heal my moisture barrier. Yes, this is sticky especially if you use too much, but I put it on a few hours before I actually go to sleep so it has time to absorb before I go to sleep and it has done wonders for me. My face feels soft again and I’m so happy. I’ve tried so many things and this is by far my favorite."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,just try it already!!!,"If you’re thinking of getting this for oily or combo, acne prone skin, I highly recommend! This cream is perfect for me! It has a light and smooth gel like texture and does wonders to hydrate skin.  I have not experienced any breakouts from this and I love that it is fragrance free as well.  I have noticed a lot of people saying that after applying the cream, their face remains sticky. I have not experienced this once since using. After about 2-5 mins, the stickiness from the cream goes away for me.  I apply it by putting small dots onto all of my face and then rubbing it in with my fingertips.  When first using this, I noticed a little bit of stinging from it directly after applying it, but after about three days, it never happened again.  One thing I also noticed is that if I don’t apply enough of it, my face tends to still feel dry, so I make sure to use a blueberry sized amount for my whole face.  I use this during the day, and something heavier at night with my prescription acne medication.  Even though the price is high, I love this cream too much to not have it so I will for sure be repurchasing!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,alittle sticky,After an hour of putting it on still leaves a very sticky feeling on the skin but does feel moisturized. I only use it at night better for dryer skin
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,really enjoyed!,This is super lightweight and doesn’t leave your skin feeling oily at all afterwards! Was very impressed!
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Malaysia,Good price,"My skin type is combination to dry. It does the work, moisturizing when applied. But when it isn’t applied, my skin feels tight. Especially after wash, like isn’t moisturized enough. Good price though for that amount of product. Didn’t really fancy the plastic packaging."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Canada,Definitely worth it!,"My skin can easily get oily from some moisturizers but after my sister-in-law suggested this- was a true game changer. It’s lightweight, goes on like nothing and my skin breathes and doesn’t feel heavy. 

Anyone who struggles with some oiliness and wants to try a water-based product—I highly recommend!! 

I have used First Aid Beauty, Innisfree, Skinfx and liked this one way more."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Saturday Skin Waterfall Glacier Water Cream - 50ml,I love this moisturizer. I tend to have oily skin with large pores and adding this to my routine has definitely helped! I haven’t had any issues with it feeling sticky or tacky at all. It’s lightweight and leaves a lovely dewy glow on no makeup days. I will be repurchasing when it runs out- which won’t be for a while since a little goes a long way!
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,yes!,"Absolutely my favorite moisturizer! Gentle, light weight, but packed with the right amount of everything for sensitive skin. Gives a lovely glow!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,too tacky,Received as a gift. Was excited to try the water cream but it unfortunately feels tacky on my skin. Hate the feeling of it. Doesn’t seem like a healthy moisturizer for my skin. My skin is very normal to dry in winter.
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Canada,Saturday Skin Waterfall Glacier Water Cream - 50ml,"Pros: wake up with soft skin, not irritating. 
Cons: Clogs all my pores, feels like I have slime on my face does not absorb well, uncomfortable"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Left me sticky!,This left me with a sticky residue. Not a fan. And the giant jar takes up a lot of space.
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,BEST EVER! Feels incredible on your skin,"This is my favorite moisturizer EVER! I have oily and acne-prone skin and this will NOT cause breakouts. It has no scent and feels incredible when you apply it. I don't think it is actually ""cooling"" but it has a cool and refreshing feel to it - hence the ""glacier water"" maybe. I love putting this on in the morning after washing my face, I feel ultra refreshed and glowy. The packaging great in my opinion. When companies give you an open canister like this, you waste zero product. If this came in a spray or bottle we would lose too much product. The only complaint I have is that the pink plastic feels a little hospital-like or little girl like. I'd love to see a more sleek or glass jar, comparable with glow recipe. I got this in BoxyCharm a long time ago, used every last drop, and now I cannot go without it."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Canada,Issa no...,"Not worth the money to me. My skin still feels extremely dehydrated after using this, it leaves a strange film that takes several washes to get off."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Singapore,Light weighted and hydrating ,"My skin is between normal to combination. I tend to avoid moisturizer if the texture is too thick or creamy. However, this gel is light weighted and very hydrating. Love it! "
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Malaysia,love it ,I love this product so much. Suitable for my skin in combination. Bigger sizes. In love with this product. Hope one-day I can buy full set of this product. 
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,"Amazing product, dumb packaging","Is great for my sensitive, combo, cystic acne prone skin- but the packaging- whyyy?! Please change this into a squirt bottle. Thinking about buying little spatulas and doing it myself..."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Malaysia,Very Light,Korean Made. Quite a big tub for RM 150. Might be a very light moisturizer. Have not tried yet. Korean made products are reasonable and better than western made. 
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Magic Cream,"I don’t know what’s in this magic cream but I wake up with beautiful, glowy and supple skin. My skin type is oily and it does not clog my pores. I already stocked up on this."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,"No, not for me..","Good moisture but extremely sticky, more than a grip primer! Not like!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Saturday Skin Waterfall Glacier Water Cream - 50ml,I received this complimentary from Saturday Skin. The cream is light and weightless.

I love that it's a lighter feeling lotion that doesn't leave a greasy heavy  feel behind. Would recommend this product for sure!
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Total Hydration,"This is an excellent moisturizer! I have very dry and sensitive skin. It is difficult for me to find moisturizing creams that are hydrating enough to keep my skin moisturized and free of flakes and dry patches. This cream feels very cooling when applied. As it is massaged into the skin, you can feel the water in this cream. The formula is not very thick and it is easily rubbed into the skin. This cream is absorbed very quickly and it does not leave any residue on the skin. I like using this cream in the morning and evening. It wears well under makeup and it keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day, which keeps my foundation looking fresh and not cakey. After applying this product, my skin feels soothed and nourished. It immediately alleviates the my skin’s tight, itchy and dry feeling. My skin is visibly plumped up and radiant. I am very impressed with this product and I recommend it. I recieved this product complimentary from Saturday Skin."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Saturday Skin Waterfall Glacier Water Cream - 50ml,"Please note that I received this product complimentary from Saturday Skin in exchange for my honest review. I’ve really loved the lightweight gel consistency of this cream yet also how hydrating it is for my dry skin! It sinks into the skin beautifully but has been sufficiently moisturizing, especially during this dry season. Overall love the results from this cream!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Saturday Skin Waterfall Glacier Water Cream - 50ml,"Got this product complimentary from Saturday Skin.
This product is super awesome! First, the packaging attracts your attention. I love the holographic water drops on the lid and pastel pink container, Now for what is really important, the product inside.
 I am using it every day. It hydrates and moisturizes, leaving your skin dewy at first but then is absorbed beautifully into the skin means it absorbs super quick. My skin gets even more dry in the winter, but this works like a magic on my skin. It does not have a harsh smell but has a scent of something very light that I can’t place my finger on. This product also goes a long way, so use a little at a time as you don’t want to waste too much product putting it on.
I would definitely recommend this product, you must go for it!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Saturday Skin Waterfall Glacier Water Cream - 50ml,"This moisturizer is pleasant to use and I would definitely recommend for people with oily skin or who don't like the feel of a heavy moisturizer. I use it during the day and use a heavier cream at night. I looked up all of the ingredients through Paula's Choice and it only has one ingredient that could be potentialy sensitzing- Sodium Hydroxide. It is rated average, not poor. It gets 4 stars because most of the ""best"" rated ingredients are at the bottom of the list, indicatng they are not used at high concentrations. It has glycerin at the top of the list which is great. Overall, if I were to buy a new moisturizer I would pick something with more beneficial active ingredients. This is, however, still a great product with a nice formula."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Dream cream!!,"So for starters, I live in the middle of Wisconsin and the weather here right now is soo dry and cold. And my cheeks get SO red and patchy from it. This cream has really helped increase hydration levels in my skin and I feel like it’s helped reduce some of that redness. Would definitely recommend this :) this was gifted by Saturday Skin but I would repurchase this for sure"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Not good for dry skin,"I purchased this with the hopes that it would be a nice addition to my K Beauty 10 step routine, but unfortunately I was let down. I live in a dry/desert environment and my skin is extremely dry, to the point where my face will feel super tight. I usually use Belif’s Moisturizer Bomb which is AH-MAZING, but decided to give this moisturizer a try to switch things up. Don’t get me wrong: this is a GREAT lotion if you have normal, combination skin. HOWEVER, this is not moisturizing enough if you suffer from very dry skin. The moisture lasts maybe 2 hours, but then my face feels right again. I love the Saturday Skin line, but this wasn’t a win in my book."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Canada,overall great,"Great moisturizer for the hotter
 months gives bounce, hydrated skin but if you live somewhere to cold it might not be enough but I have a different winter moisturizer anyways ..."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Glass skin,"This product gives you perfect glass skin. I have very skin, sensitive skin. This has no harsh fragrance and keeps my skin feeling hydrated. I love this as my weekend pick me up to get myself feeling refreshed and healthy."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Singapore,Not bad,"Hydrating and make my skin very moisturizing. Not greasy at all, very suitable for oily skin like me. Suitable for summer wear as well. Doesn't cause any outbreak to my skin as well."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,water cream magic,Love this moisturizer! I have super oily/acne prone skin. I am also prone to redness and dry patches in the winter. This sinks in perfectly while keeping my skin feeling soft all day.  It’s so lightweight and I appreciate that this is not packed with fragrance! *chefs kiss*
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Amazing skin thirst quencher!!,"I looove this cream!! My skin is so dry that it looks dull, and it has caused my pores to open and enlarge, so finding a moisturizer that really hydrates my skin has been very difficult. This is the only moisturizer that my skin actually absorbs and is gentle on my sensitive skin!!! I'm so tired of applying moisturizers that just sit on my skin all day, and that you can literally scratch off at the end of the day! I tried The Indigo Cream Soothing Skin Protectant from Tatcha, and moisturizing-wise, this one did a lot better in that field. The Tatcha cream is also gentle on eczema/sensitive skin, so it wasn't a waste at all. This one just works a lot better at keeping the skin hydrated all day long. It works so well under my Clinique make up too! If you're skin is thirsty and sensitive, please give this one a try!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,it’s my favorite,"This stuff is fabulous!!! It’s feels great, moisturizes amazingly for dry skin, doesn’t overdo the oily parts of my skin. It’s an excellent product"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Canada,AMAZING FOR PEOPLE WITH DRY SKIN,I absolutely love this product BUT would only ever recommend it to people with dry skin as it is quite intense. Also I only suggest using this at night because it is tacky and I prefer letting it do its magic overnight. It’s a gel formula yet it is still a thick moisturizer.
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Canada,Very much enjoy this product,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I got this in my boxy charm, I can understand people that say that it’s sticky, that was my first impression when I put it on. Once I started to work it into my skin and let it dry, I was majorly impressed! This product left my skin moisturizer with a beautiful dew, I’m in love! If you’re someone who is looking for a product to moisturize before heavy makeup application maybe this isn’t the product for you because it’s not what I would call lightweight. Since I don’t wear foundation this worked perfectly for me. Definitely going to purchase one after mine is done."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Amazing for dry skin!,"This water cream has truly saved my skin. I am on my third container of this stuff. Yes it’s tacky, jelly and takes like an hour to soak in, I can see why some people find it uncomfortable. However, I have extremely dry skin and with other moisturizers my skin gets cracked, red, and irritated still. I use this about ever 4 days when my skin starts feeling dry and that’s about how long the moisture lasts. Which is honestly amazing to me that it lasts so long. It also really improved redness within a day. So if you have really dry skin and can put up with a little discomfort, this stuff is amazing."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Australia,LOVE THE GLOW,"I wasn’t too sure if I liked it at first, because it felt like I didn’t see a difference.. but after a weeks use, I have definitely seen a big difference. My face is more brighter, and glowy. I will definitely be re-purchasing again! "
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,The directions!?!,"I did not purchase this product; I received a sample. When i applied it I just squeezed the entire sample in my hands and began to work it into my face, neck, and décolleté. It seemed amazing...but then it turned into this super sticky and tacky film. Then I did what I neglected to do initially; I read the directions. I immediately realized that I applied too much product and shouldn’t have slathered it all over my face and neck. I saved the night by spraying a moisturizing toner to break up the stickiness. I give the product 3 stars because the instructions for how to apply are odd to me and I shouldn’t need such specific direction for how to apply a moisturizer. I like the gel texture but this product is a no for me."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Tacky but a nice facemask.,As many others mentioned I found it sticky and tacky. It dried on my face and left a film. I had to wash it off. I purchased off boxycharm and there info said to try it as a face mask. I didnt and it made my face very soft. A bit like Peter Thomas Roth gel face masks. So I'll use it that way but not purchase again.
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Saturday Skin Waterfall Glacier Water Cream - 50ml,"This is awful. Truly terrible. I don’t think I’ve ever hated a product this much. It is sticky and thick. It feels like you’re spreading a thick gel goopy glue across your face, and it doesn’t sink in or dry down. It stays sticky. This is the worst gel cream I’ve EVER tried. Absolutely horrid !"
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Saturday Skin Waterfall Glacier Water Cream - 50ml,I love it. It reminds me of Proactiv's Green Tea Moisturizer. It's not a heavy cream but more like a creamy gel. Doesn't give me that clogged pores feeling after I go outside in humidity like most other moisturizers do. I have dry skin and this is the type of moisture that I prefer. Not heavy to over compensate and not too light.
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Canada,A miss for me,"Featherweight was comfortable and light so I decided to give this a try thinking it would be creamier. I was wrong. This is a gel and it's tacky and I couldn't go to sleep with this tacky feeling on my face. I've had to wash it off because I did not feel comfortable with it. Like other reviews, it does feel like it just sits there. Does nothing for me."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Australia,Fabulous moisturiser,This is one of the best moisturisers I have ever used. So hydrating and no scent. It is a great texture and keeps skin hydrated for the whole day. A must try.
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Works as a primer,So as a moisturizer was a no go for me ... feels like it sit on top of the skin and leaves behind a tacky feel. But as a primer it works. Not bad but not great.
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,This is a pass,The name of the product is misleading. It’s a gel instead of a cream. This product didn’t really work for me. It never felt like it really absorbed into my skin. It sat on top leaving my skin slightly tacky. By the end of the day and sometimes halfway through I would have dry patches from the product never really moisturizing my face.
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Saturday Skin Waterfall Glacier Water Cream - 50ml,This moisturizer did absolutely nothing for my skin. It did not leave it hydrated one bit. Don’t waste your money!
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Canada,Saturday Skin Waterfall Glacier Water Cream - 50ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Received this as a sample and I was very happy with it! 

1) Colorless formulae - doesn’t leave any white cast or anything 
2) Scentless
3) Moisturizing enough to still able to feel it the next day I woke up
4) No break outs so far 
5) It does feel a tad sticky right after application but it goes away after a while. The stickiness doesn’t bother me that much."
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Malaysia,water moist,the packaging is lack of creativity and i am certainly not a fan for such a packaging. the moisturiser is certainly water based. it is definitely not greasy but it doesn't keeps my skin moist throughout the day.it works well for the 1st 2 to 3 hours though.
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,Amazing!,Absolute best cream I have ever used for my skin. Makes my skin look flawless and I swear I look more awake and younger when I wake up after using this. You will be so thankful that you bought this once you start using it!
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,Canada,pizza face,Ive never had a product break me out like this one. I went from having clear skin to looking like I did in 7th grade. I don’t reccomend this to anyone with acne.
SATURDAY SKIN-Waterfall Glacier Water Cream,USA,There are better moisturizers,"This product looks like a creamy gel but feels slick and sticky. After applying to skin it still feels tacky, doesn't feel like it absorbed much at all! Definitely not something I'd buy again though I love the cute pink jar package."
CHARLOTTE TILBURY-Refillable Magic Night Cream,Singapore,"Smelly, thick and sticky on the skin",My main issue with this cream is the texture and weird smell. It's so offputting I almost can't use it. I have oily/combo skin and this feels very heavy on the skin. I can live with this since its a pre-bedtime routine and no one is going to see my sticky face however I won't be buying again unless I see some miraculous results (especially for the hefty price point). Disappointed.
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,A must Have product delicious feeling!,"Clinique wrinkle correcting cream.
Got this product for free from Topbox. I used it a few times, and I really enjoyed very much the texture of the cream. Spread’s well, and you don’t need a lot of product to cover all face.
It’s a fragrance free, and no greasy to the touch, and it absorbs quickly.
You can notice an improvement in your face in a very short time, very happy.
I would definitely will buy the full size product. Thanks.

CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Not for me…,"I tried the Clinique wrinkle correcting cream for a few days during my morning and evening routine. The cream is very lightweight and easy to apply all of the face. It is important to note that there is a mild fragrance to the cream which I did not enjoy but it does fade quickly.

The cream feels moisturizing and absorbs into the skin really well. It is lightweight and fragrance free. I noticed in the morning that my skin felt hydrated and softer. It worked great for my dry skin. Haven’t noticed any changes to wrinkles as I feel like I need to use this a bit longer to fully see the results.
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Definitely worth a try!,"I received a deluxe size sample of the wrinkle correcting cream as a #freeproduct from Topbox. I used this every morning immediately after cleansing along with the wrinkle correcting eye cream and wrinkle correcting serum as part of my daily skin care routine.

As I have enjoyed using Clinique products in the past, I am considering purchasing this one."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,USA,Good product,I received this #freeproduct to #trywithtopbox and I enjoyed it. This cream was easy to apply and seemed to absorb fairly quickly into the skin. It was not sticky or uncomfortable feeling. I like to use it before bed to let it do it's job.

The Clinique smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting cream 5ml sample, love ,love this product.

Great feeling on skin when woke up in the morning."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Great for sealing in moisture!,This cream works well with other products from Clinique's Smart Clinical Repair line. I found that it was hydrating and helped to seal in moisture. I used it at night and my skin felt hydrated even after washing it away in the morning. The #freeproduct sample I received was a bit too small for me to be able to see any wrinkle fighting results.

My thoughts of this product are that it works incredibly well! Goes
On silky smooth, not overly greasy and is delicately scented. Upon applying to my skin the cool and refreshing cream was absorbed quickly and left no greasy residue. 

Over the last week I have included this product in my skincare regimen and have seen definite results and would absolutely buy a full size to continue the progress."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Soft & hydrated,I received this #freeproduct from #topboxcircle in exchange for my honest review. I received a small tube of this product to try out and was quite impressed even just using this for a few days. It was nice and thick but was able to cover my entire face with just a tiny dab of product. I liked that it is scent-free. My skin feels soft and hydrated.
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Absorbs well,I received a sample of this to #tryforfree so was only able use it on my face a couple of times because of the size of the sample. It absorbed really well onto the skin without making it feel oily. I like it a lot based on the few times that I used it. I could not see any immediate reductions in wrinkles after the limited number of uses but it did not irritate my skin and I like how my skin felt after application.
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,"#freeproduct After sampling this product during my nightly routine I can’t say I noticed a difference on my skin. I found this gel/cream a bit too gloopy and it isn’t the most pleasant to apply. Thankfully, it absorbs fast enough and doesn’t have any noticeable smell."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Great Cream,Got this cream as a #freeproduct from TopBox and I love it! It's unscented and super hydrating. I used it morning and night and loved the way it made my skin feel during the day. I've always been a fan of clinique products and this product is the holy grail. I will definitely purchase the full Suze and have already recommended it to friends and family.
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Not enough for an in depth review,I received this from Topbox in exchange for my honest review #freeproduct. I have to honestly say at first use I wasn't a fan at all. It felt really sticky and heavy on my fingers. It absorbed ok but I had to actually wash my hands after since the residue was unpleasant. This did abate somewhat and i continued to use. It was a small sample at 5ml so I can't give an accurate opinion on the wrinkle part. It did stay nicely on and absorbed fast. It had no unpleasant fragrance at all which is nice and expected for Clinique products.
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Hydrating,"I received a free sample from Topbox in exchange for my review. I’m a huge Clinique fan and was excited to give the Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting line a try. I wasn’t able to get much use out of the sample to comment on wether or not it is wrinkle correcting, but I was able to stretch the sample and use it both in the morning and evening for 2 days.  I  very much liked the eye cream as it was very thick (which is what I prefer) and had my eyes feeling super hydrated. #freeproduct"
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Too Expensive for me,"I I received this Smart Clinical Repair ""wrinkle correcting Cream #freeproduct from #Topbox in exchange for my honest review. This product has a thick texture and has no perfume scent which I like. It absorbed  quickly into my skin and left it feeling hydrated. My skin felt soft and motivated greasey. Unfortunately since it was just 1-2 uses due to a small sample, I'm not able to tell if overtime it would help with my wrinkles and fine lines. The price to way to expensive for me and I don't know if I could recommend it because I'm not able to continue to use it."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Best anti-aging cream,I been  using this wrinkle correcting cream and I find it's very moisturizing on my skin. I like that I don't need lots to apply on my face with little it goes long way. It's amazing how nicely it absorbed on my skin and leaving it so soft and smooth. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,very hydrating!,"I received a free sample of this product from Topbox  in exchange for my review #freeproduct . I can certainly say that the cream feels very luxurious and absorbs very well into the skin. It provides  long lasting hydration and is fragrance free. I has a thick creamy consistency, goes on very smoothly, and did not cause any irritation. Since it was a sample size I was only able to get 4 applications out of it and used it morning and night. It provides lots of hydration to the face but I cannot confirm that it reduces  the look of wrinkles as I was only able to use the product short-term."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,A great cream,After using this product I find my skin feels softer. I love how light the cream and the scent was good.  #freeproduct
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,fine as a moisturizer,"I was grateful to have received this #freeproduct from Topbox Circle in exchange for a review. I tried it a few times, but given that it is marketed as an anti-aging/wrinkle cream, this was not enough of a duration to adequately assess the products effectiveness to correct wrinkles. So I don't notice a difference at all, but that doesn't necessarily mean the product does not deliver on its claims. It works well enough as a moisturizer at night though so I will happily continue to use up the sample, regardless of whether it shows effective wrinkle reduction. (Also I don't think it will work on dynamic facial lines, but likely more basic small wrinkles). Texture was fine by me. And, though it is fragrance free it does have a slight smell that I wasn't particularly fond of."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Used a sample only,"I got a small sample size from TopBox Circle. It's a good hydrating cream that is unscented and didn't cause any irritations, but I'm giving it only 3 stars because I didn't see any specific improvement in the wrinkle or fine lines aspect. But again, I only had a small sample size so the testing period is short."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Fast absorbing and fragrance free,"As someone who is scent-sensitive and can be sensitive to breakouts, Smart Clinique Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream performed well on both of those fronts. It is fragrance free and did not cause any breakouts for me. It is fast-absorbing.. I have combination skin and will continue to use this day and night. I benefited from the long lasting moisturizing effect. I follow up my morning use with sunscreen . #freeproduct"
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Moisturizes well,"I received this “Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Corrrecting Cream” from CLINIQUE as a #freeproduct from #trywithtopbox for free in exchange for my honest review.

I have used the product a few times.
I really like the texture of the cream, it spreads well and it doesn't take much to cover the entire face. The product has no smell, and that's what I look for in cosmetics. In addition my skin is well hydrated with the product. Unfortunately, the cream leaves my face shiny and a bit greasy to the touch."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Really like this!,"I got this #freeproduct from #topboxcircle. Although the #freesample was small, it didn't take long to know this was a lovely product. It absorbs quickly, and there is a noticeable difference in a very short time. I would definitely try it again!"
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,I love this stuff!,"I received this as a sample from Topbox Canada. I have used to use the Dramatically Different moisturizer in the past, but as my skin has aged, I didn’t feel it gave me enough hydration. There is no question that the Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Cream gives me enough hydration! I started using it at bedtime. It made my skin feel velvet soft, and in I had no dryness in my skin when I woke up the next mornjng. I have also now tried it in the morning. It has kept my face feeling incredibly soft to touch, and moisturized all day.  My skin is very dry, and finding a product that keeps it feeling hydrated all day has not been easy. The cream is thick, but does not feel heavy once it is on. My skin is also very sensitive and prone to breakouts when I use a new product, and that hasn’t happened with this lotion. I love this! I will definitely be using this as my go to. #freeproduct"
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,"This was nice, but maybe not nice enough for the steep price tag (hard to decide as I only had enough to try it for 3 nights!) This was light, I almost wish it was thicker because it was hydrating but felt like it soaked into my skin and didn't leave enough moisture by morning. Regardless, the scent was minimal which is great and it didn't leave my skin feeling sticky or tacky. My skin drank this cream right up! Thank you to TopBox for sending it to me for free in exchange for my house review."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Clinique Smart Clinical Repair,"I received this product as a sample and was asked to provide my honest review.

CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Lovely cream,"I received this #FreeSample from #TopBox.

CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Real improvements on wrinkles and neck!,"I love Clinique products and this did not disappoint! I received this sample size of the product in exchange for an honest review. #freeproduct 
I used this product at night for 3 nights as I prefer to put creams on before bed. It absorbed into the skin well and did not leave any oily residue. I noticed an improvement on the smoothness of the skin on my neck especially. I also noticed a smoothing of my wrinkle/line I have across my forehead from raising my eyebrows all the time. Overall I think I would recommend and buy in the future."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,"I received the product as #freeproduct. I love this product as it is fragrance free, and it absorb quickly after application. Not greasy after application, and feel moisturised. I don’t see the effect of winkle reduction as I only used for short period of time, or I don’t have much winkle :) 
Overall I think this product is worth to try."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Decent Wrinkle Correcting Cream,"Thanks to Topbox Circle, I got to try a small sample of this winkle correcting cream for free. Please note that all of the opinions are my own and I am in no way sponsored. I have been using it for the past few days, and I have noticed some minor changes. My skin appears to be more hydrated than before. Unfortunately, I can’t really comment on whether it had helped with reducing lines and wrinkles as it has only been a few days. #FreeProduct #TryWithTopbox"
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,"#tryfreewithtopbox I got this as sample from topbox and I can say that even for just few times usage, it is very effective. Though I don’t have much wrinkles yet, i tried in on my neck which has very visible lines and it does lighten the lines. I would for sure recommend this product to my mom and put this on my list for future reference!"
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Great product!!,I had the opportunity to try this product for the first time and I was impressed.  I have extremely sensitive skin and this product did not irritate my skin and felt great.  I did find the smell a bit too strong but I'm extremely sensitive to that and was the only reason I've given 4 out of 5 stars.  My skin felt great afterwards and lines appeared less noticeable:)
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,from now on it will be part of my routine,"After using this product 2 times a day, my skin feels more hydrated and more uniform, I have loved this product"
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Lightweight Moisturizer,"I received a Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream sample from Topbox #freesample 
I have combination skin and have used this product over the span of a week, along with the eye cream and serum in the collection. I noticed immediately it was fragrance free. It was light weight. It has two ingredients I look for in creams as a 40 year old woman - peptides and hylaronic acid - to help with fine lines, moisturize and smooth my skin. Over the span of a week I did not see a huge difference. My skin did feel hydrated, felt soft & supple and I looked refreshed. It does not have SPF in it though, so in the morning I used a separate sunblock. I prefer to have my AM product include it."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,great,I got a sample of the product for free in return for a review. I really loved it. This has amazing ingredients and really made the skin around my eyes look great. There was not a strong smell and overall was great. I will purchase a full-size product.  I shared this with my mother and she found her eyes looked much better.
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Soft and plump skin!,"I have received a free deluxe sample of this cream from TopBox in exchange of my honest review #freeproduct 

The creamy, lightweight texture absorbs nicely into my skin leaving it soft, hydrated and plump without any greasy or sticky residue. 

I was able to get a few usages out of the sample pack since I find a small amount goes a long way, and I didn’t experience any irritation or clogged pores. This moisturizer is also fragrance free so perfect for sensitive skins. 

Overall it’s been a nice addition to my nighttime routine, and I would definitely be interested in purchasing the full size to see the long term results."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,"I love clinique product! Efficient, not too expensive and smell free! The texture of the product is really nice, not too rich but your skin feel moisturize after!"
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Try this for sure!,"Received this #freeproduct from #topboxcircle. It was a sample size so I had enough product to really try for about a week. What can I say? Clinique has been a family favourite brand for generations. All their products that I've tried have been home runs and this cream is no different. It feels light, not greasy and most importantly, it's fragrance free. I have combination skin and it works well with the dry areas and the T zone. I recommend this cream for sure!"
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,"Great cream, but…","#freeproduct #topbox
It’s a fragrance free product so I less appreciated it. Is great for sensitive skin. I appreciated the texture and feel. It’s not sticky and absorbed well. I didn’t observe effects due to the small quantity to be test. I did the test at night before sleep. Would need more quantity to try to make a solid judgment."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Love this Product! !,"I received this #freeproduct from #topbox.  I really enjoyed using it.  The cream feels silky and applies beautifully.  I found it hydrating, but not greasy and I enjoyed the very subtle scent.  I will be purchasing, as it has become a part of my daily skin care regimen."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Great ingredients for combating wrinkles,"Clinique might have a hit on their hands with this moisturizer. Peptides are fantastic ingredients in skincare and Clinique packs 6 of them into this moisturizer. It’s a white cream, that's not too thick, that I used both day and night. It absorbed quickly into my skin – with no break outs! It wasn’t sticky or left a film. It has no fragrance, which is a plus. My skin stayed moisturized during the day and night. I’d definitely recommend it! I received a sample of this moisturizer for review #freeproduct."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Great product,"I received this as a #freeproduct. I used this at night and during the day, and enjoyed how my skin felt moisturized when I woke up. This did cause my a bit of shine when I used it during the day, so if you have oily skin, it might not be the best. The product was fragrance free so it was definitely a bonus, and won't be irritating for those with sensitive skin."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Give it a try,"eceived a small sample to try & review from #trywithtopboxcircle #free which lasted to 3 uses.
I used this in the morning on face & neck , skin felt soft , helped smooth the skin,left skin looking radiant.I liked that it was Fragrance-free, Paraben-free, Phthalate-free, Oil-free, Free of synthetic colors as most companies are changing the formula to getting rid of these nasties. Unfortunately, wasn't able to see if it helped strengthen the skin as you need at least a month. Overall , seems like a good product with the results I got with the few uses."
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Lovely product!,"I really enjoyed this face cream. It was my favorite clinique cream I've used yet! I have combination yet sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin at all. It left my skin feeling smooth and it looked refreshed after using for several days.

CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Applies like a dream,"I received this as a sample size from #topboxcircle. The sample size was quite small & did not last long enough to see any wrinkle reduction. Typically you need at least 4 weeks to see improvement with that. However, I would definitely be interested in purchasing it to give it a fair shot. It has a very light fragrance, I am sometimes sensitive to fragrances, this did not bother me and the smell did not last either. The cream itself is very nice, goes on very smoothly & applies under makeup nicely. It did not cause any irritation to my sensitive skin either! It helped hydrate my skin, and I think it given long enough, it would work well at reducing wrinkles!"

CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Must have in collection,After using this product for the past two weeks I have noticed it really helped me in keeping my dry skin at bay especially around my eye. It really moisturize my skin. A little bit goes a long way and I usually use this during the night to add extra moisture for my dry akin . I use this both night and day . I love it but I believe you can find something better for the buck. Also you don’t get that much in the container. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct

I liked that this product was fragrance free, gentle and was very moisturizing. It was gentle and can be a nice addition to a skincare routine. I don’t know if there is any change as far as wrinkle repair in the short term.  This may be a product that needs to be used for a longer period of time to see results.  I don’t think I would be purchasing this product in the future as the results are not drastic enough for me to justify the price."

I used it only in the night and i Absolutely Loved It!!!!
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Solid Cream!,I received this cream as a free sample for my opinion. I used it every night and morning for a week. I liked how easily it absorbed into my skin and the mild scent was fine. I will say I did notice an improvement in my skin after the trial.

CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Scent free cream,I received a very small sample of this product complimentary from #trywithtopbox. I was only able to use it for a short time so I wasn’t able to see much results. I wish we received a bigger sample as it was quite small. I like that it was fragrance free and it didn’t cause any skin irritation. Another thing that I liked about this cream was that it was scent free. It was also paraben free. These are all the great aspects of the cream. It did make my skin feel hydrated. Again the only drawback was the amount of the sample.

This emollient has staying power feels dewy until the next day. I applied layers on my face and neck as a shield to ensure this penetrates deep and indeed the cream plumped my skin. The cream absolutely works by diminishing dryness and prevented any signs of dullness. It's moderately thick and is perfect for rough skin on neck, completely tightens. Clinique cream has a typical lotion scent that fades, it's not perfume scented. I applied the cream every night to allow repair advantage for it to work into my wrinkles, and my fine lines were minimized. Smart Clinical Repair protected the skin on my face and neck as a gentle barrier. #freeproduct"

CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Definitely need a bigger bottle!,"I recieved a sample of this product for free from Topbox to test and review. It was a small sample so not really enough to speak to long term results. But, that being said, it is certainly a product I enjoyed using and will be purchasing a larger size of. The first thing I like about it is that it is scent free. While I don't normally mind scented products, I know many people that do so this makes this cream much more inclusive. It has a beautiful absorption rate. It literally soaks immediately into the skin and leaves so residue, it just feels soft and smooth and super nourished. I used it both at night after cleansing and in the morning as part of my normal prep routine. What I really loved was that it settles so quickly into the skin and it doesn't mess with anything that's put ontop of it. My makeup wore beautifully, just like it would over any of my more expensive moisturizers. I truly cannot wait to purchase the full size version of this product so I can really test to see if the long term wrinkle correcting promise it makes is true.

CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,This was a  #freeproduct that I received  from #trywithtopbox. . it was small in size so i tried it only for a few days . The Cream is very moisturising as whole and i liked the feel of it on my face . I feel over time it should help correct the wrinkles as well but i definitely saw some smoothness the next day
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Smooth and pleasant cream,"I received a small sample of this product from #trywithtopbox in exchange for a review. I was able to get three decent sized applications out of it, which unfortunately isn’t enough to get a thorough understanding of what this product is capable of. It was not overly scented and absorbed well. My skin did feel more hydrated but without a larger size I cannot speak to any of the claims the product makes. It seems like a lovely product and didn’t have any facial irritation after two days but not sure if I’d buy it based on this experience. Would need a more thorough try to make a solid judgment."

CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Hydrating,I like the cream very moisturizing. It absorbs very quickly. Very Hydrating and moisturizing. Doesn't feel sticky.#trywithtopbox #freeproduct
CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,Smooth and soft,"Nice and smooth feeling during and after application. Goes under makeup ok but I wouldn’t rely on it for a moisturizer for very dry skin. Wrinkles seemed a little less defined, skin felt softer, I believe it plumped and smoothed a bit while avoiding shininess. 
I’m usually sensitive to some products but this was fine for my skin. No breakouts or clogged pores, I usually paired it with a primer for full coverage. Would recommend to others, it’s not a miracle but helps with some smoothing of the skin. 
Thank you for the chance to try."

CLINIQUE-Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream,Canada,very hydrating,"I received this product from Topbox for free to try #freeproduct.  I was able to get  4 applications out of the product and  used it for 2 days ( morning and evening).  The texture is super creamy and non-scented which I love. My skin felt extremely hydrated and supple after using the product for 2 days.  It also did not feel sticky or oily and seemed to absorb very well into my skin. However, I am unable to confirm or deny that the product reduces/corrects the appearance of wrinkles as the sample size was not large enough to test for an extended period of time in order to see results."
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,Singapore,good,Repeat purchase. I love love Love this product. It is not oily and moisturise the skin reaaaaaallyyyy well. Feels good on my dry skin. Goes well under make-up toooooo. 
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,Singapore,love this,This is so under rated. Lovely scent and locks in the moisture very well. Seriously doesn’t get enough credit for a ceremide cream. Closest competitor is probably dr Jart ceremidin. Texture is more moisturising for sure
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,Singapore,pink,"When applied to freshly-cleansed skin, pretty much any gel cream will sink on in. So for me, the real test of a water cream's disappearing act is when applied over a serum or oil. This one absorbed completely"
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,Australia,really nice ,I love this cream. Light scent of rose is nice. Feels amazing on my dry skin and makeup compatible. Adore the metal tube. It is not greasy. Glides on well and a joy to use. 
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,Malaysia,Beautiful,"My skin is dry with visible fine lines, dull, feels tight and weaker barrier but thanks to Pixi Rose Ceramide Cream for treating my skin with well. I’ve used this cream for almost a month and I can tell you that my fine lines are less less less visible 😱 My skin feel soft, radiant and hydrated. I am satisfied with the result and of course will repurchase. This cream is Holy grail for people with dry skin!!! For those who have sensitive skin, I don’t recommend this due to the fragrance and it’s quite strong, but I’m glad my skin can accept it. You may need to patch test first. 5 stars for keeping your promise Pixi! ❤️"
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,Australia,Fine ,This product was just fine. It did exactly as expected but wouldn’t purchase again. There are cheaper products that do a the same/better on the market. 
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,Australia,Fantastic hydrating primer!,Purchased to use as a primer and it works beautifully! A little goes a long way and the scent is spot on. Packaged well so great for when traveling! Love it xo
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,Malaysia,Pixi Love!,Love this moisturizing cream. Not too heavy and neither too light. Not for you if you are looking for something super light on the skin. I use it twice - morning n evening - and works perfectly for me.Lost count of the number of tubes I have used already!
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,Singapore,"love it, my everyday cream","This is my second time purchase. And it’s perfect for my skin. I use it everyday and night. Not too oily and it keeps my skin hydrated. Especially I love the smell, just feel so relaxed. I highly recommended!!
"
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,Malaysia,Velvet,This is my daily base before makeup. I have bought it multiple time and always stock it up. You need a small amount and it spreads very well. Makeup goes on very well on it.
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,Malaysia,1 of my fav product,"pixi 1 of my favorite products, it always have rose smell in most of it products, and i love the rose and smell, so far i tried the rose flash balm it was alright so see how on this, i read reviews they said it thick."
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,Not for me ,"I have a combination skin type. 
The cream is thick. 
I feel like it makes my skin feel more oily instead of hydrating/moisturizing. 
Since the consistency of it is thick, i recommend using it at night instead. "
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,Not bad. ,This ceramide cream works fine for those with dry skin. Keeps my skin hydrated throughout most of the day. Will definitely recommend. Price is reasonable as well. The only thing I don’t like is the tube package as it’s hard to get the last content out when it’s about to finish. 
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,Mrs,This product is amazing! My skin feels so smooth. I used it day and night after my serum. I highly recommend this product. Not oily and it smells good as well. 
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,good,"I have always love this product. I always went for a glow look when I apply this cream 
before my makeup. This helps a lot. Quite affordable as well. Easily to apply. Definitely recommend!

"
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,"An ""OK"" moisturizer","I don't like the aluminium tube packaging very much, it's always difficult to get the last bit of product out when it's almost finished. Talking about the product inside, it does have a much lighter texture than I've expected, it absorbs into the skin quickly, and has lovely smell. But it is a bit too watery for me and my face start to get dry again in a few hours. The formula also caused a bit of a problem if I apply a little more than usual before makeup."
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,Not so good,"This product is not very suitable for people with dry skin. Although the price point is rather reasonable and in fact, cheaper, the product quality isn't that great overall."
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,Best Moisturizer Ever!,"I have oily but dehydrated skin so I've been looking for something to lock in the hydration and also provide moisture and this Pixi one is amazing for it. It smells like roses and something citrusy so it's very refreshing. Although it took some time to sink into the skin, it doesn't leave a greasy feeling when it finally sunk."
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,Thick moisturiser ,Still testing this out. It's very thick so we only need very little. Otherwise it makes the face oily. Can bit used both day and night routine. Nice scent. Apart from these nothing special. Most likely would not repurchase. 
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,Thick.,"I think they should call this ceramic cream instead but the consistency is thick! Works great as a night cream but will not recommend for day time use due to the rich and thick consistency. Does it work? Yes. Totally. Your skin will feel like the inside of a rose and since there are ceramides, your skin barrier will feel that way too. Best to use a collagen serum and then put this. You will feel beautiful the next morning...until you get ready for work. Especially on a Monday.

"
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,Glow !! ,"At this age, i started to invest on skincare. The first purchase of all pixi skintreat. Was quite shocked , this ceramide cream makes my face glowing even after i woke up. Doesnt make my skin dry anymore. Those with dryskin , you should try this holy grail thingy ! No regrets & will repurchased it again & again.. "
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,PIXI  Rose Ceramide Cream,"The product smells nice with a light scented rose fragrance.
It does not really moisturize the skin. There is no improvement or worsening of the skin though. "

Its smell nice, and i use it as a mosturiser daily, in days where i feel dry for my skin, i put more and double it up as a hydrating mask.... great product"
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,A good night cream ,"A thick, creamy cream for night time use. I rotate this on nights I don’t want to use the Rose Oil. My skin feels soft in the morning and the smell is so good at night. I don’t use this during the day. "
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,soft cream,"a very soft cream, not too heavy, not too light. right in the middle. for someone with oily skin, might not like this. my face do get oily at noon due to sweat. however, amazing to use overnight. woke up with a smooth skin. hydrated and smooth. "
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,Perfect for dry skin,"If you're suffering from dry and dehydrated skin, this is your life savour! I brought this with me to Norway where harsh cold weather hit me every time I headed out and heater suck out all my moisture when I was indoor.  "
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,good,a little of this goes a longggg way. just a pea sized amount is enough. i use this as a day face cream as i have very dry skin. wouldnt advice those with oily skin to use this.
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,PIXI Rose Ceramide Cream ,"Product smells a little citrusy, much prefer the old pixie Rose flash balm.

Not as moisturising as I expected it to be. 

Texture  is more watery than creamy as the name suggested."
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,the cream is great but the packaging isn’t ,"I love the smell of the rose as well as the ceramide cream. However, the package was like the old school toothpaste tube and they are bad when it comes to traveling. It leaks, and the tube will tear. I have to dispose it before I finish the tube :("
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,Amazing! - Normal to dry skin,"I have normal to dry skin. This cream absolutely works wonder into deep of my skin. I love to apply this cream on night right before bedtime because the texture quite heavy (take sometime to absorb)but really moisturising. I feel great everytime I woke up on the next morning. It’s really makes my skin smooth. This is my first using Ceramide cream and I felt in love! One more, the scent really calms me! Loveeeee"
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,Mrs,"Not suitable for oily skin, it makes my face very greasy and doesn't help to calm down redness. I'm using it as hand cream now lol. 
People with dry skin may like it though."
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,So far so good ,"I like the refreshing feeling on my skin and the gel like consistency. I sleep in air conditioned room and by the morning, my face still feels moisturised and did not produce a lot of oil like how the Clinique’s moisture surge does for me! Love it but will give it more try before I update again. "
PIXI-Rose Ceramide Cream,,Ms,Not good for sensitive skin as my face gets red in first few minutes after application of this ceramide cream. also not good if you hav oily skin as I realised my face gets more oily at the end of the day when i use this in the morning. 
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Not for blackhead prone skin!,"I had a very small trial size of this, and chose to use it as a potential night cream. The size was so small that even using a tiny amount only once per day, I probably only had 2 weeks worth. The first thing I noticed was that the smell was very distracting. It's a clean smell but not necessarily medicinal, and I noticed it for quite a long time after applying. The real issue I noticed a couple of days later. I have combination skin, and this contributed to a huge increase in blackheads. Even on parts of my face where I don't typically get any acne at all like my cheeks and my neck. I don't know how to start on what it did to my poor forehead. Suffice to say the removal strip I used looked like a map of the Swiss Alps. This as my night moisturizer was the only change I made, and I was moving from Sunday Riley's CEO moisturizer (which I love) to this. All in all, I used it for about 6 days before tossing the trial size."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Don't use if you have remotely sensitive skin...,"I usually never write reviews but I had to... when I first started using this product (first 3 days) I was in love! I thought I had found my moisturizer! The glow, the scent, the ingredients, all AMAZING! Until the first week had gone by... my whole entire face broke out in milia :) I've never experienced this before. I do have sensitive skin and am cautious of what I put on my face, but given that this product claims it is for sensitive skin, I gave it a go. I've used other Sunday Riley products in the past with zero problems, but the results with this are horrifying. My entire forehead and neck are currently covered in bumps. Since then I've had to stop using."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,Singapore,So so,"A normal moisturizer with a high price. Not worthy for it... I'm not in it cause its fragrance (almond icecream?) But at least it did what the intro details showed, so 3.5 star for this."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Saves my super dry skin,"This is my savior nightcream. I have extremely dry skin and this leaves my skin feeling bouncy and soft when I wake up in the morning.

It is very thick and very intense moisturizer so I wouldn't recommend it for day time use. Unless you don't plan on applying any makeup products on top of it."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,yes you want it!,So thick and creamy and feels like it truly locks in moisture! I live in CO where it’s extremely dry - finally feel like all of my dry patches are gone! My only complaint is this seems like it’s only going to last me two full months (using in Am and PM) - I might find something cheaper to use in the morning that has sunscreen in it instead.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,Malaysia,Playdoh smell,"I read some of the reviews before deciding to give it a try even though the reviews were really mixed. First thing i notice is the playdoh alike smell that is quite unplesant. When i applied it on my face and started rubbing it, it feels like there are tiny scrub beads that scrubs on my face and it actually stings if i rub a bit harder. Is it so weird. I love the Sunday Riley serums and they work wonders, but this cream Is definitely a NO from me. "
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,"a night cream only, very thick","Very thick, almost hard to spread on face.  Not a great scent, I can't see buying, especially for the money! but tried the sample.  Would not recommend for young skin or with acne.  I have mature skin and trying it as a night cream, hopefully skin will be nice in the morning!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Spreads amazingly,"This cream may not smell amazing, but it’s tolerable and so far is my favorite. I’ve tried many creams, from too soft to too heavy. This cream works well for me. It’s so easy to spread, so I only use a small amount each time. I feel like this cream will last me a long time."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Clogged and irritated my normal skin,"This caused tiny pimples and a lot of irritation around my eyes and cheeks within a week. At first, I thought something else must be causing this, but after reading other reviews, realized it was the thickness of this cream that must have caused ""milia"". Stopped using this, gently exfoliated those areas to remove buildup, and used a lightweight soothing moisturizer to repair the damage. Returned this product."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Dry Skin Heaven!,"ICE is the only moisturizer I'll now buy. it's perfect. Definitely makes skin baby soft--noticeable difference. And, I can't describe the heavenly smell. It smells like ice--not a fragrance, though, which I would be allergic to. Don't be put off by the price. A little bit goes a long way. I use it in the summer, too, but most of you would love it for winter or a nighttime cream. I have super dry skin."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,"I love this cream so far. It’s very thick and a little goes a long way. I love that it’s thick because I have dry skin..and it absorbs really well too. The scent was kind of strange at first, but honestly love it how. It doesn’t have fragrance so it smells more natural and “weird” I guess. If you’re picky about smells do not get it, :)"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,This is one of the best ceramide filled moisturizer on the market. I started using this as a winter moisturizer but as another year went by I realized I kept getting drier. I had gotten micro needling treatment and just could NOT seem to fight the dryness. Well I pulled this out of my arsenal of products and it’s the only thing that did the job. So now this is def in my summer routine as well. Go feel this for urself especially if u r in the over 50 age or just have extreme dryness that nothing helps
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,"This is my first time ever writing a review for a product. Received ICE with the Sunday Riley night time kit. The smell repulsive and horrible I ended up throwing. To me it smells like play dog mixed with mildew. Who knows, maybe I got a bad batch but I will not buy again, not worth ever smelling that stench."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SAVED MY SKIN,"This moisturizer is a must have if you have very dry skin or use retinol in your skincare routine. My skin barrier was completely ruined when I started using prescribed tretinoin a couple weeks ago. None of my moisturizers were ever able to moisturize my skin from the flaking I was going through, except for this. It completely changed my skin even after the first application. My skin doesn’t even get tight or dry after washing my face. My skin looks so much healthier and the redness I used to have on my cheekbone area has vanished.
It does leave a very dewy, non-greasy, finish so I prefer to use it at night. 

It does have a strong scent that stays on for a while after application. To me it smells like candy and play doh. It doesn’t smell bad but if you don’t like fragrance in your skincare it might bother you."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,"Lovely, thick cream that hydrates and moisturizes my combination/dry skin. Especially good in the cold, dry North East winters."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Magical Cream,absolutely love Sunday Riley products. This lotion is packed full of nutrients to smooth and soften your skin. I love it as a night time cream but also great for daytime if you need an extra booste.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Not for Me,"I was using the Drunk Elephant Protini and I wanted something more moisturizing since I use a retinol under and I decided to go with this. Ok I have to agree with the other reviews the smell/fragrance literally makes me nauseous, it’s so overpowering. I can’t even figure what the scent is suppose to be, it’s just awful. Then the first use made me break out all over. I have combo skin and haven’t had an pimples since I was a teen. I decided to just wait and try again and it made my skin react worse. Waste of money will not buy again. I won’t even finish it. Maybe I will use on my feet? Do not recommend."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,"Too heavy, too greasy, too much fragragrance!","I can't get over the strong, sugary/sweet fragrance in this moisturizer. It lingers and is awful! This is also WAY too heavy and thick for my skin. I started breaking out within 2 days of use. It's hard to rub in and get it to absorb no matter how little you use."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,It’s a 10/10 from me,"I started using this product a couple of weeks ago and I can already feel a significant difference in my skin. It feels softer, more hydrated, and definitely more plump/juicy than before."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,I’m sold - this stuff is AMAZING!,Best face cream I’ve ever used. I love in CO (very dry climate) & am 51.   This cream moisturizes better than any product I’ve ever used - I apply AM & PM. Is great under make-up too. Smells yummy. Best new skincare product I’ve found in a long time.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,"Ugh, I LOVE this cream! As someone with normal to dry skin that lives in the desert, this is perfect for me. It’s so thick and dreamy and leaves my skin feeling plump and juicy and protected. And it smells like delicious almonds with a slight coconut touch (all natural fragrances). I love that it contains ceramides! Highly recommend for those that love a super luxe cream."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SMELLS BAD,I can’t use this because of how bad it smells! Normally I am able to push through but with this product I just couldn’t! Thank god it was just a mini size!
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,BREAKOUT CITY,I really wanted to like this product. It made me break out really bad! Tiny pimples everywhere! I never break out at all. Yes it leaves skin soft and plump but at what price? Acne all over my chin and forehead. It looks bad. Please don’t buy this. I’m returning mine.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Not for acne prone skin,"As others have mentioned, this moisturizer broke me out like crazy. At first i wasn’t sure if this product was the cause, so i stopped using it until I’d finished up some others. I tried this again and the same thing happened, numerous tiny breakouts, seemingly permanent large pores, and a few really big and deep breakouts. I am hoping I can return this. If you are even remotely acne prone, i would stay far away."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Terrible,Worst product! I was using this product for 1 week and all of a sudden my skin has broken out in small red bumps and itches like crazy. The bumps have spread all over my face and down my neck. I have never experienced this with a product that claims to be for sensitive skin.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,DO NOT RECOMMEND - PORE CLOGGING,I was really excited to try this cream - it has decent list of ceramides. What else it has? WAX. This cream clogged my pores so badly just in a few days (less than a week!). My face got covered with tiny little bumps. I ditched the cream and they were gone in a couple of weeks. DO NOT RECOMMEND.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Look younger with one jar!,"By far, a life saver for aging skin. Not once, but twice I was told by friends my skin looked flawless. I’m turning 60 and you would not know it. This is a facelift in a jar. Don’t ponder, researched anymore. This is the stuff and you only need a little to cover your face."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Nothing else compares!,"I bought a Sunday Riley special delivery kit and it had a small tub of Ice in it. I’ve used the kit for less than a month and my face is so soft now, I’m not even sure that it’s made of human skin anymore. 10/10 addicted to Ice (the moisturizer, not the drug)"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Definitely not for sensitive skin!,"I give 2 stars because I was initially excited about all the ceramides and ingredients but holy guac, after about a week of using this daily my sensitive skin got bright red and hot! My opinion is probably a reaction to one of the many extracts that, again, imo are unnecessary in the first place. Do not recommend for sensitive skin and wish I hadn’t thrown away the receipt so I could return. It’s not cheap!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Face broke out with milia from product,I broke out all over my face in small bumps and I was not sure if this product was the cause until I suggested it to my sister (before I broke out) and she had the exact same reaction all over her face. Some milia bumps all over
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,It’s a great night cream. I love the smell and the way it feels on my skin. It’s one of my favorites moisturizers of all time. I’ve gone through three of them.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Not for sensitive skin,It made my skin red and sting the first time I used it.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,Great product…not sure if it’s good for aging skin and wrinkles. Not sure about smell
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Great for Dry Winter Skin,"Very thick but smooth gliding cream. It smells sweet - vaguely like cherry vanilla (very gentle scent) which is so pleasant and relaxing. (I actually wish they made a body lotion or body oil with this soft scent.) I have extremely dry skin which develops patches of dryness, flakes, redness, and rosacea in winter, especially around cheeks. This has prevented that. Usually I need to use a humidifier at night to make my skin more moist in winter but this year I didn’t! So to me that’s clear effectiveness. I use a decent scoop of this (it comes with a beauty spatula to prevent touching it with fingers) but if you aren’t nearly as dry as me, you’ll definitely use less. Even with my massive scoops, I’ve had it for a month and it’s only 1/3 gone. Bonus: It does not cause pilling when I put my mineral SPF on."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,This product does feel so rich and nice but it tends to make my face heat up and get red. It was not a hit for me personally but I would just be cautious to try it especially considering the price. I would recommend getting a sample first and trying it out
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,I was told this lotion was for sensitive skin and my face started getting little pimple look alike . My face has never been this bad. It only took two days to do the damage
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,In love,"For reference, I have oily, acne rosacea prone skin that I've managed pretty well these past few years with minimal breakouts. My skin LOVES this stuff, I haven't noticed any related breakouts and this stuff's so thick and perfect for winter time. my skin despite being oily felt dehydrated and this stuff is great for that"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,Love this moisturizer. Thick and hydrating but never leaves residue like others of its kind. The smell also reminds me of vacation for some reason and doesn’t make me break out. Love Sunday Riley products!
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,buy it!!!,Best moisturizer out there!! Love Sunday Riley products! They have truly transformed my skin
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Heaven on earth,My favorite moisturizer by far! A little goes a very long way so it lasts for a really long time but as soon as I’m getting low on the product I have to make sure to go by another one so I don’t run out. It’s thick but light on the skin and has a pleasant smell. It’s literally my holy grail!
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Permanent Addition to my Skincare Routine,"I rarely write reviews but this is by far one of my favorites. I have dry/combo/sensitive skin and this cream has been a dream come true. My night time routine has been Hyaluronic Acid (first), Sunday Riley Ice, and Biossance Squalane + Vitamin C Rose Oil (last). I don’t wear make up often (if I do I use Saie Slip Tint Moisturizer) and receive sooooo many compliments on my skin. Honestly the perfect addition to nighttime routine for combo/dry skin!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,PERFECT winter cream - please never discontinue,"My partner and I are both obsessed with this moisturizer - and we’ve tested so many that didn’t perfectly provide the winter hydration we need (Drunk Elephant Water Facial, True Botanicals, MAKE, etc) This does, especially when our heater is drying out our skin. It’s smoothing, plumping, you wake up with the softest skin ever. And I’m in love with the texture and smell - it’s soft and sweet. I actually didn’t like this cream when I got it a year ago, but started using it again when my skin was flaky and I had dry patches out of nowhere. My gel-creams weren’t doing it for me, and this fixed my flaky issue overnight. 

It’s thick, so a little goes a long way, but it really melts into your skin and STAYS put, unlike some other thick creams that sit on your skin like a film or somehow dry out like it was a gel-cream. I especially like layering ICE when I’m using an acid might serum, since it locks in moisture and I don’t wake up dry. If you’re using retinols, this is a good choice to moisturize with too."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Very moisturizing,"I purchased this a few months ago and have been using it daily, it really hydrates my face and even though it has a thick texture it doesn't have that long term sticky feeling that some moisturizers have. It is a little sticky and feels a little heavy at first but it absorbs and leaves your face with a lovely glow to it. I also love how well it keeps my face moisturized throughout the day, some moisturizers leave your face dry throughout the day and only moisturize it for a short period after you apply it."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,Huge SR fan and have loved this moisturizer since it’s came out and have purchased multiple times. So hydrating and soaks in so well. I’m addicted.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,It goes on thick and moisturizes!,"I love this moisturizer because it’s heavy and therefore, perfect for my dry skin. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and moisturized. The texture is very thick, think margarine but it is not really icky greasy and you shouldn’t put it on your toast. It does leave my face looking dewy but I prefer that glassy skin and hydrated look. I use it morning and night! The only con is it is pricey. There is scent but I don’t mind it at all and it doesn’t last."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,Singapore,too thick to use during day but great for ac room,Very thick texture and I only use it when I am sleeping in an ac room. Wouldn't be able to use in humid day. Gives me nice smooth face the next morning. Smell is a little funky but tolerable. 
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Amazing,"The first time I tried this cream, it was so smooth and creamy it was like putting butter on my skin. The morning after I woke up I not only felt refreshed by skin felt the same. The smell never bothered me of coconut but I know for some people they prefer fragrance free. You will not be upset purchasing the product and one jar lasts me about 6 months since I only use it at night and I pair it with Sunday Riley’s Luna Oil."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Perfect winter dry skin product!!,"I love this moisturizer!! Absolutely perfect for dry skin during the winter. I get pimples when my skin gets too dry (no idea why) and used it twice a day every day. No more pimples! It’s a bit thick for summer, but still way better than tidal."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Good moisturizer!,Would like to start with I have extremely oily skin.  I liked that this cream didn’t make my face more greasy.  Dried fast.  Makeup wasn’t disturbed.  Would purchase and recommend!
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY,"Finally found a moisturizer I can honestly say I love. The cream is nice and thick. I have really dry skin and had been using shea butter, but I wanted something a little lighter. Got this as a sample and ended up buying full sized. I still have to use the shea butter at night, however I'm noticing that slowing there is no need for any other moisturizer. I do think the price is a little high, but its worth it in the end."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,This moisturizing cream is fantastic! I feel my skin soft and with a healthy glow. I use it as a facial daily routine to pamper myself. My skin feel fresh and rejuvenated. Amazing product!
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,"2 1/2 stars. I got a deluxe sample of this, and I like it, it makes my skin very glowy but this does NOT mix well with other products. I don’t know if it’s just me, but this is the only new product I added to my routine. It just balls up and rubs off."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Luxe,This works so well for me. Very soothing as soon as you apply. It’s rich and luxurious which makes it perfect for night time. I think it smells like frosting without being overpowering. This is now my third container and I will continue to rebuy.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,too thicc,Terrible! Too thick to spread on your face. Also the bottom of the container shattered and I realized how small the amount is they actually put in there. Not a good product.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Excellent product - terrible packaging,"I absolutely love this moisturizer.  I have been using it for a few months and this has been my favorite. The texture is a bit on the heavier side (not a gel-like consistency, more like a heavy whipping cream) and the smell is pleasant. (Similar to French vanilla ice cream.) I love the ingredient list - Ceramides, Squalene and Glycerin. If you have dry skin, this moisturizer is perfect for you. Due to the ceramide content, it locks in moisture into your skin. I feel like the moisturizer gave my face an instant glow. 

While I love how the moisturizer works, I have to point out one major flaw: the jar. The jar gives an illusion that it is holding more product but it is not. While Sunday Riley claims to be a sustainable company, how is it sustainable to utilize such a thicker jar for their moisturizer? They need to rethink how they package their products if they truly want to be a more sustainable company."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Holy grail winter moisturizer,"This is absolutely perfect for my winter skin!  My skin is oily, but very prone to dehydration in the colder and less humid months.  At first I found this to be VERY heavy, because it is.  But after a two or so days my skin started to drink it up and it's been SO glowy and plump!  I don't think this is something I could use in the summer, except maybe at night, but I will absolutely be purchasing this once winter comes around again!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Needed this in the winter!,"My skin has gnne from normal to dry (complete with flakes) within this winter. Other ""rich creams"" were not (Tatcha Dewy, Secret Sauce, etc.) This should be labeled extra rich cream.I finally have something that will keep me hydrated throughout the day without having to reapply moisturizer. I feel my skin can actually heal.

As to the texture and smell, if you are familiar with Burt's Bees Almond and Milk Hand Cream, the smell is exactly like that, and the texture is just a slightly lighter version of that."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Bumps on my face after application,"I received it as a sample. Only with single application I have bumps all over my face. I stopped using it but not too sure whether the bumps are because of the cream. I tested again after about 3 months and same as before, only after one time application I had the same problem. I didn’t have such problem with other brands. I don’t have sensitive skin."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,Smells great and feels refreshing and smooth on the face! It is a mildly thick cream but it melts into the skin pretty quickly. It has a slight scent to it. The only reason I don’t give it 5 stars is because I wouldn’t recommend it in summer. It doesn’t mix well with sweat. For a fall and winter moisturizer I think it’s great!
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Great cream for the winter months when your skin n,"Cream is thick. Smells a little like CocoaButter, not my fav scent but not too strong. I do like it. My skin felt a bit greasy after using it the first few weeks every day twice a day so I started using it only once a day as I was afraid of clogging my pores. Great cream for the winter months when your skin needs more moisture"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,holy grail moisturizer for tretinoin users!,"I use prescription tretinoin for anti aging and acne purposes, which as any user of tret knows can often cause flaky, sensitive, dry skin when acclimating to it or switching to a new strength.

Sunday Riley Ice makes it a total non issue. I use this at night and apply it after cleansing and toning (7 skins method with pixi milky toner). I let it absorb for about 30 minutes then apply my tret right on top. No dryness, no sensitivity, no flakes - just baby soft, glowing clear skin. I struggled majorly with tret on my sensitive skin before I found this moisturizer, but Ice changed everything! 

I cycle between ice at night and ceo cream for day."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,"I’m a huge fan of Sunday Riley and love this cream!! I suffer from dry skin and this has worked wonders. I use this with the A+, the vitamin C and good genes.  Switched to this when tide was not around for quarantine."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,"I didn’t want to like this because it’s so expensive, but it’s seriously amazing. I got it as a sample in an order and fell in love with how thick it was, I just had to buy the whole thing."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,Great product! I struggle with dry skin this time of the year. Typically I use a lighter moisturizing gel. But the cream works excellent. It’s helped me out tremendously and will most likely repurchase
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,possible dupe for La Mer?,"I liked this face cream.. I live in colorado where it’s super dry and feel like this does a great job at night moisturizing. You definitely can’t use too much or else it will feel heavy as it is a pretty dense cream. 

I was told by the Sunday Riley spokesperson in the store that this was developed to parallel / maybe be a dupe for the La Mer cream, but I haven’t used that so I can’t say for myself. All I know is that it’s half the price of La Mer although it is still pricey. It lasted me about 3-4 months I’d say"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,BUMPS EVERYWHERE,"After the first application I woke up and had bumps everywhere and I usually don’t react like that to new moisturizers. Thought it might be stress so tried it one more night and it just got worse. Everything puffy, bumps all over, and just painful. Returned immediately and went back to Drunk Elephant polypeptide moisturizer."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,"wanted to love, but...","I was hoping to like this so bad with my dry/combo skin but man... it was so thick and it felt like it just sat on top of my skin. I only used it at night, after a double cleanse and my tatcha plumping serum. I really needed something to help soothe and repair my skin, but man this stuff just... it was mediocre. It smells strong, and although I like the smell, my skin doesn’t do well with fragrance. My skin could probably get used to it eventually, as it does with most products, but it felt like it was irritating my breakouts as opposed to helping them."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,"refresh, recharge",I’m not really sure where all the bad reviews for this product is coming from. I’m a huge Sunday Riley fan and this face moisturizer is my favorite from the line this far! It’s super thick in consistency so I don’t recommend if you have oily skin but works wonders for those looking for brightness and a cure to dullness. It all leaves a refreshing kind of feel after using.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,lackluster,"Overall, I never use this product anymore. I'm not sure why, but it isn't appealing to me. I ended up purchasing something else shortly after."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Amazing moisture,"The moisturizing creams amazing, makes my face very soft. Easy to use my skin feels vibrant"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,could not love it more,I am 48 years old and I have combination to normal skin. I don’t think I have ever finished a tube or jar of moisturizer in my life. I’ve never found one that I really liked and I’m always onto the next product. I’ve hit the bottom in three jars of this so far. I use it as a night cream and I’ve absolutely fallen in love. A lot of other creams clog my pores but this one does not yet I wake up with my skin feeling absolutely magnificent. It’s too heavy for me during the day but it makes the best night cream in the world!
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Rich moisture without clogs,"My skin is constantly dehydrated but clogs easily. I'm always looking for a rich moisturizer that doesn't have silicones or heavy butter, which clog my skin. This moisturizer is perfect. It sinks in beautifully and gives me lasting moisture and plumpness. It's a little heavy in the summer, so I mostly use it in the fall and winter. It has a rich texture and a slightly fruity scent."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Sensitive skin loves this product!,"Absolutely love this! I was using a First aid beauty cream for my sensitive skin due to face mask during covid and unfortunately, they discounted it. So I was advices to try this instead since it also contains ceramide. AND I FELL IN LOVE. It’s honestly the best. Runs on the thick side, but worth it for night routines!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Winter Skin Savior,"This is thick in a GOOD way, as in you fele like it is actually doing something! It absorbs, but you're left with that non-sticky hydrated feeling. Works fine under makeup if you give it time to sink in and there's little to no scent. If you've wrecked your skin with products like actives, this will protect and soothe and help you get back to better state. It might be too heavy for Summer, but in Winter it is a neccessity!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,I’m IN LOVE! Seriously one of my favorite moisturizers (second being tatcha dewy skin). I will say it is a very thick moisturizer but so great for extremely dry/flaky skin. It makes my skin feel like butter and I can honestly say my skin just looked a lot fresher and radiant too.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,try it you’ll love it.,I really love this product. It’s not oily or greasy. Works great with my combination skin. It’s also very lightweight and has a pleasant smell.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,Living in a little drier place this stuff was amazing super moisturizing and leaves me feeling refreshed. Caused my wife to have a little break out but she is super sensitive skin.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Ooh she a thicc bichë,"This was pure velvet on the skin. Yes it’s thick, so good to use if you’re very dry or as a rich night cream. Makes me feel like a rich old woman I aspire to be."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Smooth and Silky,"I liked this cream a lot! It plumped up my face a bit, giving it a nice youthful look! It helped with my dryness and left my face feeling soft and smooth, without over moisturizing my oily spots on the face. It's also a nice consistency, it's thick but it doesn't lay on your face or feel greasy at all. It gets soaked up pretty fast!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Love this product!,"I use this as my nighttime moisturizer, because it is thicker than my daytime. I wake up and my skin feels so hydrated! Definitely recommend this product!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,WORTH IT,This is a game changer along with Tidal cream. I have dull dry skin with no elasticity whatsoever before hitting 30. Always have. So far Sunday riley is it. The prices are painful but I have yet to find an alternative. Even tried 5 different drunk elephant products that were NO MATCH. I used this every night before bed and also during the day in place of other products to help my skin with moisture.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Ice Cremide Moisturizing Cream,"Absolutely love Ice Ceramide. Moisturizing cream, My skin has never felt so soft, I can't stop rubbing it myself.
Using Ice Cermide Moisturizing Cream Has Made Me Love My Skin Again."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Great product!,I live in the desert so my face can get really dry. I apply this moisturizer every night and before my makeup and it keeps my skin moisturized all day. I cant say enough about how this product has literally saved my skin!
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Milia Disaster,"Yikes. I had a sample size of this, so I thought I’d give it a try. It immediately caused a massive breakout of milia (tiny little bumps where skin cells have gotten stuck under a layer of skin) all over my entire face. I can see from other reviews here that a bunch of other people also had milia outbreaks from this moisturizer, so I’m somewhat skeptical of exactly how non-comedogenic it is. Needless to say, I will not be purchasing a full-size of this, and if anyone else who has had the same skin reaction is reading this, don’t worry: the bumps will disappear in a couple of days, especially if you lightly exfoliate."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Ice Ceramide cream,"This face cream is amazing. I loved using it everyday, it leaves my face soft and subtle. A must try."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Most amazing moisturizer.,This is an amazing moisturizer. It has a thick rich texture that will go smoothly over your skin. It leaves a silky smooth finish. I used it in the morning and before bed because I have a really dry face skin.  It also helped with the redness of my rosacea. I need this moisturizer in my life. Will buy it.  In love with it's hydration and it's pleasant smell.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Milia disaster,Milia disaster (little tiny bumps)  & clogged pores all over my face within 2 weeks of using this thing. I bought 50ml and what a waste of money.  Terrible experience. I’m definitely going back to my Murad moisturizer cream that never gave me these problems.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Great moisturizer,I really loved this moisturizer it really helped me immensely.I have really dry skin and it cracks really bad so this helped almost immediately
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,This product really helped clear up my dry skin to leave me feeling soft and smooth in all the places where it matters the most.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Necessity for dry skin!!!,"""Dry"" is an understatement to describe my skin. That being said, this has been a god sent. I was hesitant after reading reviews stating this isn't a good summer/morning moisturizer due to it being heavy (even for dry folks). However, I find it is perfect because of how dry I am. I admit it can feel heavy if you over apply, but I believe I've mastered applying just enough in the mornings where I'm hydrated but not sticky. At night, I apply SR Juno oil on top to seal it all in and my skin loves it-- I no longer wake up super dry!! Before buying this, my favorites were Tatcha's Dewy Skin Cream and the Adapotgen Cream from YTTP. (I loved both of these products, but Ice is just better.) In addition, my foundation sits on top of this really well! All of this to say, if you have really dry skin, this is a must have that's definitely worth the price tag. However, I would not recommend this to those with oily/combo/normal skintypes."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,"Amazing, but definitely thick!","I love the product, my skin looks and feels great! But it’s very very thick so if you’re not looking for that it’s not for you. Sometimes I mix it with a little CeraVe facial lotion and it lightens it up."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,Doesn't have an overwhelming scent but does have a slight one. I use this cream at night and it is so moisturizing (too much for my skin during the day). When I wake up my skin is so soft and hydrated. Worked so well during the cold and windy winter months.  Would definitely recommend.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,WE LOVE IT,"Okay WOW. I’m a licensed Esthetician and former sales rep for a huge skincare brand so to say I’m picky is an understatement. I needed something super thick because I upped my retinol and this was suggested to me. It has been a lifesaver. My skin was peeling and so angry and now it’s calm, glowing, and moisturized. I use this at night ONLY (she’s thick af) and by the time I do my morning routine and put my makeup on, my skin looks incredible. You barely need any so yes it’s pricey but it will last 6 months or more. Worth it. If you’re dry right now or using retinol, GET THIS."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,I wanted to really like this product but it’s too thick for my liking. My skin feels thick and greasy after going about my day. It’s very hydrating but just doesn’t work with my makeup/skin.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,"Perfect for dry, winter skin","As someone with dry skin the SUNDAY RILEY ICE Ceramide Moisturizing Cream seemed perfect for me. This cream is THICK but when my skin was irritated & extremely dried out during the colder months this moisturizer was my go-to. You really need to take the time to work it into the skin but I found that applying a facial oil or mist first made all the difference. This cream is best suited for dry skin as it does leave a more dewy finish but makeup applied beautifully on top. Now that it's summer time I've been applying this cream on my body, especially my legs, feet, & elbows."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,Great skin cream,"I used the Sunday Riley ICE Ceramide Moisturizing Cream and it really does work well.  It has a great feel, smells nice, has a great thick consistency, and is very moisturizing. I will definitely be purchasing this and I will tell friends too."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,Very cooling and calms my redness. Will be in constant rotation.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,USA,absolutely,"I don’t even know where to start on this one.
It smells sweet, almost powdery while not being overpowering. If you’ve ever had the White Cherry slushee at the movie theater… yesss just like that.
She’s thick. Like thiiiiiiiiccccccc (recommend this being the last step of your routine, unless you have heavy oils)
It will last you forever.
It will have a shiny/dewy/wet appearance if you use too much which I did a couple times on accident, and then have started doing it intentionally cause I like it and it helps for extra dryness under the mask.
When I can control myself and not use too much, it absorbs perfectly into the skin leaving behind only hydration and firmness.
I introduced her two weeks ago on my daytime and nighttime routines, and have not seen a negative reaction of my skin so props to them!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,Malaysia,Works,"Sunday Riley’s Ice Ceramide Moisturising Cream works to keep my dry skin continuously moisturised. I would definitely recommend this cream to anyone suffering from the occasional dry patches like I do (even whilst living in a tropical climate). I apply mainly at night. I’ve taken off half a star purely because I’m not a fan of coconut smelling skincare. Otherwise, would have been a definite repurchase item for me."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ice Ceramide Moisturizing Cream,Singapore,Doubtful product,"I’m a SR lover bit this is a disappointing product from the brand. No observed effects of ceramide after one jar.  I think drug store brand works better! Don’t know why my cream feels rough as if some particles inside. Also, ad photo shows the product is white but mine is yellow. Doubt the QA and won’t buy again. "
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Lotion,Australia,Great price point,It's a great price but the consistency and smell are not my favourite. Wouldn't re-purchase.
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Lotion,Singapore,good,Good product. Moisturising and does not feel oily or sticky. The price is also reasonable compared to other brands. Been wanting to explore other moisturisers but can’t seem let this one go
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Lotion,Singapore,good but not great,its a great starter product if you want to use retinol. however for the price point it does not deliver much
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Lotion,Malaysia,Good lotion,It smells good and it make my skin softer day after day. My skin becomes brighter as well and it doesn’t cause any breakouts. So far I’m loving this lotion and will repurchase 
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Lotion,Malaysia,So-so,"Like the title👆🏼, the product is just so-so. Doesn't do much for my skin. I don't know about others. I guess it will probably react differently to other ppl's skin. It's just not for me though. "
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Lotion,Singapore,ok as a lotion,"Ok product as a lotion for this price, but I really do not like the smell personally.
Not jasmine smell.
But it is quite hydrating.
I gave it to my husband to use, and he does not complain about the smell though, and he is quite happy to use it, loool
I think if u do not mind the smell, it is a ok product."
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Lotion,Malaysia,just so so,"bought this because i love jasmine products (despite every other product reviewer hating on fragrance). cannot beat their topseller the glycolic acid toner, but will try to finish the tube as a night cream. "
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Lotion,Singapore,Jasmine lottion,"Retinol Jamine Lottion!  Satisfied with the outcome of this lottion its made my face looks smoother, glowing and fresh. this is my 3 times purchase..."
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Lotion,Australia,Love this!,"I absolutely love the Pixi Retinol range! 
I have had issues with retinol in the past (I have really sensitive skin) but this range has been magic for my skin! It’s gentle yet super effective, it’s really smoothed out my skin without causing any redness or breakouts. "
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Lotion,Australia,Nice moisturising lotion ,"It is a decent moisturising lotion, the formula has a nice texture and feels light on the skin, can be worn under make up too with no problem however the scent is nothing like jasmine, it reminds me of lipgloss and vitamin e cream"
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Lotion Oil-Free Moisturiser,Malaysia,love this product ,Total in love with this product. definitely would repurchase this again. suitable for oily skin. would recommend this for those struggling with oily skin. 
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Lotion Oil-Free Moisturiser,Singapore,non oily and light gel moisturiser ,I love this range from Pixi! Have previously also tried the toner from the Clarity range and it’s great for my combination / oily skin especially in this tropical weather. This moisturiser is quickly absorbed into the skin and I use it everyday morning and night. I love it 
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,You will LOVE this!,"Ok… soooo! First of all Let me start off by saying.. I was skeptical about trying this firming cream but thank GOD I did. I know everyone’s skin is different and responds differently to products. But this right here worked sooo well for me, my skin felt firmer , tighter, and I don’t meant tighter as in dry, I mean tighter as if ya girl got a facelift or something. I tried it back in April and fell in love, it hydrated my skin too. (I tend to have dry skin sometimes bc I do use a lot of salycic acid products for any blemishes that may come up. But anyways! I hope this works for you the way it did me !"
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Canada,Holy grail!,I first tried this from a little sample pouch and was seriously hooked. And the more I use it the better it gets. Anyone saying it’s too rich or made them oily is just using too much because a little goes a very long way. I’ve noticed a huge difference in my skin within just a few weeks.
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Australia,Night cream Caudalie,"It is really really good night cream. I love the smell and texture.
Definitely gonna buy it again. 
I recommend this product."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Good for dry skin,"My skin feels really good after using this cream. I would recommend it to folks with dry skin. It has a light scent, which is pleasant."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,"Juicy! This 54 year old can’t wait to put this on each night. It is luxurious! The scent is subtle, yet something I’d love in a body wash . It plumps and hydrates my skin, never oily. I believe it’s water based almost gel like. I will never use another cream. This is also priced right."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Canada,The BEST for dry skin,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is the BEST thing for dry skin!! This moisturizer is so nourishing & hydrating!! 

I saw a difference at the first use! I woke up with a plump, radiant & smoother skin! I honestly couldn’t recommend enough. This is definitely my new night cream!"
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Singapore,Good,I like this night cream. The product is emollient and non greasy. It gets absorbed quickly into the skin. I have used it for a while and keep repurchasing it. 
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Australia,hydrate and smooth,"Only use at the night time after toner, serum and eye cream. This resveratrol lift firming night cream give my face hydration and make my skin more smooth, but I didn’t see the benefit of lift or firming, quite disappointed."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,amazing,"I felt it work, saw immediate difference.  in my opinion I'm happy when a product isn't masked with perfumes. that means to me, the ""real"" stuff is in it and working. if I want parfum on my face I'll spray it after words.  (makes no sense) I can deal with any smell for the better of my skin...(Well almost) and I must say there is no smell) people prior must be talking about nature. this product is great. I'm 49 just turned. redness some on cheeks, sensitive skin,  can't handle fragrance and combination skin ,getting dry."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Singapore,Night cream,I used this night cream for months and so far I don't see any improvement. I like that it doesn't make my skin dry anymore. I've changed to a new moisturizer.
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Canada,best one for firming skin,"My mil is  in her 60s and using it and she likes it so far ,I would recommend it to the ppl who are in 50,60s"
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Australia,Caudalie lifting firming night cream,"A beautiful cream, lovely scent, lovely to use, I noticed some umping & hydration effect almost immediately, was also lucky enough to receive a gift from them also. "
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,"Not a fan. Also, i usually am not one that complains about scents but this one… yeah i could not take."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Will buy it again,Good night time moisturizer. Didn't see any results but it is still better than some other. Off course everyone skin is different
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Malaysia,Ms.,"Product absorbs well into skin but other than that, I don’t see any effectiveness on face firming. If anything I feel my skin has sagged and aged even more. Regret buying this."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Not a fan,"I used this entire jar up and have nothing to show for it. Did it moisturize? Yes, but not enough for my winter dry skin. Did it feel good? Mostly, but it truly felt like it just sat on top of my skin. Was it irritating? No, very gentle.  But not good enough to repurchase."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Disappointed,"Considering how expensive it is, it did absolutely nothing to my skin."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,I got this before the start of winter to prepare my skin to the cold. At first I enjoyed the velvet texture this gave my skin but my skin always looked refreshed and plump in the mornings which is a plus. This definitely is helping keep my skin hydrated and I don’t know how any other night moisturizer can compare to this product now.
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,love!,Love! On my third tub! So moisturizing and feels so nice going on.
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Amazing,This cream is amazing. My prior night moisturizer wasn’t heavy enough for the winter. My skin looks and feels so plump and healthy. I was worried the herbal fragrance would irritate my sensitive skin but it does not. It’s a very light and pleasant smell.
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Easily one of my favorite products. Hydrates and plumps. Love the texture and the texture it gives my skin
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Another Caudalie Classic,"The morning after I first used this, my skin was glowing. I am a dedicated Caudalie fan and I love the luxurious, creamy feel of this. I pair it with the Vino Perfect serum before bed. Giving it four stars because I’ve only been using it for a month, but haven’t noticed a huge difference since day 1"
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Singapore,firming cream ,"I am quite disappointed with the cream to be honest. For a night cream of this price point I expected it to feel more rich and luxurious. The cream doesn’t seem that different from drugstore creams and the scent is a bit artificial. I will need to try it longer to see its effects but I will likely not repurchase as I prefer the other night creams I have tried (Fresh, SKII, Tatcha etc). "
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Favorite Night Cream,I always say that I don't feel compelled to continue to repurchase a product if I think I can find a better one. This one I am repurchasing. Very hydrating for my skin that tends dry. My skin feels smoother in the morning with this at night.
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Canada,Ingredients listed are not the ones you actually g,"I just bought this and it works well. I only give it 3 stars because I have not idea if what I bought actually corresponds to the real product adversities. It has no smell. It does not have the same ingredients (not at all !!!) listed on product as advertised on website. Very disappointed. Ingredients are: water, butylene glycol, caprate, squalene, alcohol, TG, hydrogenated oil, triheptanoin, grape seed oil, etc… without any of the website ingredients or the order listed."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Malaysia,Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,"Caudalie is one of my favourites skincare brand,  It really hydrates my skin and visibly firming result on me"
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Singapore,Average,"Given its high price tag, I was expecting results but this product did not quite live up to expectations. Unlikely to repurchase. There are similar products from other brands to try"
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Can't quit you,A little goes a long way. It is smooth and leaves your skin skin and hydrated in the morning. Been using it for months and can't seem to quit it. Results are too good!
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Malaysia,Not suitable for sensitive skin,"I had breakouts right after the first use, probably because of the super strong fragrance. Been using other Caudalie products without any issues. This is just a miss."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Amazing,"I love this night cream because it helps me hydrate and reduce the appearance of my fine wrinkles, it is now one of my favorites in my skincare routine."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Wake up to healthy hydrated skin!!,"This is the resveratrol-lift firming night cream, it has a very slight scent to it. I have found this night cream to be a good quality one that actually gets absorbed into my skin. How do I know? Well with other nightly face creams I can feel them washing away from my face in the morning when I shower. This one is different I don't feel it washing away. My skin is soft and moisturized. My face feels very hydrated, skin feels smooth, and although I don't feel any tightening or tingling for it to firm. I do feel it makes my skin look good. So far I am happy with the results I am seeing. I can only imagine with longer usage how my skin will look even better. For me this isn't something that has given me results overnight, but I do look at my skin and feel it is working and doing something. This night cream is not thick, it's a lightweight formula."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Great night cream!,"I received a free sample for this night cream #freeproduct. It's a bit early to see any long term results, but it feels great on my dry winter skin skin! Skin isn't tight at all - nice and moisturized, and the pleasant scent is very light and disappears quickly."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Beautiful night cream,"I adore this night cream! It has a creamy, velvety consistency and applies smoothly to the skin. It has a beautiful, light scent that I really enjoy. Upon initial application, my skin looks smooth, soft and supple. It is hydrating and firming, making my fine lines less noticeable. When I wake up, my skin looks plump, moisturized and firm. I thoroughly enjoy this beautiful cream and can see it as a staple in my skincare routine. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox"
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Canada,Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,"I soooo wanted to like this.  I've been looking for something to deal with loss of firmness and crepiness.  Sadly, this was not it.  It's the only new product I've recently added to my skincare lineup, and after using for a couple of weeks I'm dealing with breakout on my cheeks and my skin looks worse than when I started using it."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,would not purchase as full size,"Smells great but very, very thick to apply. Does not soak into skin. Got as part of a kit - love the serum & eye gel but will pass on purchasing this."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,So soft,This is a lightweight moisturizer and feels amazing on your face.  It makes your face feel so soft.  It has a light fragrance that smells like almonds.  Love this stuff.  #trywithtopbox #freeproduct
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,"I received a sample of this moisturizer for testing purposes via Topbox #tryitwithtopbox. I love Caudalie products because they come in really fancy packaging to look at, their smell is incredibly delicious. After using this product my face looks beautiful, smooth, manageable, it is worth mentioning that I have oily skin, I do not have wrinkles but the skin care routine for me is something fundamental in my life, the only expression lines that I have A little marked are the nasolabial folds, but I know that this product helps to firm the texture of the skin. I expect long term results, luckily it leaves no oily residue and that is a Super plus for me. #freeproduct #freeproducttesting #topboxcircle #tryitwithtopbox"
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,in LOVE,This saved my skin! A caudalie rep recommended it and it did not disappoint! I will be purchasing the day cream during the VIB sale! LOVVVVVE!
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,"I was wary about using this at first as I’m young and don’t use anti-aging products, however, this product, Caudalie Firming Night Cream, is amazing! It definitely moisturized my skin, and made my face smoother. I use it in the night (of course) and it doesn’t sting after using any acne treatments. Even if you don’t use anti aging products, this is really good for dry skin! #freeproduct #trywithtopbox"
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,"I love this product. It has a smooth and velvety texture that just melts as it goes on to my skin. It has a nice, but not overpowering, scent to it. It made my skin so smooth and felt plumped a bit later. #freeproduct"
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Canada,Light Cream and Works for Resveratrol,"I found resveratrol really works after taking it orally for a month; I took it with CoQ10 that took off at least several  years aging; all fine lines became  light and skin looks so tight and bright from inside out. therefore I bought this cream and it also feels good to use. I was doubtful as taking resveratrol made me super thirsty and feel not normal at the beginning, however, I am happy now"
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Great moisturizer but don't see any other benefit,"This is probably more of a 3.5 * review but since I can't leave part of a *, I aired on the side of the fact that I didn't see the claimed results in the end. 

NOTE: i received this #freeproduct Courtesy of  #trywithtopbox 

The pros:  
 - like other Caudalie products, it smells great. My husband even remarked after I put it on every night - and he NEVER notices those things. 
 - a little goes a LONG way. Although I only received 2 packets to test, I was able to easily get 8 full applications
 - my skin was decidedly smooth from use and this is absolutely a great (albeit expensive) overall moisturizer

the cons: 
 - I did not see any results CLOSE to the claimed benefits of increased firmness or line reduction (this could be due to only 8 days of use since that's all the product I received, but that's all I can go on)
- I did have some breakouts in the days following my starting to use this product (this is the only thing I changed) but I know that can be due to skin purging, so not a deal breaker for me, but should be noted and planned for. 

All in all, this is a very good moisturizer and I liked the smell and how soft and moisturized it made my skin. But it simply didn't deliver in the time I had to test it on its claims. For the value, I can buy a significantly less expensive moisturizer with the same end result.

This one wasn't for me but I love Caudalie and look forward to trying other products! LOVE my current Vinoperfect ones!"
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,"I got a little sample #freeproduct  from caudalie. 
This nigthcream is very soft,velvet feeling IMO
It gives moisture without a grease feeling. 
Also it has a very lovely scent. 
I love the fact that is free of parabens and mineral oil."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,"I used this firming night cream after removing and cleansing my skin. It has a nice citrusy scent to it. I like that it goes on smoothly and it gets absorbed quickly and easily. It is also not sticky. The next day when I wake up, I notice a youthful skin and a skin that is visibly firm, I also notice my pores appearing smaller in size. I really enjoyed using this product so I would recommend it."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,leaves skin soft!,I only got to try a few sample size packets but there are a few things I enjoyed about this moisturizer.  It leaves your skin soft and hydrated after using.  You also don’t need to use much of it as a little goes a long ways.  The scent is light and pleasant I really enjoy it.  The cream rubs into your skin easily and does not leave a residue.  In the morning my skin is glowing and it is very easy to apply makeup.
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Amazing,"This product has worked very well for me! I currently use this product along with the Firming Eye cream, serum and day cream! I have loved every product I have used from them. It never leaves any oily residue while still leaving my Skin looking hydrated and glowing! The smell is identical to the smell of flowers. This leaves my skin feeling so fresh and clean! I will definitely be buying this product again!! #freeproduct #freeproducttesting #topboxcircle"
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Nice firming night cream,"I really enjoyed using Caudalie firming night cream. It absolutely does what it sounds like. The rich creamy texture of cream fully gets absorbed into skin leaving no residue on skin. My skin looks nourished, smooth and visibly improved."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Original formula better. It still feels good.,I love Caudalie moisturizers. I would have given a 5 star review except for the fact that the formula has been changed. This night cream used to be thicker and stayed on my face through the night. This new formula is more like a day cream. Still feels good though.
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,"I received a few samples of this product and I used this night cream for about a week. So far, I really like it because it isn’t too heavy, but it is super moisturizing and it’s helped any dryness that I had from using actives in my routine. I totally recommend this product it you need hydration, including those with oily skin like me. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox"
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,"I tried the Caudalie Resveratrol Lift Firming Night Cream and it works really well for my skin.

I have oily skin so I don't usually use creams, but I like this one. It smells very nice. It is hydrating and nourishing. My skin feels very moisturized without feeling oily or heavy. I did notice a slight tightening/firming sensation after applying it. Which in turn reduces the look of fine lines. It left my skin feeling silky smooth and soft.

The scene is fresh greenery but goes away in minutes. It made my skin so smooth and felt plumped a bit later.  It is perfect to use by itself but in colder climates, may need extra moisture after.  It is light night cream so not greasy but not thick enough for dry skin. But overall very soft and nice feel. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox"

CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Moisturizing,"This firming night cream is very moisturizing. I like that it is unscented and absorbs quickly. I used it for just 3 nights and noticed a brighter complexion. This promises firmer skin, and although I did not experience firmer skin I think you would need to apply it exclusively for at least 14 days for those results. I received a free sample to try this out."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,"I got some samples from Topbox. This night cream is a cream texture that is very absorbed by the skin and is not sticky. Its smell is very special, like the smell of a certain herbal medicine. Some people may not like this smell, but I don't mind. But I have three samples,  I wasn’t able to use it enough to see if there were any long-term results. I have never use Caudalie's product, so I am looking forward to having more opportunities to try its samples.

CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Great Cream of Night Time,I receive a free sample of the Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream from Caudalie and Topbox Circle. The cream is soft and easy to spread on the skin. There is no tugging on the skin and doesn't dry instantly. I like that the cream is thicker for nighttime skincare because that means it will keep my skin moisturized while I sleep and make it supple in the morning for easy makeup application. There is a slight scent that isn't overpowering and it smells like flowers like chamomile and lavender.  I feel like my skin is very nourished and soft. I like that it isn't heavy on my skin which makes it comfortable for me to leave it on. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct

#trywithtopbox#freeproduct"
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Lovely,"Really nice cream. I love how luxurious it feels on the skin. Helped keep my face from completely drying out overnight, which is a must during winter. The area along my jawline/cheek area doesn't look as ""droopy"" for lack of a better word, so I feel like the firming is being achieved too. I received a free sample and have been using this for several months and this has been one of few products to help get my skin through midwest fall/winter and keep my eczema at bay. #trywithtopbox"

CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Perfect for dry skin,"This is the perfect night cream for my skin. I tend to have dry spots around the nose, and this rich cream works good in hydrating the area. When I wake up my nose is peeling less. It is very  hard for me to find a cream that will fit my skin as I also have acne and some products irritate my skin. I love the clean ingredients list, I try to avoid bad chemicals. The scent of it is very soft, I like it."

It has a nice scent, not too strong.  The cream is moisturizing.  I didn't use it long enough to report if it firms my skin."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Decent night cream for firming,This Caudalie firming night cream with resveratrol lift is a decent cream but not my favorite product. I like its texture that wasn’t too thick or too thin. I do think it was absorbed by my skin without feeling too greasy. It said it was for dry skin and normal skin. I have normal to combo skin. I usee this cream on neck mostly. This cream has a herbal scent. I’m not a fan of the scent. A plus is that I didn’t get breakouts from this cream. I only got 3 small samples for testing purposes. It is quite disappointing because I’d like to test it longer for the skin benefits. My first impression is 3 stars because I only got 3 small samples to try #freeproduct  #trywithtopbox
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,"I've really been enjoying this night cream! I think it's really expensive, but most skincare is. This cream is super moisturizing and sinks into the skin quickly. I love that it contains hyaluronic acid, which helps leave the skin feeling supper hydrated and plump. It's lightly scented but it isn't overwhelming. Caudalie always uses recyclable packaging and has good, mostly natural ingredients which is a major plus in my book! #freeproduct #trywithtopbox"
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Canada,One of the best night creams,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this as a sample from Topbox Circle. I was immediately attracted to the scent as it was pleasantly mild and not string or overpowering in any way. I loved the packaging too. As for the cream itself, I gave it a full two weeks of use to be able to determine a notable difference. And I did.. my skin was more moisturized and matte.. my pores appeared to have shrunk, close friends and family have noticed and complimented me on my improved-looking skin. I would definitely buy this night cream for myself in the future.

CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Great night cream,"I really enjoyed using the firming night cream.

CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,Plump and glowing skin,"I received 6ml of this product to sample (3 x 2ml sachets). I've been using this nightly for a little over a week as I'm writing my review. I can say that my skin feels much plumper and firmer than before. It's perfect for me in the winter as it's hydrating. The only con to this is that I did break out a bit around my mouth with small white pimples after the 2nd day of use, but it's cleared up by now for the most part. The break-out is the only reason I put it at 4 stars for now."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,My favorite cream even for daytime use,"I love this night cream because it is very moisturizing, rich texture, more dense than the Cashemere day cream but still lightweight, it absorbs very fast and gives the most velvety and smooth skin you can ever imagine with zero greassy/sticky feeling which I hate.
I use it as a day cream also (it´s my favorite between the two products) since I love this velvety feeling and let me tell you I´m a makeup artist and I do not have to use any primer when I apply this little wonder on my face before my makeup. ¡BAM!
The scent of the whole line is a subtle mix of minty/flowers/citrus aroma. In my opinion it is a very relaxing and millionarie experience which completaly worth the money.
I received this #freeproduct from @topbox #trywithtopbox and @caudalieus in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,nice,Whoa! This is phenomenal!  This is such a dreamy product. It’s silken and soft. I love it. It feels so pleasant and my skin feels lifted up! It’s lightweight at bed time.

I love the fact that this is considered a clean beauty item which means it is free from over 50 questionable ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, mineral oil, formaldehyde, and more. I feel very lucky that I got to try this product for free, I received three free samples with top box circle. I love this cream so much I had to purchase a full size because now I cannot live without it #freeproduct  #trywithtopbox"
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,USA,New Formula.,"It’s a new product.  Totally different consistency.  It Was a staple of mine which I would rate at 5!! Now...meh.  Not thrilled.  My skin feels ok, but it doesn’t have the rich consistency of the old formula, and you need more product to cover same area."
CAUDALIE-Resveratrol-Lift Firming Night Cream,Canada,Sensational,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) #freeproduct #trywithtopbox

Caudalie the name itself excites me on all their products. There isn't one product that I have tried that I haven't liked. Caudalie Resveratrol-Lift Firming night cream is a not too thick and not a sticky product. After cleansing your face and applying this product your face feels so soft. I haven't tried it long enough to see the results of the firming part but I can't wait to see the results."

ALLIES OF SKIN-Peptides & Antioxidants Firming Daily Treatment,Singapore,Holy Grail product ,"This product is my holy grail and I have repurchased it multiple times both on Sephora and the Allies of Skin (AOS) website. It is moisturising, calming, and leaves my skin with a nice glow. However, you are better off purchasing this product directly on the AOS website (especially when there are discount codes) as Sephora inflates the price of the product.  "
ALLIES OF SKIN-Peptides & Antioxidants Firming Daily Treatment,Australia,Brilliant,"This product contains everything you need in a good daily moisturiser. The list of ingredients and texture is perfect.  Goes on smoothly, easily under make-up and sunscreen. Have purchased twice."

ALLIES OF SKIN-Peptides & Antioxidants Firming Daily Treatment,Singapore,Love this!,I use this as a moisturiser both day and night. My dehydrated skin looks healthy  within days of using this. I've since bought spares as I can't imagine not using this. Game changer indeed.
ALLIES OF SKIN-Peptides & Antioxidants Firming Daily Treatment,Singapore,YESSS,"Have been want to try this for a million years, love love love this. Also it's a home grown brand so I love it even more. Very soothing and moisturizing. Works as intended"
ALLIES OF SKIN-Peptides & Antioxidants Firming Daily Treatment,Singapore,My everyday moisturiser,I have been using this as a day moisturiser for the past 2 years and I always still go back to this after trying out other products. I use it after their probiotic facial mist and it's really good at keeping breakouts at bay for me. And it keeps my dry skin hydrated throughout the day.  
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,Australia,The only cream that works for me,"My skin became super dry after giving birth and while breastfeeding. I spent hundreds of dollars buying and trying new creams in recent months but nothing worked for me, until I came across this moisturiser. It has a nice texture and smell. While other creams staying on top of my skin, this one absorbs fast. My skin feels hydrated. Plus, the ingredients are clean, so I don’t need to worry when my baby has her cheek against my cheek or touches my face then sucks her hands. I am very happy that I found this great product. "
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,Singapore,Moisturiser,Texture is light and is suitable for my sensitive skin. Used it for day and it gets absorbed quite quickly.

STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,Singapore,Best moisturiser ,My go to moisturiser. Try others and I’m back again. Love the consistency. Not too oily and enough for my oily/dry skin. Please do not discontinue this. 
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,New Zealand,I wanted to love this ,"I really wanted to love this product. But for the price and amount I will not purchase it again. 

There are comparable products that come in beautiful and sustainable glass jars from Glow Recipe that are a much better price with more product. I hate a chunky plastic jar and that is exactly what you get with this. 

The texture of the product is ok. It melts into the hands into a thick cream that is quit heavy but it does soak in OK. If you’re putting this over serums it almost too heavy. 

I think the brand has tried to sell you a package rather than a great product. I would be much more inclined to purchase this again AND recommend it if it had more product and came in a glass jar. This just isn’t worth the money for what it is. "
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,Australia,THE BEST,Omg I’m literally in awe and shock by how amazing this moisturiser feels on my skin. It acts like a blurring primer makes my skin look so alive and awake you can wear this underneath ur makeup with ur primer ofcourse and it makes ur makeup look so much better! I got this as a sample from Sephora and fell in love with it definitely worth the money 
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,Australia,Obsessed! ,Bought this on a whim and will definitely re-purchase! Nice and thick without feeling heavy or greasy.

STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,Malaysia,pudding moisturizer,It has a pudding texture but it spreads effortlessly on the face. Not a fan of the scent but it's bearable once you get used to it. Does it job in providing moisture and doesn't break me out
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,Singapore,orglamic pink cactus,"Nice texture just that one down side is the packaging of the tub keeps coming out and pricey. Will consider getting again in future 


Package is pretty 
"
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,New Zealand,Luxury for your skin,I checked all the ingredients before buying so the expectation was high and the product delivers. It feels really nice on my combination mid 40s skin. The mini container is indeed mini but you don't use alot to get plenty of coverage. 
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,Australia,Impressed ,Great moisturiser that I use in the morning and night. A small bit goes a long way. I was concerned about the texture of this product as it has a pudding like consistency but was actually great. Comes with a spatula which is great to prevent germs contaminating the product. Would definitely buy again! I have dry to combination skin. 
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,Malaysia,Love the glow in am!,"i have to say i love the glow in the morning. Skin looks fresh, dewy and extremely hydrated. The smell is good, light and fruity. i use it mostly in the pm, and it works well with serum and oils. i like the effect so much that i'd splatter a generously amount on my face. 
my cons - i didnt like the use of the scoop, it's just too troublesome to keep it clean all the time. Then again, it wouldn't work without it. You couldnt get that jelly like cream out of the container nicely with your finger tips. "
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,Australia,I’m in love ,"I have always struggled with finding a good moisturiser for my skin, (my skin gets oily and dry at the same time) and I have tried many and many, but they all just did not work.

STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,Singapore,One of the best moisturisers!,"This is my 2nd time purchasing this moisturiser.

STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,Texture,"The texture of this moisturiser is exactly like a pudding with a nice pinky shade. Smells great like pudding too. A little goes a long way. For a 15ml content, felt like I am using it forever. However I felt like it is not moisturising enough for dry skin. "
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,cutie!,this is a game changer with the texture that was thought weird in the beginning but worked so well on the skin in the end. will definitely repurchase this once done!
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,Like it,I really like this moisturiser and find it to be very moisturising for my combination skin. A little bit goes a long way and I really like the texture and smell. I definitely think it’s a product some people will like and others won’t so I recommend getting a sample or trying it in store before buying. Especially cause it’s so expensive!
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,oily combination ,I have combination skin..I didn’t see much progress since it has been a month .some of the reviews says need to use for 8 weeks for result.I got the small bottle and still can last me another month or 2.It doesn’t make my skin oily like how other brand does. I have no complain so far.
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,Love ,This is one of my faves. Lasts ages and feels great on the skin. It actually gives your skin a glow from within and the smell is so good you want to eat it.
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,Burning Sensation,"Bought this after reading reviews and I really wish I hadn't. I've tried it twice now and both times I get a severe burning, tingling sensation when using it. I don't have any allergies that I'm aware of to any of the ingredients and my skin isn't sensitive (this is literally the only product I have ever had a negative reaction to), so I have no idea what about it doesn't agree with me. Won't be buying this or any other products in this range now though."
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,Not bad,"Was attracted with the texture in the sense that it is non-sticky, absorbs well and suits my dry / combination skin, plus it is just as moisturizing as my other moisturizers."
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,Not bad,Not a fan of the pudding texture. Scent can be abit overwhelming. It does moisturise though. Love the packaging and the cute bottle. Not sure I will buy again. 
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,It's okay,It makes a great makeup base and has an amazing scent. But I am rating it stars because I don't see how it has improved my skin and it is difficult to pick up the product without the spoon. Too much packaging waste as it comes in a small bag and plastic spoon. The price is also expensive. 
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,Good moisturiser,It’s a nice moisturiser that feels good on the skin and was good to my sensitive acne-prone skin. But it wasn’t anything extra and the moisturising effects felt only short-term. 
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,Very Hydrating,"At first, you think 'pudding' and am awestruck once you open up this beautifully packaged moisturizer. It even comes with an applicator to keep the product sanitary. It's deeply nourishing, perhaps sometimes a little too much if used with the wrong products, and can leave your face feeling a bit greasy. I have found the right balance using this with a Hyaluronic Serum & Vitamin C cream underneath. It does require a bit of product, but if you set a good base it'll minimize how much is needed."
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,Really good!,"Was a little doubtful initially. But all the fantastic reviews made me decide to try it out! It’s thick and creamy. But doesn’t feel like that on the face. And going out in the heat also feels fine. Best of all, i have no rash as I usually do with other moisturisers 
"
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,melts right in,"love love love this. melts so nicely into the skin, so hydrating. i love it. i only wish it came with a spatula because it’s very hard to get out with your fingers..."
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,moisturising and that’s it,"It doesn’t do anything else but moisturise my face and even then it doesn’t really go into my skin. I guess if your skin is super dry and doesn’t have any other concerns (eg, uneven tone, redness, enlarged pores, acne, wrinkles, sagginess) then this is for you. "
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,pink cactus pudding moisturiser ,"so far i love this product, its moisture my skin and always keep my skin hydrated but i don't like the pudding texture, i love watery texture for moisturiser "
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,EVERYONE NEEDS THIS,"Absolutely love this moisturiser. It smells amazing, packaging is super cute and sleek and comes with a spatula for application. Love this under makeup or at night before bed. Would be 5 stars if it wasn’t so pricy! "
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,Love Texture,"This product is amazing for the skin, absolutely love it, the jar is expensive but the product inside is beautiful and the component makes it feel worth the splurge. The only thing you'll hate is when you dig into the product for the first time, and it ruins the smooth layer "
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,Absolutely Stunning,"I’m always a bit skeptic about buying new skincare due to how sensitive my skin is, almost everything breaks me out. So when I got this I was amazed at how much it benefited my skin.
This moisturiser, first of all, comes in absolutely stunning packaging which is durable and luxurious, it would be super easy to take away with you without having to worry about breakages or spillages. 
It comes with a little spoon which is awesome for hygiene purposes and was a big tick for me due to my skin sensitivity.
The consistency is just as described, pudding, which is cool and unique, the feel of this is almost like silk once warmed up in your hands, but be warned a little goes a long way.
This product has left my skin feeling more plump and healthy, and it has given me a wonderful flow from within.
I have found my new holy grail moisturiser "
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,gorgeous cream. ,"His cream ticks all the boxes - it comes in a beautiful jar, has very nice scent and impressive ingredients list. It feels very light yet does a good job at hydrating your skin"
STARSKIN-Orglamic™ Pink Cactus Pudding Moisturiser,,awesome product,"Love! love! love! this product!. It fixed my hydration problem easily. To make things easily, it comes with a little spoon to help you scoop the product out. Definitely a must have"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Malaysia,Just ok,Just ok for me. Maybe because I’m not a fan of mattifying moisturiser as it doesn’t feel moisture absorption when u apply onto ur skin. Feel like I’m wearing matiffying primer. 
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,New Zealand,A great daytime moisturiser ,I’ve been searching far and wide for a light moisturiser that absorbs effectively but doesn’t leave my skin dry. This cream definitely fits those requirements. Have purchased 3 times now because I am enjoying the results! Works well under make up and primers. 
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,New Zealand,not good for dry skin,"Sadly broke me out REALLY bad, I struggle with acne but I think this product assumes people with acne have oily skin. However I have dry and the matte made it worse, it was also just bad for my acne. Gave me cystic acne which I haven’t had in ages and lots of white dots that I’ve never had before. Not worth the money to try out "
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Malaysia,among the best moisturizer ,I reallllllllyyyyyy love this caudalie moisturizer. It’s not sticky becauase it’s watery type moisturizer. Hope next time ada bigger size so that i can use it longer domt have to wait for next purchase 😍😍😍
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,Light & hydrating,"Light texture & hydrating enough for the day. Has a matt finish so it’s easy to use under make up. But I don’t feel that it really helps to mattify the skin. I have oily skin but very dry cheeks so this will not really hydrate super dry areas. Didn’t really like the scent as well, too heavy for my liking. "
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Australia,not bad ,Skin feels so smooth of using this and it isn’t to marrying like oh can still see the glow of your skin from your cheekbones when turned to the side. Which is a perfect 
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,I love this moisturisers ,I love love love this moisturiser. It absorbs real fast. No sticky feeling. Leave my face feeling fresh seriously. And I love how when I when my makeup after using this. My makeup feels hydrated and stays longer. I wish it came in a larger tube. 40ml is too little and I get nervous using too much of it twice a day.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,Love this moisturiser!,"I bought this full-size moisturiser after using a sample that I received from Sephora. I like it so much. I was suffering from a sudden hormonal breakout in my 40s and have used many other products to no avail. This moisturizer surprisingly did not sting my sensitive skin, it didn't turn my skin red either like other products for breakout control. I love how it dries down to a matte finish without drying my skin out and still feels hydrated underneath. My breakouts have diminished in size the next morning after using it. I bought the whole vinopure range, and this moisturiser is certainly my favourite. "
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,Ms,"OH I LOVE THIS. the texture of the cream is really soft and thin, not like a gel which can clog up your pores. even if you use too much of it, it absorbs well into the skin and doesn’t ball up or make the skin too shiny! it makes the skin look really natural and lasts almost the whole day!!"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Malaysia,oily skin,I'll never change my moisturizer againnnn!!!! super duperrr loveee this moisturizer. make my skinnn less oilyy. I'll bought 2nd tubes. sephora plsss restock thiss!!!!
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,good,"non sticky, good moisturiser overall. price range is pretty high for such little product but it does wonders to my skin and the hydration is very good!"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,not bad but not great,"It's a decent moisturizer with a therapeutic scent. However, I don't think it is suitable for oily skin type as this moisturizer makes my face overly oily after a few hours and it is supposed to be for oily/acne prone skin. prefer the serum in the same line than this."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Good but no sun protection,This moisturizer is great at helping with my oily skin. It does a good job at mattifying before applying makeup. I only gave it 3 stars though because it doesn’t contain SPF. A girl needs her sun protection!
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,not impressive,"Too expensive. Strong scent and no visible mattifying effect. Be careful with application, will start balling up on face. Quite a small tube for price."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,This has been AMAZING!!! My face has never felt so clean I have such oily red skin and the whole line is INCREDIBLE I started off with the 30 day kit and I’m already planning on purchasing more!! Definitely recommend for people with acne and red skin
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Love this moisturizer!! Very light and mattifying!
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,doesn’t deliver,I’m a caudalie die hard fan but that only applies to everything but their moisturizers. This was definitely the best one I’ve tried yet but still didn’t really enjoy using and noticed no real benefit. I think this moisturizer made my skin a little oily as all the caudalie moisturizers do. But take that with a grain of salt because I really have a hard time finding a good moisturizer that doesn’t. I wouldn’t repurchase.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Great brand. Cleared up my face!! Smells fresh and doesn’t make your face oily!
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is by far the best product I’ve tried as a free sample and now I buy the full size. I apply it after toner and it has dramatically minimized the size of my pores and the texture of my skin has become much smoother. This product is definitely my holy grail and changed my skin for the better. (Even when I stopped using it for a couple week my skin still remained smooth and clear) I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve their skin texture and the size of pores.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Not for Sensitive Skin,"I didn't notice any mattifying effect. Furthermore, this product irritated my skin due to the peppermint oil which is very strong."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Australia,Great moisturiser ,I’ve been using this moisturiser for almost two years now. I started off with this to give it a go and see if my combination skin would like it and it does. It’s a lovely lightweight moisturiser and works well for my skin. My skin has looked so much better in the last year + since I’ve started using Cauldalie. I’ve found the range that works best for me 
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Doesn't Work,"I got this because my skin gets oily throughout the day and this was supposed to help. Within half an hour my skin was shiny, when I applied it initially my face just felt dry, and the bottle is tiny for what you get. Very disappointing."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,wonderful,I had a bad experience with wishful’s honey balm (used it twice and my skin went completely dry and broke out). This moisturizer fixed me right up. Highly recommend
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,Blurs imperfections? Yes.,"I can’t say much about the moisturising effect, because I dont have dry skin. But it feels like it locks in all the serums that I used better than other moisturisers. Blurs my imperfections to a certain degree definitely."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,especially for oily skin,"I highly recommend this for those who need hydration and have oily, sensitive skin. It is true to what it says in that it does not clog pores. Great for the super hot and humid weather."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Malaysia,good,"This moisturizer works well with my oily skin. It's lightweight and doesn't make my skin looks greasy. The ingredients are good too, but I'm still yet to see any results in terms of brightening after using it for a week as it contains niacinamide and was supposed to help brightens the skin"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Malaysia,The One ☝️ ,"Finally!! Caudalie Vinopure (cleanser, toner, serum, moisturiser and the beauty elixir) have save my skin from bad pores and blemishes. This is my third time purchasing these products from Caudalie and I have been using them for a year and half now which I think is really worthwhile. Love it!! "
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,"This moisturizer changed my skin completely! I have dry, blemish prone skin and this helped with breakouts immensely."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Eh...,"While it does keep my skin moisturized, the smell is not that good, and the texture is off. I won't buy again."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Malaysia,i love this!,It calmed my acne prone skin. I thought i will not like it but surprisingly i love it! When my skin felt irritated i apply this and it calmed the itchiness and pimples
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,PRICEY BUT WORKS.,I was a little annoyed with the price point for such a small tube of this. The fact is it actually works for my oily combo skin! I love it so much. I feel moisturized and refreshed plus I’m not oily like 30 minuets later lol.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,love the scent! ,"This moisturiser goes well on my skin and I love the scent :) esp during the application at night (helps me to sleep well). However it’s quite costly, would only buy again during sale or promotion I think."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,This is stupid good,"I have lived that constant oily skin life since I was 16. I've tried every moisturizer under the sun but have consistently been disappointed with products that don't control oil, pill up and get gummy or don't moisturize at all. This is the FIRST product that has made a dramatic difference on my oily skin and still keeps me feeling moisturized. It is my new holy grail! THANK YOU"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Australia,Skin Type: Combination ,"I'm not too sure about how I feel about this moisturiser.
I havent had any issues with it where I've broken out but I don't feel I'm getting many benefits from it.

I'd definitely recommend giving it a try though, it could work a treat on your skin."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Australia,Doesn't Work For Me,Was recommended this by one of the sale ladies in store because it's one of their natural brands which I'm wanting to incorporate more into my skin care. I have combination skin (oily/normal) but this really didn't work at least for me. It is mattifying somewhat but it causes me to break out even more then I already do. So that's a definite no no for me. It may work for others but not for my skin.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Best Oil Control,"Finally I found a true Oil Control Moisturizer that really works. If you have an oily acne-prone skin and live in humid city, this is going to be your friend. No oily skin after hours."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Amazing moisturizer. Makes my skin feel so much less oily ever after working 9 hours straight with a face mask on.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,ermmm ok ,Just ok. Not much feeling after applying and I don’t see obvious mattifying effect (combination skin to oily skin). I think I’ll not repurchase it again. 
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,A great DAY moisturizer,"This DAY moisturizer is what you are looking for if you are extremely oily, have sensitive skin and is acne prone. I noticed that it definitely eased my inflamed cheeks and reduced my acne after three days use. Understand that you will need to follow up with an SPF because the ingredient Niacinamide will cause your skin to be sensitive towards sunlight. A great SPF for sensitive/acne prone skin is from Biossance :)"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,Yes I like,"I think the scent is not for everyone, not floral type , it's a little minty. Wears well in Singapore's weather.  I like the packaging , you squeeze out the moisturizer , so it's cleaner. It is a bit like gel moisturizer . Not oily , and not too mattifying . I'm a combination skin . "
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,mattifying,Smells refreshing. Good for a perk me up in the morning  and it is really mattifying. Would repurchase this. Minus half a star because its a bit pricey.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,Occlusive texture,"As far as mattifying goes... it's pretty normal. But I'm not big on this product because it's so occlusive i.e. it stays on top of my skin without getting absorbed, so you'll always feel a ""layer"". It's heavier than it looks, so I only use this at night. I didn't mind the citrus scent at first but found it to be pretty overpowering after a while. Overall, not going to re-purchase."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,love this,still cant see the results yet but i'm pleased to use this. the smell is fresh and feel cool after use this and pls careful around eye corners. recommend for oily skin.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,"love this product! toned down my acne, helped even out my skin, smells incredible and feels super fresh"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,It does it’s job at moisturizing the skin but it feels really heavy. It also has a smell and I honestly hate when moisturizers have fragrance but that my fault because I didn’t look at the ingredient list before buying.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,This moisturizer made my normally very oily skin super matte. I was honestly shocked. The down side was that it left it feeling very tight and not moisturizer. I was worried that because it made my oil production go away that my skin would try and produce more oils. I feel like this product would work the best before putting in makeup.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,Just OK,"I don’t know how much rating I should for this product, for me this moisturiser is just a ‘normal’ moisturiser and doesn’t worth this price. Smell like ginger and lemongrass, some kind like you’re at the SPA. Might need to rethink again if need to repurchase."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,Amazing!,"This cream is amazing, absorbed by skin immediately without making it dry. It moisturises for the whole day and smells fresh. Really recommend this - try it with the serum too."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,Mattifying? yes.,"It is mattifying, and has this herbally scent to it (which i personally do not hate). Ingredients and formulations are not the best as its not fragrance free. "
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Nice spring/summer moisturizer for combo/oily skin,"I’ve been using this moisturizer during the summer months every year since it came out. A few moisturizers I’ve got before in the same price range either would make me break out or would make my skin too dry. This moisturizer keeps my face moisturized without drying it out or making it too oily. Of course, after wearing makeup for 8+ hours I will get some oil but it’s really the best results I’ve gotten so far out of a moisturizer so I’m going to keep buying this. Note: when the temperature drops around October/November I do find this moisturizer to be drying and so I switch to more nourishing one."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Australia,Feels like I’m at a spa ,"Every time I put this on my skin the scent reminds me of being at a day spa. Which I personally love. It’s so fresh! Non greasy, 
absorbs into the skin really nicely, leaves you feeling moisturised but mattified. I have mild acne and have noticed a difference in the overall texture of my skin. I definitely will be buying this again    "
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,New Formula Disappoints,"I wish caudalie would bring back the original vinosource version of this moisturizer, which was perfect for my combo skin. The new formula burned a bit and left my skin tight and dry. I do not recommend."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Just dont add too much,"A little goes a long way with this one. It really does hydrate while working on the oils. the only negative is that if you dont add a small pea sized amount, it creates a film on your face and sort of flakes off as youre applying. I hope I explained that correctly."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Absorbs nicely into your face and smells quite nice.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Singapore,"Interesting smell, good absorption",Smells strongly of ginger for some reason. It doesn't cause me to break out and feels comfortable after application. I'm not sure about the mattifying effect as my forehead is still shiny by midday but my face does feel hydrated.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Great product for oily or combination skin,"I have combination skin and my t-zone feels very oily in the morning but feels overly dry after washing my face. Shortly after it gets oily again. Most moisturizers leave my skin feeling greasy. This product is awesome - leaves my skin feeling moisturized and not at all oily. I apply it in the morning, right after washing my face, before putting on make up. Works great"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,feels great on your skin but not as effective as i hoped
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Some kind of magic in a bottle!,"My skin is oily, as oily as it can get. I have never had luck with moisturizers that claim to be mattifying. This product has completely changed my outlook and expectations. I absolutely love it. My skin stays matte but still looks well-hydrated ALL day when I use this! Despite how well it staves off oiliness, it still hydrates without giving me dry patches or accentuating any fine lines."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Nice moisturizer that adds hydration without clogging my pores. This smells really nice. I like to pair this with the salicylic acid serum to really make my skin look nice.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Works for me!,"I am in my 40’s with oily skin and breakouts for the past 4 years. Was having a hard time finding a moisturizer that wasn’t exasperating my breakouts. So I searched through Sephora  products and Blindly tried this Caudalie lotion. My breakouts literally stopped!! (Well , except during my really hormonal times of the month) This lotion is really lightweight and smells really good and controls the oil on my face. At the end of the day, my face DOES get back to being a little bit oily, but listen, I don’t believe in miracle products. So for me this lotion works and I am a satisfied customer! Seriously it smells really good too"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Love this producy however I wish the tube was bigger as I find I need to use a bit to do my entire face
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,It's alright,I am super oily in my t-zone so I am always looking for products to help control my oil. After using the Origins mattifying moisturizer with willowherb for about a year I decided to try something new. While I do like this moisturizer it doesn't do a lot for my oily skin. It's kind of the same as the Origins one except the Origins smells better. I do like that it's in a tube instead of a container.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,,New Fave Skincare,"I first get to try this when I redeemed my points. The kit includes toner and moisturizer and after my first use, I immediately fell inlove with the product. Its not sticky and it absorbes quickly into the skin and it also has a nice gentle smell. One of the reasons why I bought a full size version."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,YES!,"A friend gave me a sample size of this for Christmas, I have pretty bad skin in terms of oil and acne. I have only been using this once a day, at night, because i live in Arizona and saw the sun exposure warning. Its amazing, I am going to keep this in my routine forever!"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,"Love this moisturizer. I’ve been using the serum for over a year but recently started to use the Cleansers (gel and foam), toner, and moisturizer; and I must say the improvement to my combination/acne prone skin has been amazing. I also alternate several other cleanser and toners with no ill effects. I also use a vitamin C oil (youth to the people) before applying this moisturizer with no pilling. I even use a sunscreen after and it all stays on"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,,Love it,"For a period of time, I actually switched from using this to the Vinosource Moisturizing Mattifying Fluid (the pink one) & I had a minor breakout. Went back to this and my skin is back to normal again! I have skin that's prone to acne, especially during the time of the month. And with this product, I'll probably just get one or two tiny whiteheads (as opposed to those angry red volcanic pimples) which is fine by me."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,bye bye pimples!,"OMG !!! I wasn’t expecting this! I received this cream in a Caudalie set and I was like “ok another moisturizer.. fine”. I tried it a night a had few pimples on my forehead. The next morning, they were all gone! I will definitely repurchase this cream and I will keep it for my bad days."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,,never get enough! ,"love love love love! this is the best moisturizer i ever tried! matte yet hydrating. keep my face oil-free all through the day. i tend to get oily  when i woke up but i never experience such with this moisturizer! natural salicylic acid never irritates me instead, clear my face. i am now acne free. i used the entire collection in vinopure. the toner and serum. the price also very reasonable thinking its from Caudalie. i used this like 3-4 tubes now! "
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Not for makeup users,"Works well for oil control, but I had an issue with this flaking off when applying makeup unfortunately...found it doesn't sit well if you wear foundation on top"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,,Good Moisturiser ,"I bought this after trying the sample version, it very light weight and gets absorbs by the skin fast.. i prefer non greasy moisturisers and this fits the bill... "
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Sorry Caudalie... :(,"I used this product for a few weeks, and I did not have a great experience with it. The scent is pretty strong, which I don't love in skincare products. I felt that it clogged my pores and I had continuous breakouts... there was just always something going on with my skin. I also didn't feel that it mattified my skin noticeably. 

For a great Caudalie experience, I recommend the Vinoperfect Anti Dark Spot Serum and the Vinoperfect Brightening Glycolic Overnight Cream!"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Does not work well on my acne skin,"I have acne prone skin and found myself loving this brand because I truly believe their acne line is AMAZING. I wanted to like this product but it just does not sit well on my skin for some reason. I even find myself breaking out more when I used it. Maybe it was too much for my skin and had a reverse effect where I would produce more oil. Thankfully, I had trial sizes from the value sets I bought and did not purchase a full-size of this. It may work for some skin combos but it did not agree with my skin so I will not buy but recommend others to try a trial size if not sure"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,,works for me,"out of all the moisturizers I've tried for my combination-oily skin, this is the one that worked for me. it really mattified my skin yet also provided hydration for the dry areas of my face. the price is expensive for me but I would re-purchase since this is the only moisturizer that works for my skin."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,,Lovely Formula ,I've been using this after Vinopure Clear Skin Purifying Toner in the morning. It's gentle and mattifying which is perfect for oily skin. I use it as a base for makeup and my skin doesn't get greasy fast. I will repurchase it! Highly recommended 
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,,marc,i use this ceeam during the day after toning and before applying my philisophy cream with spf. i just love how it sinks into the skin giving the matte effect without drying.❤❤❤
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,didnt work,This is a good product smells good and it worked the first couple days for my butter greasy skin then later it just broke me out like crazy even more than what i usually get and now im battling to get rid of my acne i even got on my neck... consider i bought the entire line and started changing and transitioning to it slowly one by one now this is my review of how it didnt work for me this doesn’t mean it wont work on you!
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,,Mattifying Moisturiser,"I have used 2 tubes, one tube can last me about 3 months (use once daily).  It doesn't clog up the pores and gives me white head, however the mattifying effect would be gone in 4 hours in Singapore's weather. "
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,,Love it.,I have dry/combo skin. Dry patches with acne. this product hydrates my skin and does not cause more breakouts. Together with the foam cleanser and toner from the same brand I've noticed a big change in my skin. My makeup also sits nicely over this. only downside is it such a small tube!
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Smells really good and leaves my face feeling clean
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,LOVE IT!,"When using it, you inmediately feel toyu skin moisturized and fresh, it is also pretty good to use as a primer."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,,ms ,"I buy this range for my daughter. She has acne prone sensitive skin and it’s the best we’ve found. Calming, healing, natural and beautiful under makeup to protect her skin. "
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Great amazing skin care product,This a great product.  It helps acne and oily areas.  Keeps dry areas moisturized and oily areas shine free.  I love it!!! I have been using this product for more than a year.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Fresh smell - great every day moisturizer,"I feel like most oil control moisturizers can be very drying. I have combo skin and this left me feeling balanced. Nice smell, and left my face feeling prepped for makeup"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Waste of money,This literally does the opposite of what it's supposed to do. My skin has been way more oily ever since i started using this.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Feels like a mask to cover oil,At first i loved it as i have very oily skin but after a while of use it started to feel like i was applying a thick mask on my face and my oil would build up in weird ways. For how expensive it is and how little you get i don’t recommend. I love the cleanser and serum of this though.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,"Was recommended by a Sephora skincare expert that did my facial. Was not impressed at first. Didn’t make me break out but didn’t think it was doing much for my skin either. Finished the whole bottle and my skin looked great and I believed it was because of the other products i was using at the time (expensive serums, toners, etc.) I switched up my skincare routine after I finished this bottle and started breaking out and my skin texture was bad again. I reintegrated this moisturizer back into my routine and my skin is glowing once again. Do not underestimate!!"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Unfortunately this didn’t work for me. I’m a huge fan of Caudalie but this was a little drying even for my combo/ oily skin. Nothing spectacular so I chose to return it.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Best moisturiser for oily skin,BIG fan of this moisturiser! Can wait to restock the vinopure moisturiser and serum with the August sale!!
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,,keeps my oils at bay ,I have oily skin and using this is a godsend it really keeps my oils tzone wise at bay and makes my makeup not get that oil slick after a few hours I wear this under makeup and also alternate days when I'm not using other brands.it smells amazing too and it's a great mattifying moisturizer.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,Canada,Product pills and sloughs off face,"I really wanted to love this, however I should have listened to some of the reviews ... the texture at first was nice, I can even get past the very strong smell as once it’s applied after a few minutes it goes away. However ... after an hour or two it’s starts coming off my face in little balls and kinda peels and falls off!, kinda hard to explain but it wasn’t good. I can rub all the product off my face, it’s so gross. It’s too bad because I feel like the ingredients would help my acne and have the calming effects I was looking for."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,"an okay product, I wouldn’t repurchase it",It made my pores look smaller and help a lil with my oily skin. I have very oily skin but it doesn’t help with my blemishes at all. It just creates more blemishes for my sensitive skin.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,,Small but Satisfying,"I was worried about the size of it when I bought this at first. Can this last up to 2 to 3 months? I bought this together with the toner and both of them have this soothing scent and cooling effect. What I like other than the scent and cooling effect is that I can feel my skin moisturised (really) instantly, but does it do the job reducing blemishes? I’m not quite sure because I use it in the morning and rarely on the evening. "
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,,mattifying for a while,This product is mattifying but only for a while. Oil on my skin still managed to seeps through after a few hours of wear. The price is quite pricey for the amount of product given. I was taken aback by how slim the tube is. But i only need a pea size of product for each use and i still reach for this product daily because of its lightweight texture and it is moisturizing. 
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Not for my skin,"I wanted to love this, but it turned out weird...I have oily skin and for the first week, it was great and mattifying, and now suddenly when I put it on, my t zone starts to sweat!! Literally.  Beads of sweat start to form and dont go away! I gave to wipe sweat off my face all day!"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,,My combo acne prone skin loves it!,"This moisturiser is light weight and gel-like so it absorbs into the skin quick, which is great in this humid weather. It works well under makeup too. Am on my second tube of it! "
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Love it!,Excellent product. The only ones useful to control my oily skin.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,,moisturizer,I have already tried the Caudalie toner which was really good for my skin and so was thinking of trying this one out. Package was well received and safely secured. Quantity a little bit small for the price but guessing that a small amount of product will go a long way. Tried the product out in the shop and was a bit of sticky on face. Hope my skin will react as the same way with the toner. Fingers crossed.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,yes yes yes!,Amazing!! 100% recommend this moisturizer and the entire VinoPure line of products. My hormonal acne has finally stopped and it’s because of this product line!!
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,,nice citrus smell,"I love Caudalie products but this is the first time I bought and used this variant. It has a very nice citrus smell. Stings a little bit but goes away after a while. It was stickier than the Vinosource moisturizer upon application but once it dries, my skin feels smooth and not sticky at all. "
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,USA,Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Moisturizer,"I was looking to get another Vinosource Moisturizing Mattifying Fluid, but apparently Sephora doesn't carry that specific product anymore. I figured I'd go with the Vinopure Oil Control Moisturizer, since it's also a mattifying product, but one of the ingredients smells a bit... spicy? Like ginger. I think it's the peppermint. It's not necessarily off-putting, but it made me cautious in using the product. It seems to work, though, ensuring my skin doesn't dry out but at the same time keeping it from becoming too shiny. My first preference is still the Vinosource line, but this'll do in its absence."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Highly recommend,Such an amazing moisturizer. It addresses all of my skincare concerns.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I originally got this product as a sample.  I live in a harsh winter climate, and I loved the sample enough to buy the full-size product.  I'm now almost completely through the container, and I have to say, I love this moisturizer, but lets clear a few things up.  #1 - This alone will not hydrate your skin much.  If you need hydration, put a light gel-moisturizer on, let it soak in, and put this on top of it.  This stuff is very thick and it will lock in hydration, but if you're applying it onto dry skin without adding hydration first, you might not get the results you're looking for.  #2 - This is my go to for winter months but it's a bit heavy for summer months.  You might want to find something lighter if you're looking for something to use year round.  I use this product *as needed*.  I'm more likely to use it at night because it's just so thick.  #3 - There is some mild fragrance here, so if that's not your jam, look elsewhere.  #4 - This product is very expensive, and there are cheaper alternatives on the market.  With that said, I am going to be repurchasing this product as soon as my container is completely used up.  I really liked the product that much.  For the record, I have normal-combination skin that tends towards oily in the summer and tends towards dry in the winter.  I don't have overly-sensitive skin, but I'm susceptible to sensitivity with some products, like vitamin C.  I don't break out much, only a bit of hormonal acne, but I do have enlarged pores.  This product has not irritated my skin, but again, it doesn't provide much hydration, so I will often layer this on top of a lighter hydrating gel-cream.  It layers well, if the hydrating moisturizer you use is very light."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,"So far, so Great!","I received three small modules samples with my past order. I'm on  my second module sample and I'm in Love. 

I'm in my late 40s, have dry, eczema and sensitive prone skin. I don't have too many winkles, but a product like this, won't hurt!

When I tried it the first night, I could tell immediately that my face felt smoother and literally cleared my dry skin patch that I had on my forehead. Today is my fourth day that I've used this sample and I'm addicted already. I've already made up in my mind that I'm investing in this. Yes, it's expensive but it's worth it...shoot, I'm worth it! Phenomenal product!!!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,It's okay? Maybe better for dry skin?,"Wanted to like this, sounds very interesting, a product to help defend against blue light and pollution, but hard to know if it works. With that said, I love the smell, it was very light and pleasant, sort of like fruit punch? The texture is waxy sort of like a buttery lip balm, and this is filled with silicones and wax, which I'm not sure I like for my moisturizing cream. Maybe it's good for daytime to use almost like a primer before make-up, but for my normal/combo skin, I used this at night only--way too thick for daytime for me. I just didn't find this to really agree with my skin, didn't like that I woke up feeling a little greasy and oily. Also, I'm not really sure what's justifying the high price. For something moisturizing with peptides and ceramides to help restore the skin barrier, I've got other products I like better. Don't get me wrong, I love Peter Thomas Roth. I use the Pumpkin Enzyme Mask and the Water Drench Cream and LOVE them both so much, but this just isn't for me."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"This was ok. I live in Denver, where the climate is very dry, and this just didn’t do enough for my thirsty skin. Especially for the price, I just didn’t think it was worth it."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"Fantastic for my dry skin. I do not wear makeup, 50 years old with no major skin issues. I Clean my face with Cerave, Use my First Aid Beauty Glycolic pad, follwed by The Ordinary  Buffet then top it off with my PTR, warm it up in my fingers and apply. Makes my skin feel hydrated and so good. I can not tell you how many people tell me they can not believe I'm 50 and hope they have my skin at that age."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,just ok,I also received the sample - for some reason it made my skin very bumpy so I would not repurchase.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,Best thing I’ve ever put on my face. Fragrance free and completely noticed my skin was brighter and more plump. It even cleared my skin
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Your BFF if you have barrier issues,"I received this as a sample initially and I'm almost done with my 2nd full size in 6 months.  You only need a small amount.  The directions say to warm in your hands first, but I don't really need to do this because I have a couple serums I use first that make spreading this afterwards a dream.  This product works well to protect you if you're doing an intensive treatment like a professional strength peel or prescription retinoid.  When I've made my skin barrier unhappy, I use a B5 serum, a Q10 serum, a niamiacide serum, and then this over it.  My skin will be happy again in no time.  True story:. I gave my sister a few mask samples and told her a do at least 2 masks a day to to pamper myself during covid.  She used the one mask twice in one day that says to only use twice a week maximum.  She screwed up her barrier.  It look wind burned and everything she tried to use burned or made no difference. I gave her this product and the dream oil from Youth to the People.  She felt immediate relief.  She now uses this product religiously."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Love this,Great moisturizer for my 65 yr old skin. Provides moisture all day and has helped to brighten my complexion. Just as good as his microbiome eye balm.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Love It!,"Really loved this moisturizer and because it is a thicker cream, it is perfect for the wintertime. My skin feels so refreshed after using this and it also works well with my makeup. Perfect for both day use and also as a night cream!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,surprisingly effective!!!,"I had a sample of this and used it two evenings in a row, and I found it to work incredibly well. Woke up with moisturized, soft skin! I think that perhaps my skin needed something gentle with the various other products that I use."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Will be purchasing full size!,"The samples felt great on my skin, but not enough for me to notice a difference. I will need to purchase the full size and report back. So far, it felt great on my skin."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I used my rewards points for the sample of this cream and I am 100% purchasing it! I became obsessed after the first use and continued to use it every day until the sample was gone. I loved how thick it was, I really felt the moisture going deep into my skin! I didn’t find it cakey, although the texture does seem weird at first. once I blended it into my skin I didn’t notice the cakey-ness."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"amazing for red skin, sensitive skin, or rosacea. the complaints about the consistency are missing the point. The consistency is an indication that there are actually active ingredients."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Shockingly Good,"I got the sample pack, and LOVED it. Like truly blew my mind how hydrated and soft my skin was after using it on and off for a week. I think the people who left bad reviews might have gotten a bad batch if they were dried out. But I am satisfied enough to pay for the full size"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,trial size doesn’t do it justice,"I’m in love with this product! I tried the trial size 1st, and I did find as with some other reviews that it was difficult to work the product into a consistency that would spread across my face. However, I believe that the product begins to create a shield around itself that makes the outer edge a little bit harder. Once I broke through that on the full-size product, the product underneath the original film was a lot easier to work together. Regardless, whether you have the harder outer shell or the softer product underneath, this has become an essential step in my beauty routine.

I put it on instead of moisturizer after my serum. I feel like the product does moisturize and does absorb into my skin while also providing a layer of protection and shield against the world and even a good base for my make up primer. Since I’ve been using this product, my make up looks better and my skin (without make up) looks better. What more can I ask for? It feels protected, moisturized, and I see less of the types of signs you see from stressed out skin (redness, fine lines, dullness, dark spots). All around one of my favorite steps in my morning skincare routine. 

Don’t judge it by the Trial size. My advice? Splurge on the full, and return it if you’re not happy."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,does it really work!?,"I used my points to get the sample and a little goes a long way. its better to pat the product into the skin versus rubbing it in. what I've notice from one time use it that the cream definitely fills in the fine lines, definitely going to have to use the product for a while longer to see if it actually works! til next time!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Great Sample - I will be buying full size!,"I received a sample of this and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it.  Yes it is cakey as some other reviewers noted, but it is like butter.  You need to rub it in.  My skin looks INSTANTLY better, smoother, healthier and feels great.  I had been using a skin lightening serum from Murad (which works great by the way!) but was worried I had taken too much top layer protection away.  This sample was the perfect solution.  put this on in the AM, and can do the lightening serum in the PM."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Cakey and not easy to apply,I used my rewards points to sample this product. I love every other PTR product. This fell way below my expectations. Not creamy or easy to apply. I followed the instructions and warmed the cream in my palms and it was still cakey and uneasy to apply.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,This smells like big red gum. Made my face red. Over priced. It’s a no from me dog.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Will not be purchasing,I received this as a sample using my rewards points  .  I just wasted 100 points . This is cumbersome to apply on the face . It doesn't spread easily. It feels like a dried up waxy material you would be pulling and tugging your face to apply it.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,PTR vital-e Microbiome age defense cream,i got this as a 100 point perk they give you these 3 piece samplers which was nice I use this at night after removing all my makeup the texture is rich and feel tacky but your skin looks so much better and it is very hydrating. I feel like it makes your skin look younger when used daily.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"Ive been using this Peter Thomas Roth VITAL-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream and VITAL-E Microbiome Age Defense Face and Eye Cream for about a month now, and I am impressed! The texture is balm-like, and its unlike any moisturizer Ive used before. My skin was brighter in under 2 weeks! I received these products complimentary for testing purposes from @influenster. #MeetYourMicrobiome #contest #complimentary @PeterThomasRothOfficial @influenster"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"Ive been using this cream since getting it in my Influenster box, I must say my skin has been break free, smoother, softer, and feels less dry since starting this product. I really like this moisturizer so I give this"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I love this face cream. It has a buttery texture but melts in your fingertips and instantly absorbs into your skin. Not greasy at all. Lovely light scent and slight cooling effect. Makeup goes on smoothly after use, with no issues. Beautiful packaging. I would recommend !"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"A lifetime of sun seeking, hard work, & travel is starting to take a toll on my skin, and taking better care of it is one of my goals for 2020. So when I was recently given the opportunity to test @PeterThomasRothOfficial Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream, it could not have come at a better time!  I am 10 days in using my Vital-E and I am loving the results. My skin feels softer and firmer, looks less dull, and my fine lines are less visible. The texture is amazing- it goes on smoothly, is non-greasy, and make me feel amazing. Its giving me a confidence boost and helping me start 2020 off right!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I love this stuff! The texture is a dream on the skin. Once warmed up it just melts into the skin and is very easy to apply. It feels like it really sinks into the skin, afterwards my face felt and looked moisturized, without looking overly shiny when I use oils. My skin looks healthier and glows, but again not in an overtly shiny way. I do think this fights fine lines, it makes my skin look a little more plumped up and hydrated and just overall more healthy. Im curious to see what continuous use will do"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,Ive been using this for about 15 days now and see a significant improvement in the appearance of my skin. It feels softer and brighter-especially without makeup! I would definitely recommend this for normal to oily skin types. It feels light and moisturizing!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I feel like this moisturizer felt great on my skin, though at first felt a little heavy and thick. It did soak in a few mins after. Also smells great."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,I love the texture of this balm texture cream that keeps my skin moisturized all day long
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"It is fragrance free, melts into your skin like butter, and helps hydrate my skin without feeling greasy. And the icing on the cake...it has antioxidants, pre and probiotics for your skin."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I love how this feel on my skin. It is a bit thick, but its perfect for my nighttime routine. I especially love that it protects my skin from pollution and the blue light. I definitely recommend this product."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I like this cream, as aging and environmental stressors on my skin are starting to be a concern to me. The cream is thicker than any product Ive ever used and goes on as such. Like others, I did notice an increase in breakouts. I would use this primarily at night, rather than in the morning. It is a very luxurious-feeling product and smells nice. I am a fan of PTR, and I will use a bit longer to see if I notice more results."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I really liked this product. Its thick and goes on smoothly. The scent is not too potent or overpowering. I think it kept my skin moisturized. I am not sure how much is defended against age, but my skin is definitely not dry. @Influenster"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,Loooove this stuff!! Im in my early 30s so Im all about anti-aging. The smell is nice and light. The texture is creamy and thick. You only need a little because the formula melts into your skin. I totally recommend this especially if youre looking for something for those fine lines. Mine were less noticeable in just 2 weeks
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I got this along with the eye cream in a more recent VoxBox, and actually really liked it! The container is very cute. It's in the same shape as others in different lines of the skincare so it looks uniformed, but is in a fun slightly salmon pink color. The box it came in does make claims that I feel are a little overtop regarding performance. It doesn't effect the product itself, but I did want to mention that because it does kind of bug me a little. Sensationalizing something comes off inauthentic to me, and it actually makes me less likely to purchase a product. The cream is good and should speaks for itself. This is a solid cream, so the consistency kind of reminds me of a solid deodorant if that makes sense? I needed to work it with my fingers make it soft enough to apply evenly over my face without skin tugging. I really this because I travel a lot and don't have to be concerned about it leaking. I'm someone who doesn't mind fragrances when it comes to skincare, but they don't add any benefits to skin itself, so I appreciate that this is fragrance free for those who avoid that. I don't have visible signs of aging, but use these kind of product as a preventive measure, so I can't comment on how well it works in that regard. What I can say is that it left my skin very well hydrated, and gave it a firmer feeling. I don't like using this during the day when I decide to wear makeup because it is a bit thick, but I love it for my evening routine. That is just a matter of personal preference though. Overall, I had a very positive experience and definitely approve.FULL DISCLOSURE. I want to reiterate that this was sent in a  VoxBox. However, whether a product is gifted or personally purchased myself, I always give my honest feedback."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I received this product in a recent vox box from Influenster and to be completely honest I wasnt super thrilled at first. i felt like the cream never fully absorbed into my skin leaving it feeling greasy, which I cant stand! However after experimenting with the amount I was using, I found that less is definitely more when it comes to how much of the cream you use each time, trust me when I say a little goes a LONG way! The cream starts out very firm in the container and then softens/begins to melt as soon as it come
Into contact with your skin. I have noticed after just a few weeks of use that my skin feels hydrated and looks brighter. I will continue using it to see if these effects continue to improve!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,Amazing product I got from Influenster and this Peter Thomas Roth is worth it and I will be using it on a regular basis
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,After using this product consistently I can honestly say Im in love with it. I had really bad hormonal acne and I was using this along with acne treatments & within 3 weeks my face was clearing up on its own. I love this stuff so much!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,I love the texture of this product. It looks like a balm but goes on silky like a serum. I definitely feel like my skin is alot smoother after using this. I wear it during the day mostly for environmental protection and I feel like it's working pretty well so far!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"Is it a cream or an oil? I haven't figured that part out yet - but I do leave it in my car and when I apply it to my face in the morning while driving to work, I love how as soon as it hits my face it's nice and cool and then turns into a slippery oil that quickly absorbs. My skin is glowy, but not oily/shiny. It's super moisturized and I feel like I'm doing something good for my skin because it also has ""blue light"" protection and I sit in front of a computer for 12+hrs a day at work."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"This cream is a dream!!! I just had a baby, on top of living in a very dry and cold climate, which has been disastrous for my skin.  This cream is so incredibly moisturizing, and has worked wonders on all my fine lines and wrinkles.  Seriously, my forehead lines became really prominent during and after pregnancy, and this has made them significantly less noticeable."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"This is a great and unique cream, at the beginning could be weird but as soon as You warm the cream between your fingers It melts beautifully. It is a thick cream but without the oily after feeling. It moisturize my skin during the day perfectly and works well under my makeup."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I was not expecting the buttery creamy feeling of the cream and at the same time, it felt amazing putting it on. My skin feels amazing, tighter healthier i truly love this cream."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,I cant wait for you guys to try this product . I have tried it for a couple of week already . I can hobekty say my eyes started to look a bit different from when I took my before and after . I will be purchasing this product to keep my eye defense taking care and have a face of glow . I would recommend is a bit price it but I pay the price for something that is going to help me take care of myself. I received this product as a free sample thanks a lot @influenster [product:peter-thomas-roth-vital-e-microbiome-age-defense-cream][product:peter-thomas-roth-vital-e-microbiome-age-defense-eye-cream]
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Nice overnight hydration,"I received this as a sample, but I will definitely be buying it. I like a heavy moisturizer for overnight. I usually like Tatcha, but I think I'll try this one out for a while. It has a heavy, buttery texture that melts when rubbed in. Hydration lasts all night."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,There’s better moisturizer to choose from,"I would recommend this as a night moisturizer only as it is very thick and for me, the moisturizer left a sticky feel to my skin as if it did not absorbed completely. I didn’t notice any smell after applying. The texture did not bother me, it’s different but manageable. I did received this as a sample from an online purchase. Which I am happy I tried out the sample first before buying this moisturizer. Honestly, it’s not worth $75 to me."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,My skin feels velvety smooth,"I first tried this as a sample.  I was hooked after the first application.  It goes on smoothly and has a matte appearance.  Greasiness is my biggest complaint about moisterizers and this doesn't have a hint of greasiness to it.  A little bit goes a long way (I think I made the two samples last 8-10 days).  As long as you apply judiciously over 1-2 serums (which you've applied judiciously), it doesn't pill.  I use the highlighter over it, then a BB cream.  My face has never felt or looked better."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Great for computer using people,I bought this as a recommendation from a Sephora salesperson and so far it works for me. The moisture it gives is great but the protection from the blue rays of my computer screen is the reason I got it. I would buy this product again!!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,"nice texture, protects my skin, & smooth face","Right now I am in love with PTR and this product. I smoke (yeah yeah I know...) and I’m very concerned about creating some barrier between the air toxins and my skin. I love the texture so smooth and almost mattifying. It’s heavy enough I feel it and am hydrated, but light enough that it doesn’t make me sweat or breakout. I have dry skin so I couple it with a PTR hyloronic acid moisturizer and I’m set!!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,TLDR: it’s not worth the price,"While I do enjoy using this product, it does not deliver enough to justify a $75 price tag. I bought this during the spring sale after I tried a sample and liked it. The texture is unusual but I enjoyed using it and found it easy to spread. Also was moisturizing without making me greasy. I felt it made my skin look brighter as well, like it was glowing. So I only use it when I don’t have time to layer multiple products. However, I get more anti-aging payoff for much less using a mixture of products from The Ordinary. Olay Total Effects gives  me the same glow for way cheaper when I need to save time. The quantity of product you receive in this is also not worth the amount you pay. I would rather shell out the hefty price tag for Lancôme’s genefique anti-aging serum for the probiotic benefits than repurchase this cream. I actually think 2 stars is a more fair rating for this but I gave it 3 because I didn’t exactly hate this product, it’s just not worth the price tag at all."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,I wanted to love this,I really wanted to love this cream as I have been searching for the perfect daily cream. I don't know if this has happened to anyone else but when I melt it between my fingertips it actually almost feels very watery going onto my skin. It also makes my skin look more red and irritated then normal! Super strange. Maybe just not right for me!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,I wanted to love this but with the texture of it I went through the container entirely too quickly. A lot of product is needed to adequately moisturize and I don’t have $75 every 3-4 weeks to replenish.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Not worth the price,"This product claims to do a lot and I am skeptical about all of its claims. I appreciate that the company did their own clinical trial testing, which you can see on its site but I still don't fully understand how it protects against/diminishes the effects of blue light pollution. As most reviews have stated, it starts off as a solid and requires more than usual massaging between the fingers to get it to a moisturizer consistency. I didn't mind it, but it did feel like it sat on my skin vs. fully absorbing. There is a slight scent, which I did not mind. I had high hopes for this product, but it did not deliver on its promises for my skin, especially for the price."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I received a sample of this cream and loved it. It is indeed thick and waxy, but I like it’s feel."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"Wanted to love it. Very waxy.. like a primer.
I really dont care for it."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I hate to hate this cream.  I warm it up between my hands before application.  However, I can never get this cream to absorb.  It sits on top of the skin.  It may act as a great barrier, but feels strange on the skin."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,LOVE for my rosacea!!,"I first experienced this product as part of the skin care prep before my makeover at Sephora. I have very fair skin that is sensitive and red. This worked amazingly well immediately! Literally immediately after she applied it, my skin looked soothed, smoother, and less red. It’s not cheap though so I waited a while before purchasing, but it’s well worth the cost imo. You need very little of the product and it does a great job locking in moisture. Will purchase again!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Excited but sadly disappointed.,My blackheads on my nose were non existent. Loved that! But it wasn’t hydrating at all and burned my skin. Started to make my skin more red than when I first used it.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"Cream has a weird texture and does not spread. And if you do spread it enough, there’s a film on your face."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Great for Urban Dwellers!,"With anti-pollution and anti-blue light properties, this is perfect for urban commuters. It's a heavy consistency, which I love because my skin feels as plump at 8 PM as it did at 8 AM."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,GREASY and EXPENSIVE - worth the benefit?,"I was talked into this product by a sales rep for PTR. I cannot say whether it works or not (anti aging, etc), but I hate the feel on my skin. I feel so greasy, and I cannot wait to wash it off. I do not know if I will be able to stick it out to see the results, but it was so expensive, so I feel like I have to try! Go for a less expensive option first."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I used this for a month, no difference seen on my skin. The only thing I liked was it didn’t feel greasy, absorbs good, and it’s like a primer for your make up. It has wax in it. No other benefits. :/"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Wonderful!,I love this product! It has smoothed my wrinkles and corrected so many issues for me! It does not make me break out and really sinks into my skin. My skin is prepped and ready for makeup. I love how it melts into my skin.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I wanted to like this but I didn’t find it very moisturizing for my skin, and I had to use a lot of product to get the same coverage as other moisturizers. I don’t think it’s bad product, and I love PTR products, but this just wasn’t for me."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,Feels great; no obnoxious scent; rich n creamy... I just tried it for the first time and I really enjoy this product more than the vitamin c one with the horrible scent... this one has almost no scent so very ready to utilize... so far I highly  recommend this product
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,love it BUT why no tool included??,"I loveeeee this cream, the only reason I’m giving it four stars is cause PTR has the nerve to charge 75 bucks for a cream and not even include a tool to scoop it out with. like are y’all serious. plus I’m an add I saw a little scooper so I was expecting it to come with cream. hella disappointed BUT I still live this cream to death. will just use an old tatcha tool"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Buh-Bye Blue Light damage!,"Blue light damage be gone! Who doesn’t need some help protecting their skin from blue light these days? I personally am exposed to it most of the day due to work so this product definitely made me giddy! The texture is nice and creamy while still being light weight and airy. The smell is 10/10 and like you just walked into a Michael’s at the start of Fall! It’s cruelty free, vegan, made with amazing and guilt free ingredients. And as if all of that isn’t great enough, the moisturize itself helps to repair our skins barrier and the damage done to it and our microbiome! The result is beautiful, glowly skin that smells amazing and leaves you feeling younger and rejevunated! I just would use caution if you have ultra sensitive skin! I do and when I was using the product twice daily like recommended it did irritated my skin but that’s really more just about my sensitive skin and less about the cream. So I did have to just scale it back to using it a few times a week and still saw great results!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I LOVE this cream! When I first got it I didn’t reach for it that much because I am obsessed with the water drench from PTR, but I ran out one day and used this one for a few days before getting to a Sephora. WoW! I was missing out, it kept my skin looking good all day and at night when I did my night routine I’d be amazed how nice my skin felt after washing off my sunscreen. A+ PTR. Noticed a lot of differences! Skip the eye cream version I’d say, this does it all!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,My experience,"My skin often goes from too oily to very dry within days. My skin sometimes takes weeks for a blemish to disappear. I have only used for about two weeks now, but I feel like it has really started to help my skin balance out.( I also use the mega Rich anti aging creme) my skin it’s starting to not look as dull and fine lines around my eyes and temples are not gone but look not as noticeable.I’ve cut back on about 3 products I was using to just try to maintain my face. I’m still looking for what a long term usage will entail , but I have only had a positive experience so far."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Applies like a dream,I really enjoyed this moisturizer for my dry sensitive skin. The moose like formula applies more a gel and sinks in really quickly. It didn’t clog my pores or give me any breakouts. My face felt very moisturized but not greasy.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,This product is nice and moisturizes your face. I like the texture as well. The only thing for me is the moisturization doesn’t last very long. When I wake up in the morning my face is still very dry. I don’t think this is a good match for me but I’m sure it’ll work great for others. I was lucky to receive this product from influencer to try This product is nice and moisturizes your face. I like the texture as well. The only thing for me is the moisturization doesn’t last very long. When I wake up in the morning my face is still very dry. I don’t think this is a good match for me but I’m sure it’ll work great for others. I was lucky to receive this product from influencer to try.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,New anti aging product.,After receiving this complimentary for review purposes I am happy to recommend this product to someone that is concerned with the outside elements we are exposed to on the daily. After melting the product between my fingertips it applies smoothly and looks great underneath my makeup. I can see a difference in my forehead and overall my skin feels hydrated.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,miracle in a jar,After using drunk elephant for a month my skin felt like a crocodile. I bought this a week ago and my skin is so soft and moisturized. I absolutely love this stuff!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I’m a product junkie and haven’t really found many products that I stick to long term, but this... this is honestly one of those face creams that helped my skin and I can’t stop using it. I have a fine line on my forehead and it’s almost gone now. My face feels like velvet and it doesn’t make me break out, in fact my constant chin acne hasn’t flared up since I started using this. It has a very gentle and unobtrusive scent, you need very little product to moisturize your whole face and it plays well with my other products - like my makeup, serums, etc. I think I finally found my long term moisturizer."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,love it!,I really love this product! I’ve been using it for some weeks and I really see some differences! Got the first time a product that works!!! I received this product for free for testing purposes.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,I love this product like most PTR products this did not disappoint. I saw immediate results. The lines under my eyes have mostly disappeared. Most eye products make my eyes swell because of certain ingredients this has done very well no issues. I am so happy I have finally found a good under eye product that works. This is definitely worth the price.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Breakout,Had a lot of breakout with the use of this product
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Super Thick,"I like thick but I also like pliable, you have to really heat this up to be able to get it all over. I was thinking about using my hair dryer to try to soften it up. I'm glad I didn't get the eye cream or I would be pulling on tender eye area. I will try hitting it with some heat to make it easier to spread. It's Pink and doesn't stink so that's a plus, it won't go to waste. Times like these samples are a god sent, I wish I would of had one. PTR products are good stuff all in all."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Moisturizer that lasts,I love how this cream is firm in texture and then becomes applicable when you take it out of the jar. It leaves my skin feeling moisturizer and not greasy. I use a mini makeup spatula with my cream.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Magical Melting Water Butter Cream = Perfection!,"This is one of the most unique and magical creams I have ever tried, completely in awe of! Initially the texture is similar to a balm and appears to be more on the firm side. I scoop onto my fingers then gently massage into my skin... This is when the magic happens! With the warmth of my skin the cream instantly just melts into my skin. It almost feels like water but a more buttery water like texture, so hydrating and moisturizing. It feels like a hybrid between a water cream and a body butter, yet not too thick but not too thin either. Water creams tend to leave my skin wanting more, and thick creams tend to be too heavy. The Vital-E cream is the best of both worlds and perfect for my 42 yo combination skin. Perfect for my nighttime routine to lock everything in for recovery sleep mode. This is one of the first Peter Thomas Roth products I’ve tried and I am impressed!!! Such a standout moisturizing cream for me. My favorite nighttime cream is DE’s LaLa Retro Whipped, and this one is right up there with it."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Great Moisturizer,"I love Peter Thomas Roth products and this one is no exception. I love the creamy feel of this moisturizer, it definitely feels hydrating but without being heavy or greasy. My skin appears brighter and smoother after just a couple weeks of use."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,I received this in a Vox Box along with the Eye cream. I must admit i was hesitant to use it at first as i have my trusted skin care line that I've used for years. But!! I absolutely loved this product. My skin has been feeling softer after almost 4 weeks of using the age defense cream! I love my smoother complex.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Dreamy texture,"I love this stuff! The texture is a dream on the skin. Once warmed up it just melts into the skin and is very easy to apply. It feels like it really sinks into the skin, afterwards my face felt and looked moisturized, without looking overly shiny when I use oils. My skin looks healthier and glows, but again not in an overtly shiny way. I do think this fights fine lines, it makes my skin look a little more plumped up and hydrated and just overall more healthy. I’m curious to see what continuous use will do."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Too rich for me,"This face cream was too rich for my skin type that I’d immediately wake up the next day with a new white head each evening used. Testing it out for daytime use, I was an immediate grease ball. This is probably best for mature skin but due to the product’s texture and consistency, it’s the application that would  drag and pull the skin, something to keep in mind. It cream was more balm or pomade like that you’d need to work in the fingertips first but even then, in my mid 30s skin, there was some tugging and pulling for the application itself. 

I received this product for free for my honest review."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,I love this product! It didn't have a scent which I'm a big fan of. I didn't need to use alot of product to get results and my skin absorbed it really well.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I have been using this product for about a month now and I absolutely love it, I use the eye cream that matches around my eye area and use this on the rest of my face and neck. It makes my skin feel so incredibly smooth. It’s been my go to, since I started using it. I highly recommend"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"Loved the smooth texture and the light delicate scent. I noticed improvement in fine lines, and dryness within 3 weeks of trying the Age Defense Cream.  I received the product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Hydrating Blue Light Protector,"This eye cream was a gift for review, from @Peterthomasrothofficial and @Influenster #voxbox and is being reviewed as part of a set. This eye cream applies smooth and you do not need much at all. It does not migrate toward your eyes or lashes, and absorbs quickly. The texture is smooth and buttery. It is a product that starts as a solid, you warm it in-between your ring get tips and then it liquifies and “activates” all the much needed properties. That part is a little tricky, but there is a video online showing you how. The appearance of my under eye area and fine lines/crows feet is dramatically improved. Lines are almost invisible, and it softens and brightens the area. It’s very hydrating and has a luxurious feel to it. You do receive your money’s worth for this product, the vial is large and lasts a long time. I used it am and pm for my results. It isn’t harsh or burning to the sensitive eye area. You do have to leave it absorb and dry before applying any concealer. It blends well with the Vital-E moisturizer, so you should try them together! My skin is loving this!!! I will be purchasing this again."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Pretty solid!,"I'm really enjoying this product. At first the texture threw me off I was worried it would be too thick and greasy but it melts into a very nice creamy texture. Overall I think it's a solid everyday moisturizer, especially for those who have dry skin. But I knock it one star because I haven't seen any significant results outside of it being super moisturizing. Being in my 30s now I really need workhorse products to fight aging."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,Great texture the easily dissolves.  I like the consistency and I don’t have to worry about a mess when I travel.   My skin  really enjoys it and it will last a long time
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"I love the consistency of this cream. Very thick, yet not oily at all. Loved it . Worth the price"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Phenomenal Addition to my Skincare Regimen,"I saw an instant difference in my skin tone— in that it appeared much more even. I also loved the way it felt like a rich moisturizer without feeling like it was clogging my pores. I have sensitive skin, and I didn’t have any reactions at all."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Love this product!,"First of all, the packaging is something that makes me smile every morning and night when I apply the product. I love the vibrant pink that's used. The consistency of the product is also very rich and lux feeling. Overall, this is a wonderful product and has really benefitted my skin this winter season with increased moisture and skin firmness."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,I’m glowing!!,"This cream made my skin glow. The texture took some getting used to but once on my face, it felt luxurious. The scent is light and doesn’t overpower. I can see a reduction in fine lines since using this cream."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,I’ve been using this product for a few weeks and definitely notice an improvement in my skin and have been having less breakouts.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Emulsifying beauty!,"Did like the moisturizer, I only used it at night because there is no spf. Skin did feel smooth and hydrated. Warm the moisturizer up in your hands first then apply."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,This is the BEST!,"I’m obsessed with this product! I love the whipped, luxurious texture and how smooth it goes on my skin. Prior to using, I had some redness and texture concerns on my face. Literally after a few days I could immediately tell a difference and now my skin is flawless! Such a great product!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Vital-E Microbiome Age Defense Cream,"This is very hard to dig out. I didnt want to contaminate it so I bought a bunch of little tiny spatulas. those work perfect digging out the product. But once you get it out and warmed up it feels so nourishing going onto your face. Its creamy, thick, and light at the same time. I recieved this as a gift in exchange for a review and I waited till I've used it for a month consistently. My skin feels great while this has been in my skin care routine."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,fresh and dewy,I typically have oily t zone and very dry in the winter.  This water gel moisturizer has hydrated my face and kept my skin fresh looking. Love it.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,Singapore,Ms,"It’s nice but the smell is not so strong like before. I prefer the previous lavender smell though. However, the tube seems to hv more now, it’s fuller to the feel. Overall this is a great product. It’s really good for my sensitive skin which can’t take anything oily or thick."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Love it but tube size is too small,"I love this stuff! The scent is lavender and is so relaxing. The consistency starts off as a gel when you squeeze it into your hand, but as soon as you rub your hands together or rub it on your face it turns into a more watery consistency. Still very hydrating. 

Removing 1 star because the bottle is really small but yet the price point is still expensive… for that reason I won’t be repurchasing."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,Canada,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,"*returned* before purchase i read in comments that it is really small, but i was still surprised about how small it is lol. i dont find anything special about it, so returned."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,Canada,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,I love this but it's overpriced. I really wish it was twice the size
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,It worked!,My skin feels fully hydrated the whole day! This product is great.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Best summer moisturizer for oily skin,"One of the best moisturizers for summer time. It makes your skin relaxed, and hydrated. I have oily skin, and get clogged pores easily. I use this, along with their precleansing oil and have noticed a change in my skin."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,Singapore,Best Moisturizer,This is the only moisturizer that works on me. I have a very sensitive skin and easily breaks out. With this moisturizer it really suits my skin. Its expensive cos it's only 50ml but it's worth a try.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,Canada,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,I’m obsessed with this moisturizer!! Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth and very hydrating! The smell is also amazing I would definitely recommend this
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,Smells good and will not make you break out. Lightweight and super hydrating.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Hello Hydration!!!!,This is my go to product for daily hydration and plumping! Calming Cactus Pear to soothe irritation if you are sensitive and hyaluronic acid to lock in moisture! A delicious drink of water for your skin! A must have!
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,Best purchase ever !!! You can see the difference in your skin within days .. my acne was so bad and in few days it improved a lot
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,Canada,Absolutely Lovely Moisturizer,"Super nice to put on and it absorbs into my skin like a dream! I only need a pea-sized amount for my whole face, and it feels nice and cool, with the faintest, gentlest scent of essential oil that fades away in seconds once it's on my skin. 

I kind of wish it was a bit stronger, just a tiny bit, since my nose and upper cheeks tend to be super-dry in the winter time(I end up using a bit of the Prism Shield moisturizing lotion from Dermalogica as a booster instead of just the Calm Water Gel), but every other time of the year it's a perfect moisturizer for me!"
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,"I get the feeling I would have liked this product a lot (A LOT) more during summer. Seeing as it was November when I purchased & tried it, though, I was unimpressed.

I first tried the product with my usual regimen of skincare. But something about the product didn’t mesh well with the essence & serum I’m using (the artemisia line from Missha), & it felt almost plasticky on my skin. Almost like the yellow gel moisturizer from Clinique I used when I was younger. 

So I tried a more simplified regimen, leaving out my extra steps of essence, serum, & emulsion (from Laneige). Unfortunately, while this product felt good applying, it wasn’t hydrating enough for my cheeks (& the dryer parts of my face) & my skin felt a lil tight about 30-60 min later. A few hrs after which my skin started feeling oily to compensate for the dryness.

That said, i do have extremely sensitive skin, yet this didn’t break me out or give me burns/rashes. I’m willing to try it again when summer months come around. It’s just not worth the price, imo, during winter."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,The best,I loved this moisturizer it was perfect for my skin because I’m dry skin and my face felt amazing after that todally recomended and forsure super ref feeling after using it love it
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Amazing!!!,"This is one of the best moisturizers that I've ever used! I have very dry and sensitive skin, especially more so during fall/winter. It is very lightweight and super hydrating for my skin. One major pro is that is does not irritate my sensitive skin! I would definitely recommend this product!"
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,"I have super temperamental skin. I've tried a ton of different moisturizers, and either they're too heavy or dry out my skin, or, most commonly, cause a reaction. This moisturizer is super light and probably one of two on this earth that doesn't cause a disastrous reaction on my face. Cannot recommend this enough."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Great Moisturizer!,It is such a hydrating moisturizer! Very gentle and feels silky on my skin.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Must have!,This is a great product for those with sensitive dry skin. I rarely put anything on my face but this moisturizer is a must have. Very comfortable for day and night. Not oily. Perfect for those dry winter mornings when you need a lightweight refreshing lotion.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Calming Gel is Amazingly light,"Super smooth and silky feeling. Love the lavender smell, not overpowering. Would definitely recommend."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,Didn't really help with my dry skin. Felt it was really watery too and didn't like the application so much. I usually love dermalogic but wasn't a big fan of this one.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Absolutely Amazing,"I just love this moisturizer. First off, the scent of this moisturizer is absolutely amazing. I love the smell of it. I have really sensitive skin and I am also prone to getting eczema and this moisturizer works great for that. It never irritated my skin. I love how cool it feels on my skin every time I apply it. It quenches my skin. It feels like water and it hydrates my skin so amazingly well. My skin always feels so extra dry when the winter season is approaching. This moisturizer definitely does the job keeping my skin moisturized. The formulation is weightless. It feels like I have nothing on my face. I love applying this at night and in the morning my face always feels so hydrated, soft and smooth. I no longer suffer from dry patches on my face since I’ve been using this product. I don’t believe I’ve tried a product quite like this ever. I really can’t compare this moisturizer to anything on the beauty market right now. I’m definitely purchasing this product as soon as I run out. Ever since I got my hands on this, I’ve been raving and recommending it to all my friends."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Great hydrating moisturizer,I absolutely love this product! It applies so nicely and absorbs quickly into the skin. The lavender scent is so nice and calming as well. After using my skin is extremely soft and brighter. i would highly recommend this product!
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Calm Water Gel Moisturizer,"I received the Calm Water Gel Moisturizer to try out I already knee that I was going to love it. When I tried it I loved that it was a gel but I didn't like that it took so long to soak in, I've been noticing that after I use it my face hasn't been oily it does that with other moisturizers."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Good for sensitive skin!,This product is definitely calm and good for sensitive skin. I love how light weight it’s feel yet very moisturizing. Very minimal smell to this product which is a plus for me personal. I definitely recommend if you have sensitive skin
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Good,"Works really well, skin is always dry especially in this Washington cold, so it feels very moisturized now. Smells really nice as well!"
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,Such an amazing product. It really helped my face to be super clear.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,I received this product for free to review and have used it for the past few weeks. My skin has maintained hydration and not experienced breakouts from this moisturizer. The downsides are the presence of fragrance and the hefty price tag. I will not purchase in the future since I already have a moisturizer I love.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Awesome moisturizer!!!!,Love this moisturizer made my skin soft help my dry skin and great product.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,I love this product! I have sensitive skin and it does a great job of moisturizing my skin without being too oily or irritating. I will definitely continue to use this product.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Nice Moisturizer!,"A nice moisturizer that feels super watery. A little lighter than I’m used to because I have really dry skin but it still got the job done. However, there is a really strong scent that was super overpowering for me personally."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Fantastic Moisturizer!,This product was amazing. It was light weight which made it perfect for a day moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and most moisturizers make me break out but I had no problems at all with Dermalogica. I also don't have to use a lot of it which means that the product will last longer than what I typically buy. I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin who is looking for a light weight moisturizer.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Love it!!!,"I love how this felt on my skin, especially with how bad I’ve been breaking out with the mask mandate! left my skin feeling soft and healthy"
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Great Day to Day Moisture,Extremely moisturizing with a very pleasant simple fragrance. Dries a bit sticky and with a fine film. Lasts for hours. Don’t notice mush of a difference in skin long term but great for day to day moisture.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,"While this is by no means a bad product, it just doesn't work for my skin. I think this would be fantastic for someone with oily skin, for my dry skin it just didn't do enough and left my skin still feeling parched, which was uncomfortable."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,So calming!,"Love this product! Love the smell, love the feel, love the hydration. It’s the PERFECT product to apply at night, with the calming lavender aspects. It’s great for laying under heavier products. Would definitely recommend."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Great Moisturizer,This was great but super watery. There was also fragrance which I know some skin types react to. Otherwise it was super hydrating. It felt amazing on my skin.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,So good!,"Very light moisturizer. It immediately sinks in and you do really get that plumping feeling. I have very dry skin and I only needed a little bit to cover my face. No fragrance, which I love."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Great for Dry Skin,"I did in fact receive Dermatologica Calm Water Gel Moisturizer from BzzAgent for free to review *full disclosure*. That being said, its really nice for my particular skin concerns. My skin is quite dry and sensitive so I enjoy how this moisturizer not only hydrates, but also tones down the sheer amount of redness my irritable skin normally has."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,You Need This!,Love the product! I have dry and sensitive skin and this product worked great for me. There is no smell but I don't feel that it sinks into the skin. The best part is that after you apply it you're skin will look moisturized even if it isn't.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Nice!,Great moisturizer and feels luxurious. A little lighter than I’m used to because I have really dry skin but it still got the job done. I knocked off a star because there is a really strong scent. I usually don’t mind scents but since this one is strong it is a little overpowering.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,It does moisturize!,"I have dry skin that is irritated easily. I patted a small amount all over my face and neck on multiple occasions morning and night. It kept my face feeling soft and moisturized. It also gave a subtle glow, which did not last all day but was still appreciated. When I woke up my face did not feel dry. This did not cause pimples or itching. I was quite surprised at this products ability to moisturize my skin.  The ingredient list is relatively natural. This would be great for people with sensitive, oily skin as well because it's not thick. A little goes a long way."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Good,"I absolutely love this product, this is the second one I have received and lasted about a good 3-4 months. It applies smoothly on the face and feels good one your start rubbing it in. It brings a glow to your face after a few days uses."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Best moisturizer for dry skin!,Since the weather has been changing so much my skin has been getting super dry lately and this moisturizer has saved it! This instantly hydrated my skin and keeps it feeling super soft all day long.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,I really enjoyed trying this product out. I personally have dry skin so that fact that it is so moisturizing is wonderful and it not only keeps my face soft and glowing but also I have noticed a difference in my acne.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Great lightweight moisturizer for any skin type,"This is a great lightweight moisturizer for any skin type. I have dry, dehydrated skin from living in the desert, and my skin drinks this stuff up. I put this on at night because I enjoy the soothing lavender smell this has. Now I will say, if you are sensitive to fragrances, this does have a VERY STRONG lavender scent, so keep that in mind. I do wish that they toned down the scent a notch, but I can handle it so it doesn’t bother me too much. This has a great luxurious moisturizing feel initially, and then while rubbing into the skin turns into a mix of a lightweight serum/oil. The reason I knocked off a star was because of the very strong scent, and the fact that sometimes I don’t feel like this is enough moisture for my very dry skin. This is one I will probably prefer to use in the summer months when my skin isn’t as dry. As we are nearing the fall and winter months, this will be one I may have to set aside to transition into my heavier moisturizer. Overall, if you’re looking for a lightweight moisturizer and you don’t mind a strong lavender scent, try this out!"
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Great daily formula!,"I really enjoyed this moisturizer! As someone with very dry skin, the gel formula felt super hydrating and had a nice cooling effect, which is great for use to wake you up in the morning or to soothe the skin after a long day! It felt really good on the skin and I think it would be a great daily moisturizer to keep in your routine. It also smelled really nice, but not overpowering."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Very good moisturizer for skin on the oilier side!,"First, I want to say I love dermalogica products! I find them to work well with my sensitized skin. This moisturizer is no exception! The lavender in it is calming and I don’t end up with a bright red race when I put it on! It is very light though. I have really dry skin so this is a little too light for me with the winter months coming up. I think it would be great for summer or anyone that is more on the oilier side. It goes well under makeup and I didn’t have any issues with my skin being “peely” dry, I just prefer a heavier moisturizer (which is the reason I gave it 4 stars in stead of 5). I also want to note that a little does go a long way. I don’t have to use too much to cover my whole face and neck."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,This is good for normal skin type,"I really like the texture of this gel. My skin does feel hydrate and it Calms my skin to, But I can't say enough for my dry skin in winther, For an extra hydration, I add a couple drop of my serum.there are a lot of other products that are more hydrating that are less costly. I would not buy this again for $50.00."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Awesome product,I love this stuff. I get dry spots around my nose and mouth and I started using this and my skin was hydrated over night! And I only need to use a tiny little dot of it.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,No more dry skin,"I’ve always had dry skin, especially when I was younger struggled with it. Especially when it came to wearing make up. My skin would look flaky. DEFINITELY glad I was sent this product, cause my skin looks fantastic!"
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,My skin is super dry and this moisturizer is Giving it life!! My face is glowing and I’m here for it. I use it day and time. My husband also has dry skin and he loved it he said it relaxed him and he gives it also 5 stars.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,Great product! Made my skin look amazing and moisturized besides being really dry.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Amazing,I am glad I tried this water gel moisturizer out. It left my skin feeling really soft and made it look less dull. I enjoy the scent and a little goes a long way. Compared to other water gel moisturizers I have used because it actually showed real results.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Tone down the scent and it’s perfect,Great moisturizer ! Feels so amazing to put on your skin ! Not greasy or heavy at all. The only thing that I really didn’t like is the very pungent smell! Not that it smells bad ! It’s just very strong ! Way to strong to be around my facial/nose area haha.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Great product ❤️,"This water gel made my skin feels really good. After using it my skin is really soft and moisture❤️ really good, and it doesn’t mad my skin feel sticky. Great product!"
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Such a good moisturizer!,Such a lightweight and soothing moisturizer! I use it everyday and use it as a layer of primer underneath my makeup. I would recommend this to anyone with dry skin or oily skin.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,"I have dry to combo sensitive skin.  And  this does do everything it says.  It just wasn’t  the right moisture for my skin.  I haven’t used a gel moisturizer before.  And I found it didn’t absorb into my skin like a regular moisturizer which, left my skin feeling dry, which lead me to put on more, which would end up breaking me out.  It did give my skin a nice glow.  The Moisturizer didn’t burn or irritate my skin in the slightest. So not bad just not great."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,"I normally stay away from anything that’s a water gel because I’ve got really dry skin but I like this! I got the chance to try it for free and I’ve never had a moisturiser like this. It turns into literal water but it moisturises pretty decently and doesn’t leave my skin with that almost matte feeling that most water gel creams do, instead it feels like I used a regular lightweight cream."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,LOVE DERMALOGICA,"My favorite part of everything Dermalogica is that I trust them as a brand. Their products are all effective without being harsh, and my skin has loved everything I’ve tried. I typically prefer something thicker like skin smoothing cream or intensive moisture balance, but I love this for days I’m experiencing more irritation than usual or before going to the gym."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,"This product was made for my skin. My skin looks healthier and clearer than ever before. In seven days, the bumps on my face were fading away."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Worth a try,I have very dry skin and this gel works wonders! I love that it still keeps my skin feeling luscious. This is a product that I would definitely recommend to all of my friends! The gel feels great on my face and doesn’t feel stripping like other face products that I have tried in the past.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,This moisturizer is incredibly lightweight and I feel like it deeply penetrates my dried out pores and makes them refreshed. It gives me a great dewy and fresh look. I LOVE it and recommend it to everyone I know! I will be a lifetime buyer!!
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Love,"Love this water gel , leaves my face feeling amazing and not greasy. Pleasant scent and left me feeling clean and looking clear."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Great Moisturizer,"This product is honestly great. It's a super lightweight moisturizer but super hydrating at the same time. It feels nice and cooling on the face, and it didn't irritate my skin or make me break out. It worked great under my makeup and kept my face feeling nice and smooth throughout the day. I personally don't have anything negative to say about it, other than I think it's a bit pricey for the amount you get. If you have the money to spend, I'd definitely recommend it."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Love it!,"I love this stuff! I did receive this for free, however I was excited to try it because I heard such great things about dermalogica. I have dry and sensitive skin, and this product did not cause me any irritation or reactions, and my skin stayed hydrated. This product does have a scent, so I would suggest if you do not like scented facial products to not use this— but it is a light scent and not overpowering. I would definitely recommend!"
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Loved it,I love this it was very soft to skin and very easy to apply it left my skin feeling soft and gave me a great amount of moisture I have dry skin so this was very important to me and its great to apply before putting on makeup it gives that a vibrant glow and looks and looks very healthy loved it
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,New Favorite Moisturizer,"I really like the Calm Water Gel Moisturizer. I have really dry skin and this product helped prevent my dry skin from showing up and kept it very hydrated. I also enjoying the smell of this product, it has a slight lavender scent. The scent is just enough, not over powering at all. I mainly used this product at night and the lavender was perfect! I will definitely be purchasing this product again."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,"I hab never tried a gel formula before so I was a bit skeptical. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It goes on super smooth and keeps my face moisturized for a long time. I love how you don’t need to use a lot of product to get good results."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Gel for dry skin,I was honestly skeptical if this would work for me. I have very dry and slightly sensitive skin and gel formulas often irritate it but this one is somehow magic and does not. Truly the first gel formula I've ever used that didn't immediately turn my face bright red and cause the opposite reaction. After using this my skin was left feeling soft and soothed and it's made a great base for makeup. The benefit of the gel formula is it's lighter to use for the day time if layering products. I truly have been reaching for this daily and am shocked at how much I like it. I recommend it to anyone who wants a gel formula and normally can't tolerate them.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Love the subtle smell,"I would quite literally describe this moisturizer as feeling like a splash of water. It is very refreshing and the smell is not overpowering. I was weary about the lavender smell, but I am pleasantly surprised as the smell does not stick around after you rub it into the skin and it feels nice underneath my sunscreen and make up."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Dewy and nice.,"I was giving the dermatological gel as a free sample to try. In exchange for my honest review. I found this to be very hydrating for my aging dry skin. It is a gel formula which feels a little cold, but I really actually liked that a lot. It has a very neutral smell I did not find it to be strong at all. I did mix it in with my other skin care items and it seem to be a perfect fit. I will definitely buy this again and I would recommend it for people with dryer skin. The gel formula is quickly absorbed into the skin and leaves you with a nice do we finish."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Kinda oily,Very hydrating but I find that it’s left me greasy after ever use. Definitely not for combo or oily skin. Might be best used for a winter moisturizer
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Best for dry face,"I love this moisturizer. Ever since I gave birth I've had blotches of dry skin on my face, i started using the clam water gel moisturizer and it has made my whole face smooth and very moisturize which was what I needed once this is done i continue to buy."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Melts into your skin,"Love this moisturizer. This is more of a gel than it is cream, it's a see through formula. It glides on and easily melts into the face. I usually have bad reactions to skincare because my face is so sensitive, but I didn't react to this stuff! Will continue to use till it's empty."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,"Definitely makes your skin feel hydrated. However, it has an oily feel to it. Definitely only use a small amount at a time. Scent is pretty strong as well, which I don't find pleasant"
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Lightweight Gel Moisturizer,"I’ve been using this moisturizer every night for several weeks now, and I do feel that it’s a decent moisturizer. I love that the formula is very water like and a very little bit goes a long way. Seriously, start off with a small pea sized amount and you will be surprised how far that takes you. I loved the herbal scent, but I do know others would be put off by it - I much prefer it to the artificial smells some products have. I do feel that this product leaves my skin feeling moisturized, though I’d like to see how it’d perform in winter. My skin type is dry, but is moving towards combination as of late."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,I have suffered from dry skin the past couple years. Every product I’ve tried usually dries out my face more or causes server acne. This product was amazing. It was light in texture and didn’t leave a heavy feeling. The scent is pleasant and cleared up my dry skin within two weeks of use.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Logic,When I seen I was one of the lucky ones to receive complimentary I was excited. Received after a two week span. When I did get it the first thing I did was look the brand up I had no clue who they were. So my first impression it’s pricey cute packaging and love the expression “calm water “ and the fact that it is gel made me even more excited. When I opened it I immediately got a lotion scent but when I rubbed together it gave me a oat hospital lotion smell vibe not a bad thing but it threw me off a bit. I do like the texture of the gel it’s super soft and will have skin soft as  to me  it leaves a heavy sticky dewy feeling  though after you let sit. I like it for my hands and feet. My skin is combination oily dry with little acne to no acne.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Great,"The cream is so lightweight and smooth. I love how it is not too greasy and not too watery. However, the scent of it is not the best."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,"I seriously love this stuff! It smells so calming but not too strongly of Lavender, its light weight but does a great job at moisturizing my super dry skin. I use it as part of my morning routine right after my toner as sort of a serum and then put my slightly thicker moisturizer over it and my skin is so plump and hydrated all day! I will definitely be repurchasing as part of my on going skincare routine!"
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,I like this!,"Very lightweight but moisturizing! This is a great option for a summertime moisturizer for dry skin or would probably be good anytime on oily skin. I like that it glides on so smooth and absorbs quickly. 

I received this product complimentary from BzzAgent for testing purposes."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,I like it!,"I really like this product. Makes my skin feel nice, great quality. I got it for free, so I’m not sure if I would by it myself. But overall it’s a great product!"
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,"I was initially not expecting much with this demalogica gel moisturizer and it was my first time using it. I was extremely surprised when I first using it, left my face feeling moisturized throughout the day and I didn’t necessarily need to use it twice a day but I still did and my face has never felt better."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Very unique texture,"I am not a stranger to Dermalogica and love a lot of their other skincare products include their cult favorite Microfoliant. When I received this product, I was quite excited about its unique texture and formula. It has the appearance of a silicone-y primer initially. As you rub your hands together, the texture melts and becomes watery. It's quite strange! This  allows the product to spread very easily across the skin and a little does go a long way. Within about 30 seconds, the product fully absorbs into the skin and still leaves a ""satin-feel"" due to the silicone in this that helps to retain the moisture and hyaluronic acid. Within 1-2 minutes, it gets even further absorbed and that slippery feeling disappears. This is not oily nor greasy on the skin and it does not make my skin even more dry as the day goes on. I have very dry skin so I find that this works better for me in the daytime and is sufficient when I do my hydrating skincare regimen. I have not had any adverse reaction to this product, so that's a great point.

I docked one star because this is very strongly scented of Lavender. I personally am not offended or irritated by fragrance in skincare but I can see how others might be a bit more sensitive to the fragrance. Also, I don't foresee this being an all-in-on moisturizer for me for all seasons. It would only work best in the mornings and in spring/summer time. Overall, this to me is just a basic moisturizer with a very unique formula that I really enjoy. There are no groundbreaking clinical ingredients that are included that I feel justifies the somewhat high price tag (unless you can afford it!)"
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Good product,"I have really dry skin. Not a lot of products I use help me feel moisturized but I like this product because keeps my skin moisturized all day. Also, it great underneath makeup because it leaves the skin soft and smooth. The only think I don't like is that isn't fast absorbent. My sister try it and she loves it."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Not Good for Dry Skin,"My first complaint is that it smells like old lady products. It’s so hard to get over the smell as it’s very strong at least for me. Second, I live in a very dry climate with already dry skin so I guess my expectations are pretty high for a “moisturizer”; this would definitely not fly here for my skin. I understand it’s a gel, but I believe this product is supposed to be hydrating in some way? It’s more of a good thin layer to add under a cream, at least that’s what I did. I give it 2 stars for at least giving me some sort of layer."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,"recieved this product for review from bzzagent 
its a very nice moisterizer feels great and doesn't clog my sensitive skin"
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Great for adult acne,I love this moisturizer. I’ve been using dermalogica products for 2 years now and have always had a great experience. Recently I’ve been getting adult acne clusters and needed something calming for my sensitive skin. This WORKS!! A little goes a long way. I highly suggest using the calming serum before this moisturizer. They work together. I’ve seen such a great result. My acne clusters have virtually disappeared with daily use.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,"I received this product for free from bzzagent to review. I didn't expect to like this so much but it's pretty nice. It glides on the skin, super light weight and great for sensitive skin. The directions actually specify to pat the product into your skin and I was curious enough to try rubbing it in like I normally do. I prefer to pat it in with this product. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave any kind of gross feeling behind."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,This product smells like something from a spa and makes my face look really dewey when I put it on. I have dry sensitive skin and this has worked really well for me. This will definitely be a product I’ll be getting again once I finish it.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,I love this moisturizer it's so amazing! I've tried many other products and many barely worked. I could instantly feel the smoothness on my face with this one. It's completely worth the money. I used it in the morning and sometimes before bed and my face is super soft. It didn't make my hands or face sticky which is awesome. I highly recommend.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,My secret to a healthier/moisturized/youthful skin,This is my new holy grail honestly this moisturizer is amazing so light weight and hydrating this is perfect for my dry skin it also has hyaluronic acid which helps so much on my dry skin it’s nothing like a white moisturizer is more of like a water gel consistency which I find amazing Honestly I can say that this is really worth the price as you can tell him my pictures I am almost 40 years old I’m 39 years old and my skin looks plumper and better than ever with this and I’ve been using this for only 2 1/2 weeksSo I would highly recommend that you just give this a try you won’t regret it!!!
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Lightweight moisturizer,"I have dry skin, and this would maybe work better for me in the summer. It is lightweight and moisturizing, but with it being fall now, my skin needs a little more hydration. I do wish there was no fragrance in this. There is no noticeable fragrance as you are applying the product, but it is definitely in the ingredient list, which can be irritating."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,Omgg!! The Calm Water Gel Moisturizer is a absolute must have! This has to be my new fave moisturizer! It’s super lightweight and smells amazing! The tiniest bit goes a long way! It doesn’t make you oily or anything! I would recommend!
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Light cleanser!,I received this product complimentary to review or testing purposes. If you are looking for a light cleanser this cleanser is for you! I feel like it is also really good if you have sensitive skin. It leaves the skin feeling very soft and clean.
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Calm Water Gel,"First off, I would that to thank @Bzzagent for giving me the opportunity to try this out, Here is my review, I absolutely love  this so much, I have dry skin and after putting this on, it felt like my skin was so smooth and hydrated, and it doesn't irritate my skin at all, my skin loves this so much, I will totally recommend this to family and friends."
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Amazing,"This is amazing! Its very light on the skin. Which i have very sensitive skin and this helps soooo much! I have alot of dryness in my t zone and this stuff just works wonders! The scent is super nice, almost floral!"
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,Works wonders!,"This product works wonders in my morning routine. It's a light moisturizer that packs a punch with hydration. As someone who suffers from extremely dry and sensitive skin, this worked wonders. It doesn't conflict with my sunscreen - which is a frequent problem I run into when looking/using moisturizers. This is going to be my go-to morning moisturizer for a while. Thank you Bzzagent and Dermalogica!"
DERMALOGICA-Calm Water Gel,USA,I love it and i reccomended,"Well First of all I want to thank @BzzAgent for giving me the opportunity to allow me to use @Dermalogica. Well here is my review. I loved the cream too much, your face is very super soft. Weightless water gel moisturizer hydrates dry sensitive skin. I loved it too much and I think I'm going to send it to order .. Thank you very much for this great opportunity and I would love for you to always choose me that way .. I recommend the @Dermalogica cream to my 3 sisters too. my colleagues and my friends .."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Where has this been all my life?!,"My skin is the worst, plain and simple. I'm 32 with incredibly sensitive skin that breaks out with cystic pustules at the slightest hint of a comedogenic ingredient in a product. I recently started using Retina-A, which makes your skin peel terribly in effort to resurface. This moisturizer is my saving grace to combat the retinoid ""uglies"". It's pleasantly thick & creamy with an underwhelming, pleasant ""baby-powder"" type of scent. It really gets down and infuses moisture into your skin. My skin can literally be flaking off and if I apply this before bed, it's smooth and the flakes are gone by morning. I truly can't recommend it enough!"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Best moisturizer I’ve owned!,I’ve always had dry skin that drinks up my moisturizer with no results. This moisturizer is now my holy grail! My skin has stayed moisturized and supple since using this. Works great under makeup!
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Best moisturizer!,Best moisturizer I’ve owned! I’ve purchased many expensive moisturizers and none of them compare to dermalogica. It leaves my face feeling so soft.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Great for dry skin!,"Great for dry skin skin! I have used this for years. I recently started using tretinoin which makes my skin even more dry, but using this along with a Sanitas hydrating serum helps protect my skin barrier and reduce flaking."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,Canada,love,"love this, smells a bit like sunscreen but soaks into the skin nicely and lasts a while. very buildable and moisturizing. would buy again."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,Canada,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,This stuff is incredible. A little goes a long way so the price is really worth it. And my skin just loves it. It always feels so good to put on.

DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,Singapore,just another moisturiser ,"It is just another moisturiser. Has finished the tube, however it is not making any significant difference other than moisturising. At least it is not causing any breakout on my face.
"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Love it!,"This is my holy grail moisturizer. My skin is thankfully without major issues except I’m in my 40s so starting to show some lines/age (it’s ok I’ve earned it). This works really well in the winter but I use it year round cause I like it so much, just apply less in the summer."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,"Love love love this moisturizer! I have combination skin that worsens in the winter, and this balances my skin leaving it baby soft.  It also has a very light clean scent to it."

DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Best moisturizer I’ve ever used!,"I rarely leave reviews but this product & the charcoal cleanser changed my skin! I have combination skin. The hydration feels incredible and leaves my skin soft, plumper and glowing. It absorbs well, doesn’t feel like a film laying on top and although it may not immediately dry to touch it won’t make your makeup look greasy. I like to follow it up with some jojoba oil at night, especially in the winter."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,Canada,The best moisturizer I have ever used!,This moisturizer saved my skin! I have very very dry skin and this cream keeps my skin moisturized all day long (many other creams have failed to do so) a little goes a long way with this product! The scent is one of a good quality product very lightly scented. You get what you pay for. I am a student in high school with not a ton of money but splurging on this product was definitely worth it! Love love love it
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Perfect for sensitive skin,"The only moisturizer that works for my super sensitive skin. I have tried it all- creams, oils- everything. I am allergic to benz products and this truly moisturizes my skin without irritation. I don’t know what I’d do if they stopped making it."

DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Really hydrating,I have seborrheic dermatitis and have to hydrate my skin every morning and everynight. This moisturizer works wonders for my dry skin and keeps it hydrated for a long time after applying it. I like that it has no fragance and did not cause any allergic reactions to my skin. I give it 4 starts instead of 5 because it is a little pricey.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,BUY IT,"As someone with dry/dehydrated skin, I looooove this product. Wish it were cheaper but worth every penny!"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,total staple!,"This is my overall favorite moisturizer. It’s great for the days when you aren’t quite sure what to do with your face. Super gentle, non irritating, no scents, super hydrating but NOT greasy. I’ve also found that this works really well under foundation if you’re going for a dewy finish. I’ve purchased several tubes of this over the last year or so, splurge for the bigger size. It’ll last you a long time!"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,WELL WORTH THE $,"Extreme moisture that lasts all day! I have extremely dry skin and have tried numerous other products before finding this one. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has dry (sometimes combination), sensitive, and/or eczema prone skin. This product provides a penetrating layer of moisture that doesn’t just sit on the surface of your skin. A little bit goes a long way... well worth the $!"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,Canada,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,It’s worth the price moisturizing without being heavy or greasy
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,Canada,The perfect moisturizer,"I purchased this Dermalogica Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer a few weeks ago and I have been using it every single day, morning and night! I like to use this cream before I use my jade face roller to massage my face each day. This is the perfect cream for anyone who lives in a place with a generally cold and dry climate – as it is so moisturizing and immediately brings a hydrated and glowing look to your skin. As I mentioned, this cream is intensely moisturizing, but it is also super lightweight, so if you prefer a heavier cream, then perhaps a different Dermalogica cream would be better for you. I first heard about this cream from a colleague who is obsessed with all Dermalogica products, and she swears by this cream, naming it as the only cream she ever uses. This glowing review from my colleague, as well as Jade Tunchy’s (one of my favourite social media influencers) many posts about Dermalogica caused me to immediately buy the product. The minimalist and clean packaging was also a very strong selling point for me, as I am someone who likes all my skincare products to look aesthetically pleasing while sitting together on my counter. I will definitely be repurchasing when I am done with this tube!"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Great Moisture!,"This product definitely delivers moisture without being overly thick or greasy. My skin felt great and, unlike a lot of other moisturizers, not weighed down at all!"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,Canada,Use on a damp face!,"I am giving this a 4/5 because it is definitely best used on moistened skin. The package said it is intended to be used after toning when you still have a slight amount of moisture on the skin. When you do that it works as intended. So if you don’t tone, dampen your skin first. It is a very nice light moisturizer that doesn’t make you feel like you’re having to choose between fighting dryness or oily pores of your combination skin."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,This Does the Job,"I was gifted this product, so I guess I can only give 4 stars, but I'd give 5. I have somewhat dry combination skin. I used this to replace the Muji moisturising milk I was using. It felt thick at first, but during the day, my face feels soft and normal. Not dry. Not oily. Just taken care of. I don't need to reapply throughout the day. I wash my face 2x a day so I moisturise 2x a day. This product just works for me."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Didn’t work as well,"Didn’t moisturize as well as I thought. My face is dry and I need more moisture than this product provides. Definitely better to apply this product on a damp face instead of dry. I used this bottle both ways, I bought 3.4oz and almost done with it. I felt on damp face it held moisture better and when applied on dry face it felt like I needed to use more product to get same effect. Need a different moisturizer for my next purchase."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,Canada,works well for me,"This moisturizer is right for me. My skin is combination dry (more so now that it’s winter) and oily (to touch).  It applies and absorbs so beautifully on slightly damp skin.  My skin is also quite sensitive so I am hesitant to try new products, but this didn’t have any negative side effect."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Not impressed,Not moisturizing  at all. I have been using this for 2 weeks and not impressed my skin is just as dry with not change whatsoever.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Not for me,"This is a very lighweight moisturizer and I don't feel it does much for my skin. The scent is citrusy but not in a good way, it reminds me of cleaning products. I'm glad it's a small tube ..."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,TEWL Product Love,"I’m an esthetician and I needed something more for TEWL (transepidermal water loss), so I came across this product. I do like it! It definitely works best with moisture on your face - so damp still or freshly applied toner to really get this guy going. I was hoping more for a serum consistency and this is more like a moisturizer. So you can still throw moisturizer on top but I haven’t really needed to. It is a little tacky at first, but it settles well throughout the day."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,"Absolutely love this product, keeps my skin hydrated without feeling sticky, makeup glides on perfectly, very lightweight ."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Did not hydrate for me,This product did not moisturize my face as I thought it would. After putting it on my face still felt dry it also gave me a small rash on my cheek bone. It feels very dry I don’t know if the moisturizer I received is old but it didn’t feel like “intense moisture” as advertised. Will not buy again.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,perfect moisturizer,The perfect moisturizer. Not too heavy at all and pairs well with the serum of your choice. Great for daytime under makeup and moisturizing enough that after sleeping my skin still feels soft and smooth.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Apply to a moistened face!,"This product was okay at first. I felt that it made my skin feel tight and it stung a little bit, and so I was going to stop using it. I then read something that says when using products with hyaluronic acid that you should apply them to a slightly moistened face. I've started spritzing my face with water just before applying, and it's given me much better results! My skin feels moisturized! I would recommend spritzing your face with a little bit of water before applying, so that the HA doesn't draw moisture AWAY from your skin and instead brings the moisture of the water TO your skin."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Love it,I love it.... my makeup last longer with this product.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,"Love this moisturizer! Gave it 3 stars due to the price, wish it were more affordable! I do find I need to use a bit more than I was using with my Fresh beauty moisturizer.... smells great and does not break me out. Definitely recommend for dry skin!"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,I absolutely love this moisturizer. I only use about a dime size amount and I can feel it hydrating my skin for such a long time. And I have a subtle glow after every use. I just wish it was cheaper lol.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Best Moisturizer Ever,"By far the best moisturizer I have ever tried! I've even dropped some money on SKII products and so far nothing compares to this moisturizer. I love it so much because it doesn't just sit on top of the skin like most moisturizers tend to do, but somehow it seems to soak into the skin and really moisturize all the way through. I know this product is expensive but it's so amazing I will forever have this product in my cart."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,great product,By far best moisturizer I’ve tried with combo skin but parts of my face get super dry and I need a heavier coat in those areas but it’s none grease and absorbs quickly leaving your face feeling very smooth.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,worth the price!,Love this product!! My skin texture changed a lot thanks to this moisture!!! On my second tube!!! Worth the price!!!
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,"Great for my dry skin. It really helped clear up dryness and problem areas, especially in the winter. The scent and texture is great, there is nothing I dislike other than it is pretty pricey. It lasted me a long time though so I would consider repurchasing!"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Great one!,This lasted me almost 4 months. I only used it in the mornings under my makeup or sunblock and it worked great. Non greasy or tacky. It didn’t roll off my makeup either. Right amount of moisture without being to think.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,Great product! Keeps you moisturized and full of luster!
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,I received this complimentary for testing purposes. This is good stuff! My skin feels great and it’s not greasy like with a lot of moisturizers. A little goes a long way.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,A definite classic,"I was so happy to receive this as a full size sample. O have been looking for a higher quality moisturizer. I don't enjoy this scent but it isn't necessarily a bad smell. I have noticed a definite different in the moisture levels in my skin. I definitely recommend. I have very sensitive combination skin - mostly dry, sometimes oily...almost never breakout."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,I received this item complimentary through Influenster. The day after applying this to my face I broke out in a rash on my face and neck which lasted for over a week. I have not encountered anything else that has done this to me.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,This product is amazing! Leaves your skin very moisturized and soft after using it . This is the only face lotion i use on my face and neck areas for soft skin. Definitely recommend!!!
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,Product works as expected. Works well for dry skin and would recommend if it fits your price point. I received this free through influencer.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,I received this product courtesy of Influenster for testing purposes so I wanted to give it a few weeks to really see how it worked with my skin. i have combination skin with some awkward dry patches. Adding this product into my skincare routine really helped even out those areas without aggravating my t-zone. I definitely rock more makeup free days with the help of this product and couldn't recommend it more! This very awkward photo of me is without any makeup or filter besides lash extensions.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,"I received this complementary for testing and review purposes. 

I very much liked this moisturizer. It’s not too heavy but does a great job of moisturizing my dry winter skin. I would like to say that this did not wear well for me with foundation. I found that it made my face get shiny quicker and my foundation did not stick as it normally would even with a primer. So I would recommend using this at night or with no other products on top"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Great as a primer,"I received the Dermalogica Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster. I have dry/acne prone skin (sounds like an oxymoron, I know). Silicones tend to clog my pores so I usual try to avoid using facial moisturizers that have silicones in them. For this reason I used this moisturizer as a primer (primers are usual high in silicones). I’ve been using this product for about a month. I apply it after my normal daily moisturizer and before I apply my makeup for the day. The moisturizer doesn’t have much of a scent and the texture is smooth and lightweight on the skin. Dermalogica Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer as primer the works like a dream. I definitely noticed a difference in the lasting power of my makeup throughout the day after using this product. On the other hand I have very dry skin and I do not think as moisturizer this was able to give my face the moisture it really needs. For that reason and the fact this product is so expensive I would not repurchase. In my opinion this moisturizer would be best suited for people with normal to oily skin."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,"Awesome product, must try","This product is amazing! I have sensitive skin and I have actually found a product that I can actually use without breaking out! It was given to me by Influenster as a complimentary sample. 

Using this product made my face feel soft, supple, nourished and refreshed. I would use it twice a day - morning and night and it’s amazing how my skin has felt different but in a good way! The product doesn’t have a harsh smell to it and it goes on light and airy... this is my go-to one and done product!  Thanks Influenster and Demologica for teaming up and giving us this amazing sample to try!"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Not a fan of this one,"I received this complimentary from Influenster for an honest review. My combo skin tends to be more dry in the winter, and I wanted to give myself ample time using the product before deciding how my skin felt after using it. For me, it makes my skin feel oily. This may work better for someone with extreme dry skin. I will save what’s left in my tube for next winter. Maybe it will change my mind.  I didn’t see any other drastic change in my skin’s appearance after using it. It was just an okay product for me."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,I have been using this item for a month and I must say I am very impressed. It definitely has balanced out my skins moisture and did not clog my pores or left it greasy. Very light and airy feel. I received this item for free but have gave an honest review.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,This product is great! I have combination skin and it actually worked well with my skin! I got this to try complimentary through Influenster and I am so glad they sent it! I would definitely recommend
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,"My face is chronically dry and flaky, so I was so excited to try this out! 

Pros: wonderful texture. Super smooth and creamy, a little goes a long way, and it feels refreshing and not greasy at all. Absorbs quickly. 
Nice scent. I’m sensitive to smells and perfumes so I like that this hardly smells at all — only a tiny bit and it’s a nice smell. 

Cons: 
Like I said, I have very dry skin, and while this helps a lot, I do still get some flaking. I think “intensive moisture balance” isn’t quite accurate. I’m sure for most people with moderately dry skin it works like a charm, but I just occasionally add other products into my routine to keep my face all moisturized. That’s the only reason I removed a star — otherwise I don’t have any complaints. 

Note — I received this product complimentary for testing purposes."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,New staple,"Ok, I've been hunting for the perfect face moisturizer when I got to try out this guy. It is absolutely the best I have sensitive moatly dry combonation skin. I have been suffering from some allergies and severely stressed my skin was completely out of whack when I first tried it and it still worked beautifully. I love how it blends into my skin without tugging, or feeling like something just sitting on top of my skin. It has a light scent but very clean. It leaves my skin moisturized all day and night . I love not having to reapply.  This is definitely my new staple moisturizer my skin literally was dry and itchy and irritated. My skin feels so soft and started  healing up even under all this stress. I can't say enough good things about this moisturizer. Definitely worth a try!!  Highly recommend I'm so ecstatic I received this product for free or complimentary for testing purposes . Love!!!"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Decent basic moisturizer,The product consistency is nice and it’s not greasy and absorbs fast. It also did not break me out at all and sat well under my makeup. My skin did not feel dry while using it but I didn’t see any major differences in my skin after using it. I also did not care for the scent - it sort of smelled like plastic. I received this product for free for testing purposes.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,This Product is seriously the best it’s very smooth and works wonders. I’m so I love with it it also has made my skin clear up. I recommend this 5/5
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,I love this moisturizer,"I am very impressed with this product. It was thick and creamy but not oily. I would squeeze about a dime size of the moisturizer on my fingers and that would be plenty to cover my whole face and neck. It also has a nice scent, not perfumey. So happy to have received this as a free product from Influenster to test. I will be definitely be buying more and recommending it."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,"Refreshing, not oily. Would recommend this product. Wish it wasn't so expensive!"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Great deep moisturizer for all skin!,"Excellent deep moisturizer for reviving tired winter skin. I'd recommend this for skin in need to surface hydration, even very sensitive skin! I received this product for free for testing purposes."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,"This all day moisturizer keeps my skin hydrated and my face is noticeably less oily now, compared to when I used my other regular moisturizer. One downside is that my skin has broken out a little; the small acne bumps mainly arose on my forehead, jawline, and chin. Overall, I like this moisturizer as a day and night moisturizer but also wish that it were cruelty free"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Great moisturizes,"I have combination skin, I get oily in the T- zone and I am dry everywhere else. This moisturizer works really well. It moisturizes and hydrates your skin without feeling heavy and oily. It actually absorbs into the skin to hydrate and not just sit in top of the skin. When I apply this my skin feels comfortable and hydrated all day. Over all this is a great moisturizes that does exactly what it claims to do. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,"I received the product in exchange for my opinion from Influenster.  I’ve been using it for several weeks in order to get the most accurate opinion I could have for this intensive moisturizer.  It has a pleasant light scent, it’s non greasy in the slightest and immediately absorbs into my skin.  This product has made a definite difference in my skin’s appearance and fine lines.  This is a very high quality product that I recommend for anyone that is interested in anti-aging products."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,"Leaves your face moisturized without being greasy. Overall great product, only con is how little you get for the price."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,"This moisturizer is very good. It balances out your skin nicely. Not too greasy, it blends in beautifully. The only complaint that I have is the smell. I couldn't take it. Other than that, I highly recommend it! I did receive it complimentary from influenster"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Super Hydrating!,"I would highly recommend this product. I have combination skin but tend to have dry patches as well. This product was the perfect amount of hydration. It did not leave my face oily, instead it left my skin feeling silky smooth. I was skeptical about applying with a damp face but it dried quickly! There is not an overwhelming scent which is appreciated. I will definitely be adding this product to my daily routine."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Great but pricey,"Great moisturizer, not sure about the price tag though. I received this product free from influenster and was immediately excited because I’ve never been able to afford this brand before. My first impression was WOW this is amazing simply because it is much thicker than most moisturizers and doesn’t have an awful smell like most do; smells like unscented lotion. After using it for a few weeks, I still love it and have been using after my morning skin care routine before makeup and it’s amazing. My only qualm is that it’s SOOOOO expensive. $50 is a little steep in my opinion for any product much less one that is this small."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,"The name of this product really says it all, highly moisturizing without overdoing it...It balances out my dry patches and more oily patches. It's a medium consistency, so I was pleasantly surprised by how easily it absorbed into my skin. 
As there are no added fragrances, it takes on a slightly strange, but subtle smell. I favor my citrus scented products in this regard. 

I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,"This is fantastic! The texture and the way it absorbs is phenomenal. I use it the most before bed and I wake up with such a soft face. I received this complimentary, all opinions are my own! Will 
purchase this!"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,"Great product, but not for me.","The moisturizer did what it said it was supposed to. It hydrated and moisturized you face, it also helped with elasticity. I would apply 2 times a day, morning and night. It would absorb quickly which helped when applying makeup. But in my case, it created little areas where a rash appeared, especially on my cheekbones right below my eyes, on both sides. So, although I liked the product, I don't think I will continue to use. 
I received this product from #influenster complimentary for testing purposes."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Great moisturizer!,I am really pleased and surprised with how beautiful does keep my skin hydrated and what’s beautiful about it is when you apply it it doesn’t feel sticky and it get absorbed by the skin really fast leaving your skin soft and feeling great! I am glad that I have received this product complementary to review as at this price point I would have been hesitant to buying it. I would recommend this product!!
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Absorbs Well,Nice moisturizer - clean and not oily feeling - absorbs well. I do like the claim water gel better for my skin type but I still like this moisturizer.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,This is a fragrance free lightweight moisturizer. It’s the perfect moisturizer for central California. Anything thicker may have made my face oily. I’ve used this for almost three weeks now (morning and night) and I love it. I would recommend using a serum before this.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Excellent Daily Moisturizer,"I have been using this for a few weeks now and have loved it. I’ve used it in a few different ways; under CC cream, under primer and foundation, and on its own, and it’s held up in each application. It has the same balancing effect as “water/cloud creams/gels” that are very in right now, but didn’t leave the sticky film that a lot of them can leave behind. It felt like it soaked in quickly and left my skin feeling moisturized, nourished and bouncy. As mentioned before, I did use this under other products and never felt like anything I put on top of it moved around on me. I could put my CC cream on right after applying this without streaking or compromising coverage, which is a problem I run into with other moisturizers. 

This is a perfect daily moisturizer for my combo skin, I found myself reaching for it almost every day since I got it. Great for starting a weekday morning or putting on before going out on a weekend night."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Great every day moisturizer,"Great every day moisturizer. The active ingredients are skin power houses. I love the fact that it is “formulated without artificial fragrances or colors.“ I sometimes use it around my eye area even though it is not specifically for that (use caution if you do).  It absorbs quickly and is not greasy at all. Because my skin is extra dry, I put a thicker moisturizer on top of it for nighttime use. I really like the tube packaging because it makes it easily transportable.  I receive this complimentary for testing purposes."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Love it,I recieved this free from#influenster!  I have been using this daily for the last few weeks and have really enjoyed this product. I use nightly before bed and prior to putting on makeup. I love that it feels so refreshing without feeling heavy or greasy. My skin is normal to dry combination and this time of year I get really dry and patchy however since using this my makeup has a flawless look and doesnt have dry spots. My skin also doesnt seem to be as red so has provided a bit of calming and relief. I think its a good size for the price and worth the money. I will continue to purchase this.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,A Must have Moisturizing,"I am honestly surprised by this incredible product. By this time of year, my skin is so dry that I am doing a 10 step routines morning and evening to keep it moisturized. When I received Dermalogica moisture balance cream fro free to test it, I tried it alone, without any serums to understand the product more and it made me speechless. From the very beginning I felt this incredible, non greasy, lightweight structure that feels very comfortable on the skin. I tried it also under make-up and no complaints at all.It will definitely become a must have moisturizer in my skin routines. I am absolutely amazed by it, the smell is also very pleasant for me, not perfumed, like more natural and clinical. I will definitely recommend it to all my friends."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,LOVE IT!,"I actually really enjoy this product, before applying my makeup, it's not oily, just a nice sticky matte finish. I am oily on my t-zone"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Drag Must Have!,I absolutely love it I'm drag queen and after a long night of heavy makeup on stage after I cleanse my face I use some of this a my face feel absolutely smooth and moisturized I've never had that after a show
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,"I really like this product as a moisturizer. It really helped my dry spots without breaking me out or causing any sort of reaction. I really like that it’s not greasy as well and absorbs nicely! It was nice that I could use it on other parts of my body other than just the face, and it works well under my makeup. My only complaint is it does contain silicones and I personally prefer to stay away from those kinds of products. But for what it claims to do, it works really well! I received this complimentary for reviewing purposes."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Natural skin care,"I love this has some more natural ingredients to improve skin. My skin felt soft and seems to appear more even toned after a few weeks of use. I feel good about using this product. 
I received this complimentary product for sampling use thanks to Influenster in my voxbox."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Hydration in a tube,"Ok so, I received this product for free for testing purpose and was amazed. I had just returned from vacation and my face was super dry from the sun. After two days my face felt amazing. Super hydrated and not greasy which I love because I tend to be on the greasy side. I would definitely recommend. Before I run out I already have an order started."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Very underwhelmed,I tried this product for 2 weeks now and I just don’t see the value in it. I would put it on and felt no increase in moisture. Regardless of it I put it on clean skin or over other products. I’ve put it on and a few hours later noticed dry skin/slightly flaky skin. It didn’t break me out or anything. But I wouldn’t pay more than 15$ for this moisturizer. I’ve had better. Maybe if your skin is notably oily I guess it would be worth using. Idk it’s just a basic moisturizer.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,This is a must try!,I have been using this product for about a week now and I am completely satisfied with it so far. The texture is almost silky like and feels great. The directions say to use a small amount and I would agree. It glides right on my skin smoothly and ia absorbed very well. Loving this stuff and will continue to use daily. I definitely will recommend to my friends.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Great for picky girl with combo skin,"I received this for free and I’m really glad that I did. Seeing the $50 price tag I don’t know that I would have ever gone for it because I am PICKY when it comes to moisturizer but this hit all my marks. It doesn’t have that greasy feeling that lasts, it truly feels like it sinks into the skin. It doesn’t mess with my makeup application at all. It was a true savior for my winter skin. I have combo skin and get dry patches around my nose and between my brows and this helped so much. The smell is the only thing I didn’t like but it doesn’t linger."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Worth the price,"I really liked this moisture balance cream. I have always wanted to try dermologica products but was hesitant to pay the price for it. I think this product would be a great one to start with if you are interested in trying the brand for the first time as it is so easy to incorporate into your skincare routine. I have dry, red irritated skin and the really helps combat those issues when used regularly.  I will he purchasing again!"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,"Not Heavy, No Breakouts!","I received this product for free for review purposes. I also took my time with this review because skin care takes time to really see results. I’ve been using this product as directed for 3 weeks and I do really like it. I usually use the Drunk Elephant whipped moisturizer and was skeptical weather I would like this as much. 

It isn’t heavy or greasy. I didn’t notice any strong perfumes either. I wouldn’t say that I feel moisturized all day but my skin feels good, almost velvety until I get home. During my time with the product I didn’t wear any makeup to get an idea of how my skin reacts and I’m happy to say that there were no pimples or irritation for me. I don’t necessarily see a reduction in my frown/smile lines, however my pores appear minimized. 

I really like this cream and will continue using it. I think if you have oily skin this would work really well for you."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Intensive Moisture Balance,I received this moisturizer complimentary from #Influenster for testing purposes and WOW I am in love! I have tried many moisturizers in my life time and this one easily takes the top of my list! I rated 4 stars instead of five solely because of the price. It is fairly pricey however a little product does go a long way! This medical grade skin care has amazing ingredients and no artificial fragrances but naturally does have a scent. Nothing to over powering and diminishes after a short while. This product kept my skin moisturized all day and even adds a slight blurring effect to my pores. I look alive after I use this cream! It’s not thick or greasy and absorbs nicely into the skin! My favorite way to use this moisturizer is under neath my makeup! It makes my skin look FLAWLESS and I do not have flawless skin! I love this product and would highly recommend!
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Great all around moisturizer,"What a great moisturizer! I have been using this product for over 2 weeks both morning and night and my skin LOVES it. I am almost 50 and have dry skin and this has really helped my skin stay hydrated. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy at all. I have used it under makeup and it plays well with all of my primers and foundations. It is fragrance free, but does have a nice very light clean scent just from the ingredients in it. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a good moisturizer that can be used any time.

DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,LOVE this!,This is what I’ve been looking for forever! A highly moisturizing yet gentle cream that I can use everyday without leaving my skin greasy. I love this product and will be purchasing again soon!
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Top notch feels like I got it from a dermatologist,"You guys, I love this product. I feel like I’m getting a top notch product with high quality ingredients straight from a dermatologist. It has a nice light consistency and clean smell. It is hydrating without leaving your face oily. I received this product for free, for testing purposes but will definitely buy. I use in the morning and as a night cream and I can notice a big change in my skin. It’s softer and more radiant."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Wow!!,"Wow this was my first time trying one of these products in this brand. And it was amazing! I got it free to try and I can’t say how happy I am with the results. It does NOT leave an oily finish at all! It’s everything you would want it’s to be. Worth the price tag, I’ll be buying this product in the future."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Great moisturizer,This has become a great addition to my post shave routine. I put it on my face after my post shave balm. I have fairly oily skin and this doesn't make my face feel more oily like other face moisturizers. I received this free through Influenster.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Love love,"I received this item for free to review. The first evening after I use it, I could already tell a huge difference. I have incredibly dry skin and patches of flaky skin as well. The patches were almost gone by the next day. I usually have to moisturize my face 2-3 times a day to keep it from flaking. Dermalogica moisture balance is amazing! No strong smells, light, creamy and not oily! Amazing!"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,"Super moisturizing, not greasy feeling at all. Even the next day I can still feel the effect from applying the night before. Sinks into skin great. Only thing I don’t love is the smell-kind of medicinal, but doesn’t linger after application."
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Amazing Moisturizer!,"I received this product for free for reviewing purposes. I’ve tried it out for just about 2 weeks now because I wanted to make sure I was giving a completely honest review after trying the product for some time. For reference, my skin is dry and I typically have dry patches on my face that are accentuated by certain makeup products. 

I’ve been traveling for the last week and whenever I travel, I seem to have numerous issues with my skin (very dry). This has been amazing in helping keeping my skin balanced, soft and hydrated. I notice that my makeup applies so easily on top of the moisturizer - and it takes so little time to fully sink in to my skin. I’ve found that my favorite way to use this is mixing equal parts of this in with my Laura Mercier Radiance primer. I do also use a facial oil before this (this is my basic skincare routine). After the oil sets in, this moisturizer feels SO great going on over top. Amazing product!

I’m so glad that I had the opportunity to test this and will be purchasing as soon as I use up the bottle!"
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Unfortunately gave me pimples,Okay I assumed this was a facial moisturizer and used it on my face.  But the bottle does not specify facial moisturizer so maybe I messed up.  I used it once and ended up with 3 pimples the next day.  Every body reacts to every substance differently so that idk if others would have the same reaction.  But I haven't had pimples on my face for about 30 yrs so I will not put that on my face again as it was kinda a shock lol.  I probably will use it for body moisturizer. It seems normal enough of a moisturizer to me but if I experience using it on my body something fantastic or terrible I will come back and update this review.  I received the moisturizer complimentary for purposes of review by influenster.
DERMALOGICA-Intensive Moisture Balance Moisturizer,USA,Great product!!,"It definitely made my skin smooth and soft. I did wake up with a fee red spots... not sure if maybe it is from the product or just a coincidence. It smells like it has spf in it, but I couldn't find that on the package anywhere. I feel like I need to use it more before I say I'd buy it. For the price i feel it may not be the best. I've tried other products that instantly made my skin feel smoother, rather than just barely.  I did receive this product for free to test. I received this product complimentary for review purposes."
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,Canada,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,"It works well for my dehydrated, prone to redness skin. Gets absorbed into the skin fast and doesn't leave sticky feeling. For Canadian winter though I'm going to upgrade to something even more moisturizing"
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,Canada,My staple,I have tried countless moisturizers and everything leads me to a break out. My skin is so reactive.. I bought the tiny size of this and ended up going back for a big one. It gives me no problems at all. It seems to have actually helped my skin clear up and smooth out. My face looks brighter and is smooth to the touch. I’m so glad I found this one!
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,Singapore,Very Light Weight!,"My skin loves this moisturiser. Extremely light weight (gets absorbed quickly) and it works well on my oily/combi skin. Did not break me out, and it soothed my sensitive skin. A little goes a long way. Just wish it came in a bigger size! "
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,Canada,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,"i love this product i’ve been given this as a gift for my birthday and it is amazing for my skin it’s very cooling and soothing , really worth it!"
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,My esthetician recommended this product to me about a year ago and I’ve been using it ever since. I previously had dehydrated skin with some redness and she said it was due to the ingredients in a lot of moisturizers and this one is a cleaner product. My skin has done great with this moisturizer and it pairs nicely with the serums and other products I use
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,Great for sensitive skin!,"I buy this for my husband. He has extremely delicate and sensitive skin, often experiences allergic reactions, and on top of that, his skin is quite dry. This cream is a miracle-worker for him. Hydrates, soothes and protects his skin. I noticed that when he uses it regularly, his skin looks much better. I use it too sometimes but since I don't have any extreme skin concerns (I'm 27 y.o. and I have combination skin, not sensitive) it works just fine for me - nothing special. I wouldn't buy it for myself and I lean towards cheaper products like Origin, that work beautifully too."
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,Canada,not for dry skin,"Nothing wrong with it but not for dry skin, feels more watery rather than creamy."
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,Best Hydrating Moisturizer,"For someone who has oily/combo skin, this has been amazing when I’m dry! I love to use this moisturizer when it’s really cold outside, at nighttime with my retinol, or if my skin is dehydrated. If your skin feels tight and feel like product just isn’t seeping in, you’ll like this moisturizer. Very hydrating, but will say if you’re oily only use it at night or if your skin is dehydrated."
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,Perfect for the Winter,"This is truly one of the best moisturizers I have ever used. As the weather gets colder, and my skin becomes a bit drier than typical, this moisturizer walked into my life at the perfect time. This product doesn’t have any “fluff” in look or scent, but it really packs a punch where it matters: in moisture. Gifted by Dermalogica."
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,Awesome,"Such a fun product to add to my skincare routine. It definitely helps to smooth out my skin as well as hydrate and lock in moisture! This is also great for the winter and drier months. Such a great brand and product!

DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,Winter skin essential!,I received this complimentary from Dermalogica. I've loved Dermalogica products for years and the skin smoothing cream has now joined my list of loves. This cream came just in time to help me with my winter skin.

DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,I was looking forward to trying out this cream so much. I needed a new cream for my dry skin due to the change in weather. This one was pretty good. It's moisturizing enough for my dry to combo skin. Gifted by dermalogica
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,"I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica for review. I have been really enjoying this moisturizer! For starters, squeeze packaging always makes moisturizing easier and I much prefer it over using a spatula in jar packaging. The formula itself works great with the rest of my products, I don’t notice any pilling and it’s ultra moisturizing. My skin has a healthy glow without feeling heavy or greasy. I can use this both morning and night but I prefer using a little extra at night like a sleeping mask!"
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,"Dermalogica skin smoothing cream is definitely a new favorite of mine. It’s very hydrating, glides on smoothly, sinks into the skin leaving a matte finish. Its a perfect moisturizer for the winter season. It’s a light cream texture with a slight scent. Complimentary from Dermalogica."
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,Love!,"I’ve been looking for a winter skin cream and feel like I finally found it!! This product left my skin feeling so smooth and soft, without leaving any residue. Will definitely be repurchasing once I run out"
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,Dermalogica’s Skin Smoothing Cream has quickly become one of my favorite moisturizers. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated without being too heavy. The formula is actually quite lightweight for the amount of moisture it provides and I love the texture of the product! This was gifted by Dermalogica.
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,This product is perfect to use on my skin every day both morning and night. It’s not too heavy and has a lightweight gel cream that I can use along with other skin care products. I like that there’s little to no fragrance and doesn’t linger on my skin. Gifted by Dermalogica
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,"Gifted by Dermalogica, this cream has been so helpful lately. The colder months usually ends up causing me to have dry skin from face all the way to my legs. This cream has been great in soothing and moisturizing my dry skin. I also like using it on my dry hands too. Overall a good cream!"
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,"Hydrating but I prefer no scent. I do not like my face creams to have a scent, especially because it is going on my face. The size is good for the price.  Complimentary from Dermalogica, but all opinions are my own."
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,Hydrating but wasn't a fan of the scent,My skin is definitely hydrated after using it. It is a more lotion type of texture rather than a gel which I like too. The one thing I didn't like was the scent of the lotion. It's not bad where I won't use it but Demalogica has other products that smell better in my opinion. I received this product complimentary from Demalogica  for testing purposes.
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,"I don't mean to sound dramatic when I say that this saved my skin. I was going through a terrible bout of acne. Like painful, cystic acne, which I haven't struggled with in a couple of years. I wasn't sure what was triggered the breakouts (my skin was quite dry and I had been going outside in the city more often so I was exposed to more external factors than usual), so I immediately cut back on some of the products I was using and started slathering this on morning and night for over a week. Not only did this skin just do a darn good job at keeping my skin moisturized, but it worked some godly magic on my skin barrier or something because those painful breakouts were gone. Even as I was using topical treatments/pimple patches, more breakouts would pop up, but when I used this product in conjunction, my skin began to return back to normal and has remained consistenly clear since. I also love that it's a squeeze tube -- I have a tub of a thicker moisturizer that I love, but it's not always the most accessible/travel friendly product. Dermalogica strikes again!"
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,"I really enjoyed this cream. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this did not make my face red or did not cause breakouts. It’s your “working horse” cream which does its job, and I would recommend it since the tub is huge and you do not need that much to cover your face and neck. 
This product was gifted to me by Dermalogica."
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,"I’m a big fan of Dermalogica, so when they gifted me their Skin Smoothing Cream, I was so excited to try it. 

This cream is not too oily and not too creamy or heavy; it's just right. The site states that this should be hydration enough for 48 hours. For me, 48 hours is quite a stretch; I wear SPF, so I need to wash my skin nightly. For those who have dehydrated skin, it might last 48 hours. For my skin and the winter weather, I'm happy it lasts the day!"
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,"I was given this moisturizer complimentary from Dermalogica. The consistency is amazing, instantly moisturizes my skin. Easily my favorite moisturizer this winter.

DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,"Dermalogica slowly but surely is becoming one of my favorite skincare brands. This cream has a very lovely texture, it’s a very light, yet dense cream that simply melts on your skin. I can easily start applying makeup on top within 10-15 mins max. I just adore how lightweight it is, seriously! But it’s also very effective. I haven’t had any dryness sensation since I started using it. My skin feels instantly refreshed and hydrated. It both feels and looks smoother and brighter"
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,Works so far,Dermalogica gifted me the skin soothing cream in exchange for my honest opinion. Now that the weather has cooled off my skin requires so much more moisture than it does in the summer time and nothing quite does the trick. This is a rich cream that absorbs quickly into your skin and leaves your skin feeling more hydrated throughout the day. My face doesn’t look as dry the next morning either.
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,"Love the texture of this cream and that it's not too heavy or greasy. Even after hours of wear, it didn't make my combination skin too oily like other moisturizers might. It wears great under primer and foundation too.

DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,Dry skin savior!,"Gifted by Dermalogica. I’ve been going through some dry skin phase and my skin has been so dried out sometimes it can be acne prone. So I usually need a good lightweight cream that can help with that! I’ve been using this for some time now and it’s made such a huge difference on my skin! My skin is smoother, brighter, looks better in appearance and overall just feels and looks great! I would highly recommend this to all skin types esp dry skin prone skin!"
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,Great everyday moisturizer for dehydrated skin,"Complimentary from Dermalogica - As someone with acne prone but dehydrated skin, this moisturizer is perfect for me. It’s lightweight and sinks into the skin quickly but keeps my skin hydrated and comfortable throughout the day and night.

DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,"This product was gifted by Dermalogica. I have combination skin and my skin loves this. It somehow is lightweight enough, but it really hydrates my skin. There’s no greasiness and it sinks into the skin nicely. I think the name is so fitting because it has a very unique texture that somehow smooths over your skin very nicely. It truly feels like such a luxurious product. Also, I love the packaging for travel and sanitary reasons. I’m excited to continue using this product!"
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,So Creamy and Hydrating!,"This I the perfect cream for a night time routine or a daily routine for someone with dry skin.

DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,**gifted by dermalogica**This cream has been a game changer for my makeup routine. I love using this in the morning because it’s so hydrating and smoothing! It creates such a nice base for makeup or to go bare faced! The scent is barely there which is amazing. I hate an overwhelmingly perfumed moisturizer. I also love the packaging— squeezy tube is always convenient.  I would 100% purchase this.
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,"Amazing, thick moisturizer! Perf for winter!","This was gifted by Dermalogica & so far I love it!

I used this after retinol & it was the perfect choice. My skin immediately feels hydrated & restored yet again!"

This moisturizer's consistency is slightly thick, but it's not oily at all. I like using it at night because it keeps my skin hydrated til the morning. I live in a dry climate so having a moisturizer that prevents water evaporate from my skin is really essential and this moisturizer is exactly that! Another plus point is that this product is perfect when paired with exfoliating product because it's soothing on the skin."
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,10/10,I've used a few of Dermalogica products and I have to say this one did not disappoint. I was gifted by Dermalogica for this product.

This product is really rich and creamy and really helps my dried out skin in the winter. I like to switch to thicker creams in the winter time, but usually will end up really greasy/oily looking but I find that this one absorbs into the skin really well! I don’t use a lot and it just easily sinks in"
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,Good for dry skin & mature skin,"Gifted by Dermalogica. It’s a very powerful moisturizer with vitamin c, e, HA and lactic acid. It gives deep moisture and plumps the skin. It can be a bit heavy on acne-prone skin & oily skin, even combination skin. I’d recommend this moisturizer to people with dry skin and mature skin. It does make the skin super smooth and supple. Since it has many active ingredients, it is not the best for skincare beginners."
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,i love this face cream!,i love this face cream. my skin feels so hydrated when i put it on and it’s very smoothing. it wears well under makeup too! i have normal-to-dry acne-prone skin and i think this moisturizer is a great fit for me and would work well for most skin types! this is definitely becoming a staple in my skincare routine :) gifted by Dermalogica
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,Good for Winter,"I was gifted by Dermalogica. Was already a fan of Dermalogica for their pre-cleanser, so was extra excited when they introduced this cream . It makes your skin feel extra soft and hydrated which is perfect since winter is just around the corner. Highly recommend if you have dry skin."
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,Great,Such a great product! I think you get a lot for what you pay. It seems to be very high quality and I like using it daily. I would recommend it to anyone and highly suggest trying it out even if you haven’t heard of it before! I was gifted by dermalogica.
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,A GREAT Moisturizer!,"Gifted by Dermalogica: I’ve been using this moisturizer for about 2 weeks and I really love it. I have oily skin and it doesn’t leave my skin feeling extra oily or greasy, but provides nice hydration! I’m very impressed with it and I am definitely going to repurchase. Overall a great daily moisturizer!"
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,No more chicken skin!!,"I was recently gifted a tube of Skin Smoothing Cream complimentary from Dermalogica, and it has been an absolute life saver 
I have what is commonly called ""chicken skin"", a patch of small bumps all over the back of both my arms, and after only 2 days of using this product the bumps are almost entirely gone!"
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,Longtime favorite for irritated skin,"I’ve been using the Skin Smoothing Cream for years, and it has continued to be one of my favorites for many reasons. Mostly because it works wonders on damaged/irritated/sensitive skin. I like using this if I overdo it on exfoliation to help heal skin. It’s a bit pricey, but if you’re on any actives (Tret etc), this is def worth it for super hydrated skin with no irritation. Gifted by Dermalogica."
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,DERMALOGICA Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,"This product was gifted by Dermalogica. 

With the dry fall and winter months upon us, my combo dry skin definitely errs on the side of dry and flaky. The Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream purports to soothe and hydrate skin for up to 48 hours, which is quite the claim. However, I was incredibly impressed with how well this cream actually did hydrate my skin, especially the areas that I felt were tight and dry lately due to the change in the weather. This moisturizer really does seem to benefit my moisture barrier. I apply this twice a day, am and pm, and haven’t experienced any issues with this pilling under my makeup. 

I noticed some other people commenting about how this made their skin break out. I haven’t noticed any breakouts personally but I also do not have reactive skin so I can’t comment to that except to say that that wasn’t my experience. If you have oily skin, I might choose a different product to be on the safe side."
DERMALOGICA-Skin Smoothing Moisturizer Cream,USA,Beautiful Every Day Moisturizer!,"Dermalogica gifted me their Skin Smoothing Cream, and I've really been enjoying this product lately! It leaves the skin feeling so hydrated & nourished, and remains that way throughout the day. The texture is silky smooth which I love, and it has a light, fresh scent that isn't at all bothersome or overpowering.

DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,great product,Great oil free moisturizer. Absorbs fast and does not leave a greasy feel.
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,"Great ingredients, not-so-great formulation...","I was drawn to 'Active Moist' due to its many fantastic plant-derived ingredients. My first attempt at applying it was on a morning. Bad idea! I found it did not sink into my skin at all and just sat there, making any sunblock applied over it an impossible task, let alone makeup. I found this unusual as the product is supposed to be oil-free. Thinking I had perhaps applied too much product, I removed it with a makeup wipe and applied even less this time around, but the effect was the same, albeit less pronounced. The next time I applied it was on an evening, at the end of my cleansing routine. This for me was more ideal as I had no other products to apply over this and could let it sink in (or so I thought) overnight. Unfortunately it didn't really sink in. What I liked about Active Moist the most, apart from ingredients, was the fact that it did not cause any adverse reactions - breakout, itchiness etc. It hydrated fairly well too, but I feel a lot more could be done to improve the formulation so that it doesn't sit on the skin and absorbs more easily.

DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Smells like mildew,"Smells a little like lavender, but also like mildew. I don't find it to be very moisturizing, but it absorbs rather well. I usually stay away from heavily scented moisturizers anyway."
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,"I love dermalogica products, and maybe this moisturizer has benefits to your skin but unfortunately I would never know because I can’t stand the smell! I don’t know why everyone is ok with the smell but it’s terrible!! It’s like I put peat on my face or something. So I’d rather stay with my favorite dermalogica calming moisturizer, which doesn’t have any smell at all and I believe it should be like that."
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,amazing & lightweight,"I love this moisturizer. It’s very lightweight & gentle. I use my heavier creams at night, & this in the morning, so my face doesn’t feel greasy throughout the day. Absorbs SUPER fast tho, I usually have to put on 2 layers to feel 100% moisturized."
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,Not really doing it for my skin. The moisturizer gets absorbed so quickly and my skin still feels dry afterward. I also find the smell off-putting.
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,For The Oily Peeps!,I’ve been using this moisturizer for about a month and half now and I love it! I’m a really oily person so this is perfect for my skin. It doesn’t feel heavy and it actually penetrates the skin while not leaving a shiny film afterwards. Definitely buying again!
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,"This moisturizer is lightweight yet hydrating. Great for people with oily to combination skin.  The scent is however weird. Another con is that it is pricey for a moisturizer.

*gifted by dermatologic but opinions are my own"
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Absorbs well and no greasy feeling,I received this moisturizer complimentary from Dermalogica to try and review. I am on my second tube of this Dermalogica Active Moist oil free moisturizer and I really like it a lot.  I have oily skin and frequently have issues getting moisturizers to absorb into my skin. Many just sit on the surface and don’t actually penetrate and sink in to actually do what they need to do.  Active Moist absorbs into my skin so well and doesn’t leave a greasy feeling behind.  Dermalogica gets bonus points for being cruelty free and made in the USA!
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,great for combination skin,"The  Active Moist cream was gifted by Dermalogica for reviewing purposes, and it did not disappoint. I love how fast the lotion absorbs. It leaves it soft and hydrated. 
I also enjoy that it doesn't have a strong scent.  It is on the lighter side, so perfect for my combination skin. But drier skin types might need something a little more substantial."
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,"Dermalogica active moist is hydrating, nourishing, glides on smoothly, but leavings a slight tackiness on my skin. Its a nice moisturizer for the autumn season, a little bit goes a long way. It’s a gel cream texture with a slight scent. Thought it’s a gel cream texture it had a good enough hydration for autumn season. For the winter months, may need to layer for a bit more hydration. Complimentary from Dermalogica."
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Great moisturizer for winter,"This is an oil free moisturizer that provides an extra boost of hydration. It is loaded with so many skin boosting ingredients to moisturize and retain moisture in the skin - Butylene Glycol and hydrolyzed jojoba esters. The moisturizer is a white color with a creamy texture. This does leave a slight tackiness, but it will absorb right into the skin after 30-60 seconds so I prefer to apply this to damp skin before applying my serum – cleanse, tone, serum, tone, moisturizer. This way it better helps the skin absorb the product. If you want it to absorb even better sometimes, I apply toner or mist afterwards. After using the moisturizer my skin does feel more hydrated, making this a good moisturizer for the colder months. The cream has a light fresh scent which is quite refreshing.  Gifted by Dermalogica in exchange for my honest opinion."
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Fantastic,This was received complimentary from Dermalogica.  This is another HIT from Dermalogica!

DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,"Dermalogica is a big part of my skincare routine  and I was very excited when they gifted me t the Active Moist moisturizer for my honest opinion. The packaging as usual is very presentable and the product comes in a box.  You get a huge amount of product 100ml when most face creams and serums are only 30-50 ml .
The cream it self is very light and immediately leaves my skin very  soft and smooth. Little bit goes a long way. I love the combination of nature and science- the formula has probiotic complex and mix of botanical extracts. 
It absorbs very quickly without any residue and I can use it under makeup as well without any cakiness on the skin.  The smell is OK, very light citrusy scent  and is the only thing I would change to make perfect.  Overall excellent product and other big hit from Dermalogica family."
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,"Dermalogica active moist has a gel to cream kind of texture. It gives you the extra hydration that you need during winter without feeling oily.

DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Love this stuff!,I really love this moisturizer. It feels really amazing and the scent is sooooooo soooo good!!

DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,"This is a moisturizer I think best suited for normal, combination and oily skin types. I expected it to be heavier than it is and perhaps a great heavy winter cream for my combo oily skin but rather it’s more like a lightweight cream gel. It’s not a bad thing it’s just not what I was expecting. It’s nicely moisturizing for the warmer months but will require me some layering with other products in the winter. The size is generous for the price. I do recommend. I received this product completely from Dermalogica."
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,"Amazing for all skin types! My skin feels instantly hydrated right after application. The cream has a very light fast absorbing texture, it’s like a very light cream, not gel-like at all. It doesn’t have any smell, which is a huge benefit for me. I noticed it does a good job calling the sound down after sun exposure or very aggressive masks. Any redness goes away within 15 mins. The cream doesn’t cause any irritation, and doesn’t clog pores. I feel like it’ll be a great addition to anyone’s skin care regime.I received it complimentary from Dermalogica."
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Great lightweight moisturizer option!!,"I really enjoyed this light weight moisturizer. It’s a perfect day cream for me and my oily skin when I can’t have anything heavy under my makeup.  This cream is almost gel/water based feeling as you apply it, SUPER thin consistency and absorbs quickly and completely into the skin, leaves no residue and is perfect prep for using under makeup. I definitely agree it provides a good hydration for smooth skin for foundation application. It’s a really good moisturizer for your light weight category! No issue with adverse effects or sensitivity after using it either."

It isn’t heavily scented like some of their other products I have tried & is thick enough that it can be used day or night. My skin immediately felt hydrated & the cream sinks into the skin very nicely. I was able to apply a thick layer of it & it definitely was absorbed & didn’t just sit on top like some other moisturizers I’ve tried.

DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Smells AWFUL,"I was excited to try this, as moisturizers are always something I feel like I can’t have too much of. I was sorely disappointed because I will never be using it again. The smell is so u pleasant that it overshadows any other aspects of the product that could have been good.

DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Amazing for combination skin,*Gifted by Dermalogica*I was pleasantly surprised by how well this moisturizer works for skin. I have sensitive combination skin so moisturizers can be very hit or miss for me but this one strikes the perfect balance between providing enough moisture while also not feeling oily or heavy. It feels like it’s actually being absorbed instead of sitting on top of my skin.
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,SO HYDRATING AND LIGHTWEIGHT,"I have really been enjoying this moisturizer for daily use. I have combination skin that tends to get oily in my t-zone through out the day. This cream is extremely light weight. It come out of the tube looking thick, but as soon it touches your skin, it melts and turns almost into a watery texture. It absorbs really fast and leaves my skin extremely soft all day. I highly recommend this for those with oily skin, it’s truly my new go-to.

DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Love the texture and feel,"It was my first time trying out the Dermalogica, they gifted me their Active Moist moisturizer and I was super intrigued. 

The scent is not my favorite, I feel like it kind of smells as it is expired but I knew it wasn’t. After looking further on it I noticed the smell is normal but that’s the one thing I’d change about the product.

Texture and feel are amazing I love applying it it feels like a very luxurious coat of cream. It makes my skin super soft and smooth and it’s amazing to the touch. My skin felt hydrated and gloomy. I can’t wait to try more dermalogica products in the future."
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Great for oily skin,"I have oily skin and its hard to find a good moisturizer. I was gifted by Dermalogica their active moist and I really liked how well it absorbs, how it feels and hidrates my skin, and how social responsable the brand is. Im just not a big fan of the smell."
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Not for me,"Dermalogica gifted me the active moist oil free moisturizer and exchange for my honest opinion. Dermalogica products tend to be a hit for me because they always create the products with the consumer in mind and have ingredients that truly work on your skin. 

The moisturizer comes in a squeeze bottle with a spout at the end making it easy for all the product to be used up. The moisturizer has a light weight consistency and absorbs into your skin quickly. 

As much as I wanted to like this moisturizer it just wasn’t for me. My skin tends to be very dry during the winter time and it requires a lot more moisture than what this moisturizer has been able to provide for me. I think this might work really well for someone with a more oily complexion but it’s a pass for me."
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,"I love this cream because it is gel, and it is very good for me since I have combination skin, its texture is very light, and I feel that it gives me hydration and firmness to the skin. Gifted by Dermalogica!!"

DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Not For Me,I was so excited to try dermalogica however this was a huge pass for me :( I didn’t read the ingredient list and found this to be overbearing. I don’t mind fragrance in products but too much causes my skin to flush and itch. I guess it’s my fault for not taking a closer look. I do enjoy the consistency and think a fragrance free version would be incredible! This product was gifted by Dermalogica for review purposes.

Gifted by Dermalogica
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,For reference I have combination skin with a very oily T zone. I usually aim for lighter moisturizers as they tend to keep the forehead shine at bay but they tend to not be enough for the winter. This moisturizer does a good job of keeping my drier cheeks happy without making my t zone too oily. Would recommend to try! Gifted by Dermalogica.
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Great,"This was gifted by Dermalogica. Great light moisturizer!

Overall, there are other gel moisturizers I enjoy more at a more accessible price point."
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Lightweight and hydrating,"It is lightweight which I love, I usually don't like heavy mosturizers, the best thing is that it does it job well, my skin feels hydrated and nourished, something that I really appreciate it is not having added fragance which is great because I feel is better for my skin.

DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Amazing feel!,I have been really enjoying this moisturizer. It is light and spreads really easily onto the skin. BUT it really keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day. I like that it doesn’t sting my skin and I am not quite sure about the prebiotics but my skin didn’t break out or feel any more or less textured. It is more like a basic moisturizer that feels incredibly lightweight but still moisturizes for a long period of time.
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,DERMALOGICA Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,"Dermalogica products work so great for me and this is no exception! Love the lightweight feel and texture, feels refreshing and hydrating. My skin is oily and this doesn’t make me extra oily or leave any residue behind. Great for morning and night.
Gifted by Dermalogica for review."
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Happy Skin!,"(Gifted by Dermalogica) I personally didn't notice any scent to this moisturizer, which I have no problem with either way because my skin isn't sensitive to it. I have dry/combo skin so I was a little unsure of how this would go. BUT thankfully while it is lightweight, it also didn't feel runny or disappear. Sinks in nicely & no greasy or sticky feeling after. My skin feels soft & hydrated. I like to top it with rosehip oil (my pm routine secret) & it has never pilled or caused an issue. This one is a winner for me."
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Works Great,This is an amazinggggg moisturizer. It is odorless and super light on my skin. I use it every morning as part of my skincare routine. A little product goes a long way. This product was gifted by Dermalogica.
DERMALOGICA-Active Moist 2.0 Moisturizer,USA,Love this!,"This moisturizer is so good! As the weather cools down, a good effective moisturizer is a necessity and this one checks all the boxes. It sinks in and doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky, but super hydrated! I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica."
EVE LOM-Moisture Cream,USA,Perfect for Winter,"I love how thick this moisturizer is! it's perfect during cold weather as it will really hydrate and moisturize your skin. I have oily - combination skin and I don't have a problem using this one at all. It has a mild scent which is good but I am kind of staying away from scented products due to health issues. But overall I think this is an amazing moisturizer. Super reliable, though the price could be a little too expensive."
EVE LOM-Moisture Cream,USA,Not for dry skin,I have dry skin and this product breaks me out. It’s really thick so it feels like it clogs my pores.
EVE LOM-Moisture Cream,Canada,Buy it at TJ Maxx,"I bought this for $24.99 on clearance at TJ Maxx and it's superb. 

It's a good Winter moisturizer for my oily combo skin. Super hydrating, doesn't make me break out, has a slight essential oil scent (which is nice). It's got nice, sturdy packaging that unfortunately is easily covered with fingerprints. It is a good product, like all Eve Lom products. I recommend it if you find it on clearance."
EVE LOM-Moisture Cream,USA,Eve Lom Moisture Cream - 50ml,"The price on this is absolutely ridiculous which is why I took a star off. This is a good moisturizer though. It is beautifully thick in the jar but when you scoop it out and rub it on the skin it melts in just beautifully. I am almost 39 years old with normal skin that is extremely acne prone. This has not broken me out or clogged my pores. It’s moisturizing yet light enough that I’m able to wear it under my sunblock and not have any kind of oily or greasy breakthrough. It dries to a hydrated yet velvety finish on the skin that is truly beautiful. I do not I have sensitive skin so the essential oils in this are not an issue. In fact my skin loves essential oils. Would I pay full price for this? Absolutely not. Would I pick this up if I saw it at TJ Maxx (which it has been recently on clearance for $20)? Absolutely. I would recommend this for normal skin, this would be good for any age group in my opinion."
EVE LOM-Moisture Cream,USA,Eve Lom Moisture Cream - 50ml,"I'm objectively giving this 4 stars due to the price and a few minor issues listed below. I do really like the cream however, and will likely continue using it since I personally enjoy the aesthetics (feel/scent/ease of use) and the effects are solid.

Pros:
-Smooth application and a little goes a long way.
-Nice, but not overpowering, scent.
-Richly moisturizing cream that establishes an occlusive barrier without feeling overly heavy (it feels like you get protection comparable to a rich heavy cream, but the texture and feel of one that is medium weight). 
-Keeps skin from losing much hydration.

Cons (Mostly nitpicks)
- Price. If its not in your budget I wouldn't consider it a must buy (more of a nice to have).
- Essential Oils. While this does not bother my skin, there are several essential oils that some people may find sensitizing.
- While there are skin plumping ""hydration"" effects, I feel it is a better moisturizer than a hydrator. Used with a toner/essence it will do a lot to lock in the hydration, but a water cream may feel more hydrating on the skin.

Final Thoughts: I'm someone who typically likes lighter creams than what I should probably be using. I often opting for a water cream (such as Tatcha's) while supplementing that with a bit of light facial oil to obtain an occlusive effect since richer creams bother me. This is one of the only moisturizers I enjoy wearing in cold weather that gives me both a protection and feel I like. While there is nothing making this a ""must have"" at this price, and I could see the formulation resulting in irritation for sensitive skin, I would still recommend it."
EVE LOM-Moisture Cream,USA,Not that hydrating,"I wanted to love this. The consistency feels thick and luxurious - exactly what I want in the winter. I have dry and sometimes sensitive skin. The cream is not very hydrating and something in it is sensitizing my skin, so it feels more tight after drying on application."
EVE LOM-Moisture Cream,USA,Nice lightweight cream for night,"This product is very lovely. It’s not a heavy cream, previously I had been using Dior Capture Totale universal cream. This cream is lighter than that one for sure. This has a beautiful herbal like scent and melts really quickly. I have normal to dry skin and this is nice and hydrating although I’m not sure if it will be enough in my severely cold winters I have where I live.  I like the little applicator that it comes with to scoop the product but I wish it was smaller so it could fit in the lid. I am satisfied with this cream and it should last me a while. No adverse reactions to it. Skin looks nice and plump. I have little to no wrinkles but I am actively using nicer products to prevent them."
EVE LOM-Moisture Cream,USA,Eve Lom Moisture Cream - 50ml,I tried this in Sephora retail store and it is really good. So me and my friend bought 2 of them during the 20% off period.
JACK BLACK-Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream,USA,Alcohol in the ingredient!,"I had high hopes for this product as the reviews seemed pretty good and the ingredients seemed pretty good. I have very dry and sensitive skin so I was looking for something hydrating without fragrance and alcohol. Upon trying the product, it felt a bit thick to spread out at first, then it was fine. But I felt like my face wasn't as hydrated as it should be, even a bit dried? I checked the packaging again, and I see alcohol as an ingredient!! I don't know why Sephora's ingredient list (as well as the official website's) is not the same as the packaging! Either way, it is not for me.

T-Butyl and Alcohol are the two ingredients not listed on the websites."
JACK BLACK-Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream,USA,very calming,bought it for by boyfriend that had alot of irritation issues with his skin and it helped tremendously now he uses it day and night!
JACK BLACK-Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream,USA,Redness Relief,"My skin is prone to redness and it tends to get worse during the summer. Within the past two years I've grown to really trust this brand, so when I found this product under a ""skin redness"" search I decided to give it a chance. Such a relief I found this product, literally. Every skin type is different, but hopefully the two photos I've attached will help you decide if this product is worth a try. It's a pricey product, but well worth it. I apply a thick layer over the redness and let it air dry for about ten minutes then massage it onto my skin. So far I've only used this product as needed as it provides tons of hydration and it makes my skin look oiler than what it is already."
JACK BLACK-Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream,USA,Oh mannnn,I don’t write reviews and this is a guys skin care line!!! That being said this is a holy grail cream for my face. My face has been a wreck since right now during the lockdown I can’t tan. I tried and ordered a few different skin creams from Sephora and nothing beats this. It calmed down my redness and my dryness. Made my skin texture so much better. Just buy it you won’t regret it.
JACK BLACK-Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream,USA,JACK BLACK Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream,I bought this for my husband at Christmas and he loves it. Just bought him more during the spring sale. He's a tough one to impress but he said it's made his skin feel smoother without irritating it. He uses it day and night.
JACK BLACK-Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream,USA,"Really great for calming, but not super hydrating","My skin isn't always super sensitive, so I don't have to usually rely on products especially for calming the skin. I use glycolic acid on my face daily and sometimes lactic acid, and I never really have a problem, but I got a sample of Sunday Riley's Good Genes and after one use my face was SO dry and irritated and was peeling EVERYWHERE. It hurt when I was putting even the most gentle products on it, so I tried this. Because my skin was in absolute chaos, it did sting a little when I first put it on, but stopped after a few seconds and every time I've used it since it hasn't stung at all. I feel like it does do a good job of calming the skin down and I enjoy using it. My skin is always super dry, though, so if you also need a lot of hydration, I'd suggest also using a hydrating serum or saving this for when your skin is having a freak out moment. However, it is a really nice and light daily moisturizer for times when your skin isn't as dry."
JACK BLACK-Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream,USA,JACK BLACK Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream,Bought it for my boyfriend. He loves all jack black products. High quality and perfect scent for men.
JACK BLACK-Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream,USA,this stuff is magic,"I never used to moisturize because I didn’t think i needed it, but then I started to notice the start of fine lines on my forehead and between my eyebrows. I tried all the expensive Sunday Riley and PTR stuff and never noticed a real difference. This cream is amazing! I like how thick and substantial it feels, but it only takes like a dime size amount to easily spread all over my face and neck. I can actually SEE AND FEEL a difference in the texture of my skin: less dry skin on top, firmer skin, less fine lines even on my neck. I use it at night, sometimes in combo with the JB pro glycolic pads, and I wake up with skin that doesn’t even need makeup! Forget all those pricey brands with ingredients that do nothing. This is only one step and makes a huge difference!"
JACK BLACK-Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream,USA,"So far, so good.","I tried using the DR. JART  Cicapair moisturizer but wasn't seeing results after two tubes and the price point wasn't worth it. I've always struggled with uneven skin tone and not much has made a big difference over the years.

I've had this about a week and it has made a tiny difference in overall facial redness. It has slightly reduced redness on a sensitive, red spot on my cheek. It has made the biggest difference on my decollete area, which got a bad sunburn in my early 20's and has been red and easily irritated since.. and breaks out so easily. This calms the redness there for sure.. no miracles, but noticeably improved tone. No irritation or breakout issues anywhere for me using this.

I've come to realize my skin has been changing now that I'm in my 30's and I need a heavier moisturizer for winter than in the past. I think this is sufficient, but on my dryer days, will require a second application around nose/mouth where I get the worst. It is a little shiny, but I think this is the 'dewy' look I hear so much about but never experience for myself.. it's not thick or heavy and once I wait (about 10-15 mins) or apply makeup (less than 10 min after application), I've not noticed any issues with shine. 

I'm really happy with the way my complexion has been looking since I've been using it, which.. I don't know if I've ever said? When I'm applying my makeup in the morning, I've found myself just staring, impressed, at my skin tone. I've struggled with cystic acne, redness, sensitivity, oil, etc for ages and I think this is one of the best products I've ever used.. and at such a great value. Super impressed."
JACK BLACK-Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream,USA,My husband LOVES it!,"I bought it as a little random present for my husband that he would stop using my face cream when I am not around.. LOL!
He absolutely loves it and stays it keeps him hydrated all day long."
JACK BLACK-Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream,USA,so calming.,very underrated product. this cream is loaded with high quality ingredients to sooth and heal the skin. worked great for me. no fragrance whatsoever. love it.
JACK BLACK-Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream,USA,A Pleasant Surprise,"I was looking for a more affordable alternative to Dr Jarts tiger Balm Cream and I think this may be it. Although it is not as hydrating and does not soothe my redness quite as much, it still works wonders and is possibly a better weight of moisturizer for summer. Didn't make me break out, and is still very soothing for my dry, ultra sensitive and redness prone, skin. The packaging is also much better (longer lasting, non-breakable) than Dr Jart's, and the product lasts longer (I got about 4-5 months out of one bottle)."
JACK BLACK-Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream,USA,feels wonderful on the skin!!!!,Is very calming and nice. The ingredients are very gentle and useful. I cut it with oil as well otherwise it could probably run out fast.
JACK BLACK-Dry Erase Ultra-Calming Face Cream,USA,So far so good,I just started using this as my night moisturizer and so far I like it. It definitely has a shiny feel and look to it so I wouldn't recommend it for daytime unless you have super dry skin. But I struggle with breakouts and this product does not cause me to break out more.
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,Canada,OVER PRICED NO GOOD,Over priced cr*p. Doesn’t even moisturize good. Skin feels dry still. I need to stop buying stuff off here. These reviews sucker you in. So disappointed in the product and brand.
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,I always seem to come back to this moisturizer because it really is so good! I know it's a men's line but I've been using it for years. The ingredients are amazing and it moisturizes while keeping oil at bay. I love the pump and it really lasts a long time.
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,Canada,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,"I’m a guy with generally oily skin, but get dry spots in the winter (Alberta). This moisturizer is great for me. It’s hydrating, but doesn’t add shine or make my face more oily."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,Canada,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,"I ordered this with my package, but it didn't get sent. Alittle bummed as it was for my bf. I read the reviews..  hopefully I can get it the next time again if I order it."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,Canada,"I know this is a ""Mens"" moisturizer but...",(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Better than any other oil controlling moisturizer I have ever tried! Wish I tried this before I bought the tatcha water cream. Face is instantly matte and when paired with my etude house surprise suncreen my oily face stays matte ALL DAY even though I usually get oily just a couple hours later. Got about 3 uses in the sample and will purchase as soon as I finish my tatcha.
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,Canada,good moisturizer,Bought it for my boyfriend and it seems it does the job. It’s not shiny which he seems to appreciate but I feel like the scent could be better.
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Really good moisturizer,When I started using this moisturizer it was the beginning of summer and I thought it was a little heavy but I got used to it. I've now moved a couple of hours from my hometown and into a city and I now find that I might need a little heavier moisturizer than this one. I think this moisturizer works best in the fall/winter season. I don't think this moisturizer went the extra mile and did incredible things to my skin but it's a good one if you need to hydrate your skin. It goes on the skin easily and absorbs really nicely after a few minutes. Will be buying this again.
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,It’s not hydrating enough and my face turns super red after applying it
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,Canada,Favourite Moisturizer!,"I have the world's most sensitive skin (I don't have bad acne by any means but I have to be very careful of what I put on my face) and this moisturizer is my favourite! It's light-weight, absorbs quickly, and doesn't cause breakouts but controls oil SO well!"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,Canada,Simple and does the job,Bought this for my boyfriend and he likes it. Lightweight but moisturizing enough for him.
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,"An absolute staple in our house for both myself and my husband for the past two years. Gentle on sensitive, acne-prone skin. In the winter I do need to use an additional weekly hydrating mask as this is on the lighter side, but overall this is my daily go-to moisturizer."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,Canada,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,"No irritation or break outs with this moisturizer for my husband. He's a no fuss kind of guy and doesn't liking anything heavy or sticky. No issues with this. He's got acne prone, prone to redness kind of skin. Onto his second bottle."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,RETINOL'S BEST FRIEND,"WOW! Oily skin, acne prone friends, the hunt is over!!! I cannot say enough about this moisturizer, I will never buy another kind again. This is IT! After a week of using, I can see a visible difference in my skin texture and overall skin brightness. The niacinamide works SO well with retinols/retinoids, you will see such a difference in your skin immediately! I definitely recommend mixing in an oil for winter time if you need a little extra oomph because it really is designed for those who are oily."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,Canada,Love it,"I love this product for humid summer weather. It glides on the skin and does not break me out. It is not super moisturizing, but I really enjoy it and it sits well under other skin care and makeup."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Favourite Moisturizer!,"After trying this in a sample size, its the only moisturizer I use! Ive repurchased it a good three times since trying it and plan to keep doing so. Works great, leaves my skin feeling wonderful. I have sensitive skin so I'm always nervous with a new prodict but by far the best I've had!"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,Great for sensitive skin
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Love Love Love,I received a sample of this and just love it.  I used this under my foundation with no problem.
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,"Absolutely LOVE this moisturizer. Feels light on my combination, sensitive/acne-prone skin. I've been using it for around a year now and am a loyal fan."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Amazing!,This is a great moisturizer!! It's easily to apply and keeps my face feeling moisturized for a long time. I originally got the sample but had to order the full size once it was finished!
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,HOLY GRAIL!,"got this as a sample and after finishing decided to buy the full version. I have a super oily t-zone and struggle to find products to help my makeup from dissolving during the day from the oil, and this does the job. I'm so happy with the results I've seen over the past week of using. will never use a different face cream again! 
I did have some break outs over the first few days of my skin adjusting to the new product."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,oil free but smells and feels like face oil,"Absorbs quickly, great winter moisturizer, but it is too heavy for use in summer. The smell is just awful."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,I don't care if it's men's face lotion!!,"I bought this because I wanted something light on the skin and something that did not have an overwhelming scent.  I have sensitive skin and am prone to scent induced headaches.  I love this face lotion and AP does my son!! A little goes a long way and it feels really nice on the skin,  not oily or heavy."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Absolute fav.,"Love it !!! Noticed huge improvement on my acne. Lasted about 6 months for me,  little goes a long way. Definitely recommend."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Works for Dry skin too!,"I’m in my mid 20s, Combination- Dry to Very Dry skin with some texture and some large pores/ sebaceous filaments. Generally, I reach for heavier or richer creams for my face. It tends to feel tight and dry, and will then begin to over produce oil. And although this doesn’t provide the oil I need, it’s one of the only moisturizers to make my face feel fresh and hydrated. It cooly soothes it and I normally won’t feel the need to add another moisturizer over it. I also really love this formula for under makeup. It doesn’t pill, it doesn’t interact with the makeup negatively, it isn’t shiny, and it gives a smooth base. I’m almost on my third bottle."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,"Not just for men! Light moisturizer, absorbs well","I got this as a free sample from Sephora, maybe a free birthday gift, not sure. I used every last bit of it. As in, cut the dang sample container open and scraped the lotion out of it so I wouldn't waste the tiniest minuscule amount that was left. I've already ordered the full size and hope it arrives soon. First of all, I had no idea it was a men's product until after I started searching other Jack Black products. This particular moisturizer has a light clean scent, so that threw me off but hey it works for me so I'm still a fan. Second I am in love with this product!!! It's light, it absorbs immediately, it's very refreshing, sort of cools my skin. I can put this on and then apply makeup right after. My skin is typically oily but if i don't put some kind of moisturizer pre-makeup, my makeup looks scaly even if i use a primer. Also i have super sensitive skin, everything makes me break out and lots of creams burn or affect me but this one doesn't at all. I wouldn't say it prevents acne or stops my skin from being oily but it doesn't add to whats already going on with my skin if that makes sense!"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,Nice basic moisturizer with some added boosters like niacinamide.  I received this as  a sample and am considering repurchasing.  I did not find it enough i  the winter though; more suited for less dey months.
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,"It is great for use as a daily moisturizer, but I would recommend a more intense moisturizer for problem spots. This is a very light formula which is good for people not looking for a heavy feeling after. The oil-free aspect was also very important for my skin."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Great for acne prone skin,I love this moisturizer so much! I got a sample of it about a year ago and had to buy the actual product because it works so well. I use it under my foundation and it's the best moisturizer I've used so far. I also have acne prone skin and it seems to calm down any spots or redness that I have.
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Does the job,"I got this for my husband who has sensitive skin and does not really like to apply any type of products in general. And if his face gets extremely dry he would unwillingly apply a tiny bit of my products, so I did my research and after reading countless reviews, I decided to just get this for him, along with the face wash. He had break-outs or was not a fan of the Clinique for Men, or the Lab Series, so this really was my final hope. And I'm so relieved that I did. It's fuss-free, it does it's job. His feedback is that ""it does enough to get the job done."" He still doesn't apply too much but that's just personal preference, but his skin is a lot smoother and he doesn't break-out while using this and has gotten into the rythm of using it daily, and that's all we could both really ask for."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,This is my all-time favorite facial moisturizer. My face gets extremely oily and certain oil-free products are hard to find for me so this is a necessity! It also lasts surprisingly long!! At this point I'm waiting for it to run out so I can open a fresh bottle!
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,great moisturizer for oily skin!,Works wonderfully under make up. I use it in the mourning because it’s not the heaviest moisturizer which makes it perfect for during the day.
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,super!,"I got a free sample of this moisturizer in my bday bag from Sephora and totally fell in love. I had combination skin and I feel like moisturizers + suncreens just make my skin so oily towards the end of the day and I can't do without them. This moisturizer was the perfect fit for me, it keeps my skin nice and smooth and although I can see my T zone a bit shiny in the afternoon it is not as bad as when I use a non oil-free."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,best moisturizer,"Even though this is marketed towards men, I use it and I will never go back. After just one use, I can see the difference. After a few days of use, my skin is less blotchy, more even toned, and smooth."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,I got this as a birthday gift and I love it!!! I have combination skin and it makes my skin feel hydrated and doesn’t make my skin oily! Would 100 percent recommend
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,"Very nice daily oil-free moisturizer.  Keeps skin nice an matte and isn't too thick.  May not be moisturizing enough for when skin is really dry but good for daily moisture.  Just wish it was a less expensive, I mean, it's just moisturizer."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Im in Love,this is now my go to Moisturizer i have very fuzzy skin that will just break out if it doesn't like a product but this is just a dream to use
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Great,"I bought this for my fiancé to use every other day. His skin a little dry, but otherwise normal. He uses it and likes it very much. Seems to help keep face clear and moisturized well. We'll be ordering it again."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Doesn’t Leave Film,"My boyfriends favorite! He says it is the only moisturizer he’s tried that doesn’t leave a film on his face, and sinks right in. He also loves that it is in a pump! Will repurchase over and over again!"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Not for regular makeup wearers,"I tried a sample and loved it initially because it *felt* nice... Bought it, used for a few weeks....threw it away in the end after two weeks of use.

I realized the smooth feeling you get from this is from the silicone ingredients. There are mostly only very basic ingredients in this. Oil free can be good, but sometimes even acne prone skin can handle oil, and can even benefit from certain oils. I am combo...mildly oily and normal in different areas of my face. In the end, this looked horrible under my makeup... meaning it made it look as if my skin was flaking off with the makeup. Like I had dry, scaly skin. But it was this balling/flaking. This effect was the worst around my eye area, where I need the most moisture.

I would avoid this if you are trying to avoid many products with dimethicone. This contains ""smoothing"" ingredients and thickeners, but there isn't anything about this that sets it apart from all of the various moisturizers for oiler/combo skin - and there isn't enough moisture. I will give it points for the inclusion of antioxidants, but the presence of silicone bumps my praise down. 

This *is* marketed as a men's product - and it is *assumed* by most marketing teams that the average man does not wear makeup, so they do not bother formulating a product such as this one for use under cosmetics."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Made me even oilier,"Unfortunately this made me even oilier throughout the day. I had to blot almost hourly. It had such good reviews and I was hoping my quest for the right moisturizer was finally over... but it didn’t do anything for oil control but made it worse. If you’re are truly oily like me, then this might not work for you. If you’re combination or occasionally oily, then this might do."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,"Does what it says, need a hair more moisture","It feels super great on the skin, light and refreshing especially for us oily-combo folks. After using it for several weeks in the winter, though, I notice it doesn't deliver quite enough moisture to my dry, acne-prone patches. This is okay for me because I have some FAB Ultra-Repair Moisturizer for those patches, but I'd suggest looking for something a little more hydrating if you tend to have the same problem. It would probably be perfect in the summer, though!"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,"Might work for you, but it doesn't work for me","I have combination skin that's very sensitive and reactive. I seriously dislike anything heavy and oily on my face, which is how my Clinique moisturizer was making me feel. I decided to take the plunge and make a switch to something new after using Clinique for several years. When I first applied this, I thought I had found the perfect replacement; no burning sensation on my sensitive skin, no fragrance, not oily at all, and it actually did a decent job of moisturizing my skin. As the days went on, my skin started to react more and more. I have been using this for about four days now, and my skin is not happy. I have tiny bumps all over my face, redness, extreme dryness and tightness. My face literally feels uncomfortable. On the second day, applying it did nothing to increase moisture. Today I decided to stop using this product in an attempt to save my skin before it gets even worse. This product might be for someone else but it's definitely not for me! My search continues."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,GREAT FOR COMBO SKIN,I have combination skin that is difficult to deal with especially in the winter. I have dry areas but my t-zone gets oily throughout the day which is worsened but standard moisturizers. I tried a sample of this and immediately noticed a huge difference! This moisturizer feels like it hydrates my skin but then dries down and leaves it soft and smooth. I love it so much I just bought the full size!
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Love it,"I have sensitive combination skin, with large pores and occasional breakouts. I use this cream daily morning and night. Over time, it has made my skin smoother and minimized my pores. It also absorbs quickly, no problem under my makeup. Very good price compared to women moisturizers. Highly recommend."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Best oil free moisturizer !,Light and amazing for acne prone skin!
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Holy Grail Moisturizer!,Received a sample of this in my birthday package! It’s the best moisturizer I’ve ever used. It’s thick and hydrating but not greasy! It’s makes your skin so soft.
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,"I love what this product has done for my face and neck. I have the most complicated complexion which is oily, acne prone, dry and very sensitive. This product has addressed all of my issues. Once, I added this product into my skin care routine I started to see changes to my face within a matter of days. There is less irritation, less dry patches, and my face doesn't seem as oily. I have also not had any acne pop up either. I use this product in the morning and of an evening."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,"everyday moisturizer light and clean
dont like the smell of it tho.but its perfect moisturizer!"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Best Moisturizer Ever!,"I absolutely love this product. It is the best moisturizer I have ever purchased and it works so well. You don't need a lot for your face, I usually use 1 pump, and it is nice and light. It doesn't have an overpowering scent. It is a little pricey but TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,AMAZING MOISTURIZER!,"AMAZING, affordable moisturizer.  I use it as my daytime moisturizer, and as a person with extremely oily skin, it's a relief to find a hydrating moisturizer that leaves my skin dry to the touch.  I started out with the sample and have now been using the full size for about a month . . . I've barely even made a dent.  This product is definitely worth the price, I even like it better than my Sunday Riley Tidal moisturizer, which was $65!"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Works wonders for my skin!,"I have tried many different moisturizers (many higher-end) but this one really works best for my combination skin! I first received it as a birthday sample, and then bought the full bottle because I loved how it feels on my skin so much! It really keeps it moisturized and doesn't break me out. If anything, I think my skin texture improved while using this product."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,My husband loves this,My husband uses this at night.  During the day he uses the Jack Black moisturizer with SPF.  He likes it because it is non-greasy.
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,My boyfriend doesn't like it... says it doens't last that long and he feels like he has to re-apply more very soon after.
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,the moisture isn't good for my skin.,"I received a birthday gift sample, my skin has sensitive and dry. I read the reviews about this. so I tried it and I dislike it because it was little itchy; I decided not to use it."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,CLEAN and FRESH,"The woman at Sephora looked at me like I was crazy to purchase a ""male"" moisturizer. It is AMAZING. It feels so clean and pure. No extra chemicals to clog your pores, no unnecessary fragrances. I love that you can wash your face at the end of the day, apply this, and still feel like you have the cleanest, freshest, hydrated skin ever! :)"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Best ever...,"Ok so at 47 I have tried hundreds of
Women's moisturizers all of which were scented, runny, and inadequate. Got this as a sample and am sold. Now bought the full size and it MUST be awesome as it is always out of stock as I had to wait for mine. Bought it and now it is out of stock again. That is because it is the best with no scent, great moisture for my skin type, and not too thick nor too thin.. wowza"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,"This product seems to too good to be true, yet it is. I have weird combo skin - my chin is slightly oily while the rest of my face is super dry. This moisturizes has not only hydrated BOTH oily and dry skin, but actually controlled my chin's shine. I've been using it for 5 days straight and my skin is very hydrated. I will purchase full size as soon as I can*.
*got this as a VIB sample."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,LOVE this product ! i got it on my sephora play box. It is perfect for someone like me with very very oily skin it moisturizes perfectly leaves my skin soft and oil-free!
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,"Not just for men, perfect for oily sensitive skin!","Jack Black doesn’t disappoint! I love this! This moisturizer after using any toner absorb right into your skin like a sponge! Ladies ever wonder why some men have beautiful skin, this is probably why!"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,"Received a sample in the mail as a free gift when I purchased an order online. Had no idea it was for men, used it, liked it. Very good under make up. Light and thin. Feels so great on the skin. Glad it doesn't have a maculine scent!! Happy about that"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,I got sample of this product and gave it to my brother and he loved it! Then I bought full size for him. He said the texture is light but powerful enough to moisturize his skin! I personally use their moisturizer with SPF and lip balm! Love this brand!
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,the GOAT,"This is my jam! It feels amazing when applied. It's soooooo fresh and lightweight. I love how it smells and how my skin just GLOWS after application. It's one of those things that just feels so nice that it actually makes you FEEL pretty. I have very sensitive, acne prone skin (like...cystic acne) and I swear my skin has cleared up every since I switched to this moisturizer. You get a lot of product for the price (Compared to women's moisturizers.  Come on, I was paying $45  for 1.3 oz. Girl. Bye.) This is an amazing moisturizer for both men and women. I literally recommend it to everybody."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Great Everyday Moisturizer,"I got this as a 100 reward perk. I was on the hunt for a new oil-free moisturizer as my current Fashion Fair oil-free one has sadly been discontinued. I was going to go for the Boscia oil-free green tea moisturizer after trying a sample. It was okay. Then I realized that's $38 for 1.7 oz versus Jack Black's $30 for 3.3 oz moisturizer. So I got this as a reward perk and I am glad I did. This stuff is great. What I like about men-based brands is there's no over-hyped marketing. All men care about is if it works. It does. It's oil-free, and doesn't leave my T-zone shiny throughout the day. It has a smooth gel-cream texture but just melts into your skin. I believe it's fragrant free, I don't smell anything. It has a soothing feeling on the skin. And my makeup glides right over it. It's just a really nice, no fuss, soothing moisturizer that does what it claims."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,great lotion,"No scent, no irritation, moisturizing and smooth"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,I love to wear at night,"My favorite mask, it leaves my skin soft and with a sensational aroma"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,JACK BLACK Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,My son loves this moisturizer. It balances out his combination teenage skin.
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Perfect for Oily/Combination Skin - Men & Women,"My husband received the sample size as a gift and never used it. I randomly tried and was absolutely surprised by the product. 
My skin is really dry after cleaning but after about 2 hrs or in the afternoon my skin gets really oily and shiny. I feel like my skin adsorbs this product really quickly and is still provided enough moisturizer because I don't feel any grease hours after putting in on and it stays under my makeup perfectly. My makeup doesn't melt away like before so I'm really happy. 
I have spent so much money to find a product that might help my skin. I haven't had any new acne since I started using this. The price is incredible too <3"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Meh,I got this product as a free birthday sample. It is refreshing but it does absolutely nothing for me. It dries up too quickly on my skin and not even 5 minutes later I have to reapply a different lotion just to get rid of the dryness.
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,love it!,Great moisturizer- light and not heavy.. good for women too!
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Perfection!,"This stuff is currently my holy grail moisturizer. I tried it as a birthday gift despite it being for men and haven't looked back. I have extremely oily skin with a propensity for the occasional pimple... mostly the under the skin cysts, and my face loves it. It's lightweight enough to sit under makeup and has really helped calm down my oil production. I also love that it doesn't have a scent!"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,very amazing,i have the most oily face Ever and this Works wonders for me. its creamy and fun to apply but IT does not create any heavy feeling. IT absorbs quickly and the smell is not masculine at all. the bottle is suprisingly big for the price and a Little goes a long way. love love
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Great moisturizer,"Pro's: not much of a scent to it, absorbs quickly, provides light moisture (would probably be better for those with skin on the oily side), leaves skin feeling soft and clean and zero irritation with my super sensitive skin.
Con's: for those with dryer skin (like myself, super dry and super sensitive) it may not provide enough moisture, especially in harsher or dryer weather conditions (I live in the desert, so winter time is brutal on my skin)."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Nice Moisturizer,"I have combination sensitive skin. My t-zone gets oily and cheeks are dry. This works moisturizer for me most of the time. I use a couple different products during the week, but have learned to use a richer night moisturizer after some of those other products. Otherwise this moisturizer leaves my skin still pretty dry when I use the stronger cleaners. I like this for my almost-every day moisturizer."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,great,"I got this as a birthday gift from Sephora and it's great for oily skin. After I used my cleanser, I used this moisturizer and it instantly calmed down my oily skin. I've been wearing for about an hour now and my face isn't that oily."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Favourite Moistutizer!,I love this product. It's one of the cheaper moisturizers that they sell at Sephora. I break out really easily so I usually opt for oil free moisturizers. The problem with oil free moisturizers is that my skin usually feels dry even after I use it. BUT this moisturizer did not do that! It totally hydrated my skin and it didn't give me break outs!  My go to day &a night moisturizer!
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,I LOOK FORWARD TO PUTTING IT ON,I'm very low maintenance so much so I have no beauty rituals I abide by  I try to keep up with my Ole Henriksen eye cream every night but unfortunately I don't but with this AMAZING product I look forward to putting this stuff on I have combo skin dry on cheeks and dropping oil on t zone practically and I soon realized like most products it's a scam when there's ANY OIL in a product it will enlarge your pores and that's no fun so you buy a product to dry you out in hopes of balancing but really your skin accounts for the dryness and makes double your natural oil plus yours putting oil infused product on your face it's a vicious cycle but this stuff gives you a CLEAN BREAK FROM THAT VICIOUS CYCLE I'm freeeee yay!! but I was afraid to even moisturize my oily spots but I wanted to see if this stuff really works and omg my face is balanced after using consistently for less than just a week this stuff gives me hope of a less wrinkly future like I said I'm low maintenance but this stuff will MOST DEFINITELY BE MY NO.1 STAPLE BEAUTY PRODUCT there is nothing better I bet my life on it (:
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,LOVE,"Received this as part of the birthday gift, been using it daily and I'm in love. Will have to purchase the full size next month when my budget allows it. Absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves it feeling less oily. Already noticeable improvement in my acne, which makes it one of my favorite moisturizers rather quickly. No regrets here."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,wonderful!,This product is definitely not just for men. I received a deluxe sample with my free birthday gift. I've been using it day and night and it has really improved the oiliness of my combo skin. It sits nicely under foundation as well. I currently use the Clinique moisturizing gel but am considering switching to this. I love that the full size is affordable and comes in a pump (nice and sanitary). I'm trying to convince my husband to start using this brand too as I have yet to be disappointed!
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,for women with combo skin,"This gel moisturizer is amazing! I bought it as a cheaper alternative to DE's B-hydra and love it!!! My skin gets breakouts - although I almost 30 - and this has completely helped. I have seen a difference and I only get the normal hormonal breakouts on my chin now and not as often! I use DE framboise serum for those and it helps big time.
If your oily it is a must have! My combo skin loves it but being that it's winter time I use a heavier cream at night. I think this will be the perfect spring/summer lotion. The price point is so good that it works perfectly for what I wanted. I like to use a heavier cream and vitamin c serum at night."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Perfect,"I bought this immediately when I saw this
I have a very oily skin with acne problems
So I can only use oil-free moisturizer
This one is perfect!!!
The packaging is very well design
This moisture gives me the moisture I need without give me a greasy feeling 

I use this at night at the last step
during daytime I use the Jack Black's double duty moisture with SPF
This combo works so well for me

Highy recommend to oily skin"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Absorbs quickly,"Blown away! I do not like sticky oily rich face products. Got a sample from Sephora, thought why not give it a try. Omg I was so happy at how it wasn't oily and sticky, absorbed right away. Love it, will be purchasing the full size. Reminds me of my Clinique gel cream. What a find, so excited to have this."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,I FOUND IT!!!!,"Ok I'm going to start by saying that my face is super oily....like SUPER oily. Like I blot my face multiple times a day and every moisturizer is crazy heavy. Well let me tell you....I got a sample through an online order I placed, which Sephora, by the way, providing those samples is genius, because I thought ""meh...I think this is supposed to be for men, not really sure, but whateves, I will try it."" I'm floored by this moisturizer because it is PERFECT for my skin. It feels like it hydrates, it's not heavy at all, I don't need to blot until like noon now (before I would legit blot by like 8:30 am) and it feels so nice!! I love love love this stuff and ended up buying it. It's my new go-to and I think Sephora needs to advertise this one more!!!!!"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,ARE YOU SERIOUS,"I was on a hunt for a trouble-free breakout-free It's-just-sitting-on-my-skin-free moisturizer. I have a few items already on their way because I hadn't found the right one. This fell through the sephora search cracks and I am completely appalled at that it did! I used the sample and IT WAS AMAZING. All the breakout dissipated and I'm going to keep using it to see if it helps to restore my skin to pre-breakout condition. So far though, PRAISE!"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,love that will stay,"I've been on a hunt for that perfect, oil free,moisturizer that's in a pump that will keep me moisturized but not feeling greasy. This product is amazing. It comes  in 3.3 oz which is fairly alot compared to others which is usually around 1.7oz. It comes in a pump, and the price is fair. I have combo and oily tzone and this moisturizer feels so light weight and sinks right in. No hassel whatsoever with this one. I have finally found The One. People with dry skin might not dig this product like i do since it's very light weight and it's definitely more for oilyskinned people.  I never knew a men's product was so good!"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,moisturizer?,"Jack black makes alot of ""summer""moisturizers. Clean break,double duty etc etc. Im not saying this is a bad product, It just doesnt work for me in harsh Canadian winters. If u have very dry skin do yourself a favour and go for Jack black dry erase Instead. If your face is an oil slick year round this clean break is your golden ticket. I may try again in the summer. It cost too much to toss."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Great gel-moisturizer,"This is one of the only moisturizers that don't break me out because it has amazing ingredients!!! it's oil-free, organic and i love how quick it absorbs into the skin. Awesome product but honestly it doesn't do anything to keep oil at bay."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,amazing!,I have oily acne prone skin and struggle finding a moisturizer that doesn't break me out or feel greasy yet is still hydrating. This product fits my needs perfectly!
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,loooove it!!!!,"I bought this for my husband! First I didn't know how is going to work for him and I kept reading the reviews, and I decided to buy it ! It's a great purchase . Is his first official men's moisturizer , cause he always was using mine) is great! It's so soft and light, moisturizes the skin and you don't feel it like greesy or something... I was thinking  to try it too)) I like the consistency so much. And I'm thinking to buy more products from this brand. Like face wash and something for wrinkles too. 
It is worth the cost!!!! I highly recommend it!"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,let me count the ways...,"I am so in love! I have very oily, acne prone skin and this is amazing! First, I love the pump. Keeps it clean and sanitary which is especially important if you're acne prone. Second, I don't even need a full pump to cover my face. Third, it's very thick and moisturizing and a little goes a long way. Fourth, it dries matte! It is not oily at all and it helps keeps me matte throughout the way! This is the most amazing moisturizer!"
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,so oily!,"I received a sample of this product, and had high hopes when I put it on. It did feel weightless, so I'll give it a second star. However, within just a few hours I was wiping oil off my forehead, which I don't usually have a problem with. So disappointed."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,HOLY GRAIL moisturizer,"This is the BEST moisturizer I have ever used. I have relatively dry skin, but I hate using thick and heavy moisturizers. This stuff is so light and yet still so hydrating and toning! My face feels like a baby's face. This brand is technically marketed to men (I am a woman), but the consultant I spoke with in the store told me it was actually created by two wives, and I have to say that I think it works great for any gender. I highly recommend this stuff."
JACK BLACK-Clean Break Oil-Free Moisturizer,USA,Perfect,"I bought this for my husband because he loved the sample I got for him at Sephora. He says it's hands down the best moisturizer he's ever used. It helps keep his face shine free, too."
KENZOKI-Hydration Flow Short Night Sleeping Mask,Singapore,not good to use ,"not good to use , this was introduced by the Kenzo Promoter said is good but not good at all not worth buying ans expensive and regretted buying ......."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Moisturizer Refill Pod,Australia,the best! ,"love this moisturizer so much! I have sensitive skin prone to eczema, this moisturizer is very calming & soothing. The formula is rich & creamy smells divine too. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Moisturizer Refill Pod,Australia,Turmeric moisturiser that’s divine,This is a game changer! It’s made a very noticeable difference to my skin. I love it. Can’t say enough good things about it.
LAB SERIES-Daily Rescue Energizing Gel Cream,Malaysia,gel cream,"Awesome lotion.a little greasy,but Is eventually absorbed. My skin has never looked better. Looks and feels well hydrated. Great alternative to Lab Series Max ...
"
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,Singapore,disappointed with the scent,"The texture is alright, easily absorbed on the face.  unfortunately, I cannot stand the rubbery scent of the product.  would have given it a higher score if not for the scent which puts me off.  "
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,Malaysia,Not hydrating enough,"Have used up half of the bigger tube and I still couldn’t get it to work for my postpartum 30year old combi/dry skin. Doesn’t get absorbed into the skin quick enough so leaves a slightly tacky feeling & I certainly couldn’t use this on its own to hydrate my skin. I quite like the spa smell that you get & the packaging is really cute. However, I won’t be continuing to use this as a moisturiser, probably just as a lip balm or something. "
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,Singapore,"good moisturizer, has a slight funky smell ",Great for massaging into your face or mixing with retinol. Dries slowly and does not look shiny on the skin. Pump design would be easier to use as you have to deal with unscrewing and screwing back the cap. Has a slight funky smell. 
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,Australia,Beautiful ,"A beautiful  all in one cream that I believe to be worth every penny. It really does work as a serum day or night & as a moidturider, night creme or just used on bare skin. Highly  recommended "
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,Australia,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"This is the 2nd last step to my skincare routine and I love it......when someone suggested to me to add a lightweight moisteriser before my main moisteriser I thought it would be too much but it isnt, by adding this product my skin is more supple and leaves it beautoful and glass like in appearance.....have jsut ordered a backup for when i run out. I also liek to use this in morning b4 my morning walk when i first get up and not doing my whole routine just this and sunscreen for the walk"
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,Malaysia,Wonderful Product,"I've never felt a moisturiser work so well before. 
Highly recommend this to everyone. 
After application, it's like it just sinks in. Keeps my skin hydrated all night even without a sleep mask in an AC room.

It has a mild scent which reminds me of my great grandmother. Not a bad scent, but it definitely doesn't smell like flowers... "
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,Singapore,Great texture and feels replenished,"I have a combination matured skin. The smell was a little strange (in a good way) at first. The first time I applied it, it feels great and absorbs easily into my skin. I’m the previous user of innisfree serum which is much more watery but my skin has matured and not able to absorb it that well anymore. This is my new beau. Definitely buying the bigger version. Highly recommend. "
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,Australia,Lovely neutral moisturiser ,"Feels and smells amazing and soaks in well, and a great vehicle for the retinol serum. Doesn’t seem to work as well on its own, but makes an ok light night creme."
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,New Zealand,Great,"Half the fun of this is the gorgeous minimal packaging, but it works well, though less fragrance or an unfragranced version might be better. Will be back for the large version I think."
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,Malaysia,Miss,"First time use this product. Thought it would be oily, it is more than expectation where it is not sticky and oily even for whole night. I use together with Lixir retinol."
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,Australia,a very nice moisturiser ,"This moisturiser smells very nice, glides on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling plump and soft. I use this mixed with the retinol night serum and it’s a great combination. Would buy again. "
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,Australia,Smells beautiful!,"Wow is all I can say! I really love this universal emulsion, it’s perfect. It hydrates and smells like heaven of creamy roses. I love it! I will be getting more in the future and that is definite."
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,Singapore,Amazing mositurizer,"I have a normal to oily skin. I enjoy using the product because of the lightweight and gel like texture that melts into the skin very quickly. It moisturized my skin very well and works perfectly under make up. The scent is a bit strong but goes away after a bit. My skin feels stronger, likely because of the peptides in it. Highly recommend. "
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,Singapore,3 in 1 Moisturizer,"Love it!! I’m a skincare junkie. Was super impressed with this as this was a random purchase. Super cute packaging. Like a hand cream look. Slightly pricier for a basic moisturiser but its more like a 3 in 1 product so thats ok. This product gives me a dewy look, maybe slight matte unlike other products that usually claim of giving a dewy finish but looks more greasy. It actually makes my skin look healthy! However, it does smells kind of weird. Like rubbery playdough kind? If you’re particular of smells, probably can skip this. It is light weight, slight watery. Also, it does not actually dissolves into your skin therefore there is no smooth to touch feeling. Not sticky too just feel kind of rubbery.  Overall quite happy with this. Would definately purchase again! "
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,Australia,Staple,"Loved it so much I bought a full-sized and another and another lols, This is a lovely moisturiser which works well with the night switch serums. Will continue to repurchase."
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,Australia,Wonderful,"Very good facial cream, mixes well with both of the night switch serums, even applying alone it works well, absorbs fast, doesn't leave my combo skin feeling too oily or dry, have repurchased a few times and will continue to do so."
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,Australia,Ms,"Amazing product with many uses, filled with natural ingredients and a beautiful soft scent that leaves skin soft smooth and glowing, will continue to order."
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,,Beautiful smelling g and effective moisturiser ,"I have been using Lixir products for two years now and love the simplicity of this product line. Each product does exactly what it’s supposed to do. 
I use the Lixir cleanser in the evening and follow this with the universal moisturiser. I can honestly say that it has improved my skin’s clarity and evenness and this routine is just the easiest you will ever come across. 
Totally recommend this brand. All products!
"
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,,50ml - nice basic moisturiser,"This is a very good basic product, it doesn't leave your skin feeling oily and pairs very well with the Lixir serums.  The scent isn't overpowering and a little goes a long way with this."
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,,Love the packaging ,"Smells very herbal and spa-like and might not be for everyone from the scent alone. However it does give a nice dewy look once settled into the skin and I mostly loved the fact that its multi-purpose so it’s worth my money. Packaging is also very hygienic, convenient and instagrammable."
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,,Not hydrating enough for me,"Sadly i was disappointed in this product. I think the claims that it is a nigh cream/day cream serum all in one is a bit far fetched. I think it would be OK for a young skin, but if you are over 30 then this quite possibly wont be enough hydration, it certainly was not for me.

The texture is very liquid (more like a lotion then a cream) and has a very strong scent. It's a pass for me."
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,,A little goes a long way,"This leaves my skin feeling so supple and smooth, and I wake up with the softest skin the next day, especially when I mix it with the Elixir retinol serum!"
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,,Excellent all rounder ,"Creamy but not oily, gentle and hydrating but doesn’t clog pores, nice mild scent, and generous amount in tube. What’s not to love about this product?! Doesn’t do anything fancy like help with wrinkles or brighten skin, but perfect to put over a good serum :)"
LIXIRSKIN-Universal Emulsion,,love! ,"I love that this is a multi use product. I can use it on my eyes, face and hands! It’s made my routine so simple! It has a beautiful scent and doesn’t feel too greasy or sticky and rubs in perfectly! Def worth every penny"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Almost Unbearable Scent,"I have been using this for a couple of weeks now hoping that I would get used to the scent, but I just can't. It smells like burning plastic and the smell doesn't dissipate after being applied. The scent lingers all day. Unfortunately, I will have to return this."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Australia,great product,I wanted a 2 in 1 product that joined a high THD vit c and moisturiser- and this does it all. I had a noticeably better complexion after 3 weeks. I had soo many compliments! The smell is different but it didn’t put me off. What a great product 👍🏼 I have purchased multiple times
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,One of the best!,"I really like this vitamin C cream. It definitely helps even out my skin tone and helps with little expression lines. I actually enjoy the aroma it gives off. Effective vitamin C is supposed to have that kind of smell and I’m weary of vitamin C products that don’t have at least a hint of that fragrance. I only took a star off because the packaging isn’t the best and makes it oxidize faster. I put mine in the fridge and it significantly helps slow down that process. It also has a slightly gritty feeling at first, but that’s expected with effective vitamin C creams. It’s perfect for summer and works wonderfully under sunscreen. I’ll definitely be repurchasing like I have been."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Horrible smell,I wanted to love this and felt alright on the skin but couldn’t stand the horrible smell. The smell is sooo bad. Hopefully they will do something about that.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,"Love this.  LOVE IT.

I’m 37, and am also an esthetician (no, this isn’t a paid review….).

I’ve found this product absorbs well.  If you’ve got sensitive skin - this product might be too harsh for you.  There’s a mild tingle sensation, which can be off putting to some.  The smell is okay - not my favorite, but I’m sure once fall comes around, it’ll make me feel a bit more festive.  But it’s not lingering.

I feel like it plumps my skin (in a good way), and is evening out my skin tone.  This is about one of 10-15 products I use it in my daily skin care regime…but it for sure has a permanent place.  A little goes a LONG way!! I feel like this product will probably last me anywhere from 4-6 months, using daily, sometimes 2x daily."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Australia,Ms,"Love this product but the order took nearly a month to arrive, way too long. I paid extra as it included 2 free samples but only 1 arrived, feel cheated! What is with this??? Please explain!!!!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Australia,i wanted more out of this ,"I really wanted more out of this. I love PTR and most of their other products but this didn’t really wow me so I wouldn’t purchase it again, not for that price point. "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Australia,best product,"Omg I can’t believe how good my skin looks and feels after using this cream. I have used a lot of Peter Thomas Roth products and this is by far my favourite. It has a really nice smell as well, but the look of my skin is amazing. "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Plumping !!!,"Potent-C is exactly rhat and makes your face bright and plump, I find it truly amazing and I have used most everything high-end.At 70 years young I'm always looking for the ideal skincare and I am really quite impressed with this moisturizer. For reference I have normal to dry mature skin, very thin and pale and I baby it like crazy. I purchased the kit with this and the Pumpkin Enzyme combination and I swear it looks like I just had a facial, I love it. It really does what it claims and so quickly, at least for me, everyone is different. My skin is sensitive and you can feel lt working, I find the sensation soothing and love my skin whether I wear it during the day, with or without makeup, no problem, and every night for a month now. Some may find it heavy so I would suggest it's more appropriate for drier skin vs oily, it may be too much. It definitely worked for me, hope it does for you too!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,love it,I have been using this every night for over 6 months. All my spots are almost gone. My skin looks glowing and plump. I already have a backup jar. I have no complaints about the smell. It smells like citrus then minutes later it dissipates.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,I used this for YEARS until they reformulated it. I used to swear by it. Now it smells like hot dog water. I miss the old formula.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Singapore,love it! ,love how it moisturisers.  and the fragrance is amazing.  I love this brand especially this collection. this is my second product purchase within this collection!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,The smell was terrible and I felt like it irritated my skin and wasn’t moisturizing at all. Stopped using it and purchased something else. Would not recommend trying
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Australia,absolutely not satisfactory ,"Smells disgusting.
Looks way different than photo.
Looks super sticky and smells absolutely disgusting.
I would Never ever buy this product again in my life .
"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Australia,Peter Thomas vitamin C moisturiser ,"This product is terrible after 4 uses it left my skin looking like an orange peel. It irritated , burnt and left my skin so sore and itchy. The worst moisturiser ever. After 2 weeks my skin looks terrible 😩😢"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,New Zealand,wow.,"After reading such a mix of good and bad reviews I wasn't sure about this product. But the 20 percent of Sale had me feeling frivolous and I purchased the large pottle.      My skin is noticeably different, in particular I have two large forehead lines and they are noticeably smaller well mostly gone. All of my lines in fact are noticeably smaller. My skin is softer, plump, it's hydrated and it stays hydrated all day which is something I have always struggled with.  You only need the smallest amount to do your face and neck, it's thick but it glides on like butter.     Absolutely in love. "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,"The smell of this is OFFENSIVE. It’s like cloves and an overripe orange have been shoved up your nose. Truly makes me gag every time I put it on my face and I am not one usually sensitive to smells. I would return if I hadn’t bought it in a set with the pumpkin enzyme mask (which is amazing). Moisturizer as a product is okay, but definitely not worth the stench."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Australia,my fav moisturizer ,I LOVE it - my all time favorite. I have used for over 10 years. It has a rich creamy texture that plumbs the skin whilst the potent vitamin C assists with Anti-aging. It feels lovely in the skin. It works. 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Medicinal Smell,"I’m trying this product out, only on day 2. I’m trying to get past the smell. It does not wear off, I smell it even later in the day. Hopefully the benefits will outweigh the smell. So far, feels good going on. Maybe I feel greasy if worn during the day but not quite sure yet."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Singapore,Ms,"Wonderful product that does what it claims. Skin became better with use. However, the overpowering scent is unpleasant and the colour of the product renders my skin yellowish after application. Will be great if the scent is more pleasant and it is in a colour that is complimentary to women. "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Felt nice - but smelled horrible!,"I just started with this Vitamin C moisturizer and serum. After the first use I thought my skin felt smoother and softer. However, this product has a horrible smell!  I’m hoping I become accustomed to the odor. I tried it in the store on my hand and didn’t notice the smell - but I sure noticed it when I put it on my face. If it improves wrinkles I will just have to get used to the odor."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,"Leaves my skin plump and moisturized. I was pleasantly surprised at how thick this cream is. You only need a little bit to moisturize your entire face and neck. The scent is not offensive to me at all, and it definitely doesn’t smell like hot dogs. I’m vegetarian so I definitely wouldn’t put anything that smells like meat on my face. It just smells like a skincare product. If you’re on the fence because of the comments about the smell go to a store and smell it yourself. I’ve been using this in conjunction with the Pumpkin Enzyme Mask and my dark marks have faded so much in only a few weeks."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Smell and texture,"This product looks so promising. The ingredient list is amazing. So I bought it. Go home, open it, and then the smell. It is a rooty plant smell. It tried putting in on and the smell made me so nauseated I had to wash it off. It has a brown/gold color so you have to rub it in really well. Also, it is very thick, heavy, and oily. It is practically a solid, like coconut oil before you melt it. It has a cooling feeling too.  I feel like with all the products out there to choose from and for the price, you can definitely find something that works just as well and is more pleasant to use."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,"I’ve used this product for about 4 days,not quiet a full week. I noticed in the morning after applying this the night before, my pores on my cheeks appear larger. I have never noticed that before. I think I will be returning my skin just didn’t like it"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Smells like bacon,Smells horrible!!! Just like bacon!! I will probably return it.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,I LOVE IT,"I am surprised to see this product with negative reviews. I have melasma and this product has helped me tremendously with the dark spots. I have been using this since 2018. 
Leave it in the fridge and take it out when you want to use it. 
It would not only give you a cooling feeling but also make the product last longer."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,"Bought as a trial size because I read that vitamin c is best when stabilized with ferulic acid and vitamin e. This trial size was the cheapest vit c with ferulic acid and vit e that I could find. There is a smell to it but personally it’s not bothersome, unsure how to describe it. Product glides on with ease, it’s like buttery spreadable. It is somewhat thick and I don’t use much. Use with sunscreen for added sun protection benefit."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Singapore,Don’t bother ,"This is my third PTR product. And I must say all
The products have disappointed me consistently. This again did not do anything for my skin. In fact my skin broke out very badly. Again the fragrance is too overwhelming and product is greasy. "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Malaysia,okok,It’s alright. Not much difference to my skin. Try the smaller bottle first if you are unsure. It made my skin plump but not as bright or radiant as i hope. I’d still choose sunday riley over this brand. 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,I love this. I was having some weird dry skin situation that I couldn’t get to the bottom of and this fixed me up real quick. Idk why everyone’s upset about the smell y’all need to grow up this product is amazing! Worth every penny.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,"So, about the smell...","I didn’t read the reviews for this product until after purchasing, and I’m happy I didn’t see them until afterward. I probably would have been discouraged by the reviews regarding the smell. But the smell doesn’t bother me at all. As of matter of fact, the smell was very familiar to me. I realized this product smells the exact same as the Vitamin C Ester Brightening Serum from Perricone MD. And both products have the main ingredient, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, so the scent may just come with the territory no matter what product you use with this ingredient. I understand though, we’re all sensitive to smells in some way. So I would STRONGLY recommend you try a sample before purchasing to see if you can deal with the scent. It’s an unusual, sort of citrusy scent. But the moisturizer works great and does everything it claims to do. I do not have sensitive skin, but I do have very oily skin and it’s not even greasy. It leaves my skin even toned and glowing. I use this in combination with Niacinimide products to treat dark spots and I am extremely pleased. Again, just try a sample first if you’re worried about the smell."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,PTR great quality,"This product is amazing. My skin was instantly brighter after just 1 night. I use 3 PTR products. I’m 39 and my skin looks 25. I swear by the quality.

It does have a smell, like turmeric and pumpkin but it doesn’t bother me & fades fast. LOL I wonder how many people complaining about the smell also stick needles in their face :)"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,VOMITOUS SMELL,STINKS! Smells so bad. I’m not even very particular about scent. This literally reeks. Unusable. P.U.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Singapore,beauty is pain,love this moisturiser as it packs so much vit c my skin is visibly brighter after a week of usage. it stings a bit on my skin upon applying but the sensation is not too annoying. it fades after a few seconds.  
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Singapore,Yet to Discover,"I am a fan of most Peter Thomas Roth products but this one I've tried applying it on my face for 3 nights now after my usual serum and I don't see any compelling evidence that it is doing any work on my skin. A little thick and oily for me though as I've already had oily skin to begin with. Compared with other PTR products, I still prefer my water drenched hyaluronic cloud cream as it lightweight and doesn't give me a greasy skin the morning after. Will give it a shot for another week or two and see if any changes."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,"This evens out and brightens skin tone. Also helped out with some of pigmentation. The smell is a bit of for me, but this is a personal preference. I recommend it, but the “moisturizing” part is little lacking. I use this with another moisturizer, and will definitely repurchase it."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,My product appeared to be oxidized when it arrived. The color was brown instead of light orange. Also the description on Sephora says that it can be used for oily skin but PTR website says that they do not recommend this product for oily skin.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Malaysia,Great product ,Love this moisturiser and it really helped to reduce my dark spot and brighten my skin.. the smell is little strong but I’m ok with it. This moisturiser also helped to reduce my fine lines.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,"Smells fine, you're just used to flowery smells.","I got this as a birchbox sample and liked it enough to buy the full thing. It's a little thick, but I guess I like that sort of thing. I'm really pale and this made me look uh...healthier? Guess I need to eat more oranges.

As for the smell, at first I thought it smelled like barbecue sauce, because it had a familiar scent but I couldn't exactly place it..after wearing it frequently I've pinpointed that it smells like that pinecone potpourri your mom puts by the fireplace on Christmas. It's really not unpleasant, just not something people are used to their skincare smelling like."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Australia,miss ,I bought the smaller size to try and would be repurchasing it if it were in stock. I use this as a day off moisturiser. It’s quite thick and has a strong scent that I don’t mind. I feel it’s maybe too heavy for under makeup however I haven’t tried it. It definitely leaves my skin feeling so incredibly soft and plump and I enjoy it on no makeup days as it makes my skin glow. I have sensitive skin and have no issues with this however I am reluctant to use it everyday as I feel it is quite a potent formula and my skin doesn’t like strong ingredients constantly so I alternate. But I definitely love this product
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Great Addition to the Serum,"Great moisturizer for coming to dry skin.
I use the drum first, and this on top of it before I apply sunscreen and makeup. Love this whole line. Doesn’t irritate my skin and I can see the glowing results."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,I have really dry skin and this moisturizer actually keeps me hydrated throughout the day. My skin feels so soft and supple. The smell isn’t the best but disappears.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Great Product,Great product it is thick I would recommend someone more on the dry skin or in winter. Leaves my face smooth and dewy radiant for sure. The smell it's a little strong smells like Turmeric but smell does go away nothing you can't handle. Love all the skin benefits it has.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Great moisturizer for mature skin!,I love this moisturizer coupled with the serum. It has helped my fine lines and makes my skin look healthy and radiant.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,New Zealand,My HG Moisturizer,"I've now used up two full size tub of this so I'm ready to give it a review. I have dehydrated, oily and sensitive skin and been trying a bunch of moisturizer to help with the dry winter. None of them really did anything and I had to put occlusive on top as my skin was so dry and flaky. I saw this PTR line thought to give it a try. Let me tell you, it has changed my skin completely. True to its name, my skin was flaky and dull, now it is bright and plump, all due to this moisturizer as I haven't changed anything else in my routine. I don't have to put anymore occlusive as this moisturizer does the job fine on its own. My makeup goes on nicely and smoothly now. There is a smokey smell to it due to the vitamin C but it doesn't bother me, I prefer this to artificial perfume smell. Overall my skintone has improved but I haven't notice lightening of my sun spots. I'm a happy customer and will continue to purchase."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Malaysia,🍊,Not sure if it just me but there’s scent to it I do not quite like. I think it is an okay product but much too expensive. I dont feel it is a game changer to my regime so probably will not be repurchasing
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Singapore,Oxidised when I received ,"It's hard for me to review this as I received a bad one didn't get to use any, colour was orangey, expired or oxidised I assume. I do smell bacon like everybody else. So I returned it and got my refund."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,stinky,"I purchased this months ago but due to the extremely bad smell (not sure what smells worse, this or barf) I never wore it. During this quarantine time figured I should use it as it’s pretty pricey and can’t let it go to waste. I love how my face looks more awake/refreshed on a daily basis. It does work!!!! BUT due to the horrid smell I will not purchase again unless it gets redesigned to odorless... or even damn flowers. But this is the stinkiest thing I’ve ever smelled"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Australia,soft and glowing,i have been using this almost everyday and i'm halfway through the product 😢 it doesn't leave my skin sticky like how other moisturisers have done before on me. it still feels light. it was worth it. i will be buying a biggest size next time though. 20ml is not enough for me 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Australia,Wow 😍,I Love love love this product! It worked amazingly on my skin. I have a very sensitive skin and this worked really well for me! This is my second week of using it and I already can see a huge difference. Sooo worth the money I’ll definitely be purchasing this moisturiser again 😍
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,"Didn’t really help my fine lines at all, just made my face super greasy and smell like hot dogs. Yuck."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,stay away,"Stay away. I used this with the vitamin C serum and it broke me out in white bumps in jaw and chin area, at first wasnt sure what was breaking me out so i stopped using this moisturizer and my skin is healing. Plus the smell is terrible like smoked salmon."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Great product,"This has been a great product. It’s brightened my skin and smoothed my skin texture. I use it after the Peter Thomas Roth anti aging cleanser. My skin has never looked better. The smell is not bad, it’s smells like spices to me. The texture of this is so rich, but even if I put too much on it soaks into my skin nicely. I’m hooked."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,"I received this as a gift, at first I thought it was working (very very slowly) but I’m pretty sure that was just a serum I was using along with it because once I ran out of the serum and couldn’t get more right away I just used to moisturizer and it made me red and over time I started developing small white bumps on my cheeks and jaw. Now my skin feels terrible :/"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Australia,Hey Pete! ,What a glorious product!!!!! Really works wonders for my skins with noticeable results after only a few short weeks. Recommended this moisteriser to anyone looking to step up their routine! 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,Australia,broke me out ,"For the price this product is, it is not worth it at all! It completely broke me out and now my skin has acne everywhereeeeee! It is also extremely thick which leaves my face feeling heavy & oily rather than fresh and smooth"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Terrible moisturizer,"Awful moisturizer.  The smell is bad, and the consistency is even worse.  I think it actually irritates my skin more from how hard you have to work to get it to rub in.  Leaves me red and greasy.  Will not repurchase."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,STINKS,"Oh my goodness this stinks!!! Feels heavy on my skin, and the smell Does. Not. Fade. At all. I can smell it on me like burnt rubber all day long. PEW!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,,Bright and Plump,I like the hydration of this better than the Peter Thomas Roth hyaluronic cloud moisturizer. But this is a tad oily.. Good for colder weather rather than summer. 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,"I purchased this is the 3-piece set and have left a review under that product description.

First things first, the smell is from the turmeric in the moisturizer. If you can get past it, this product is worth keeping UNLESS you also have the Serum. I say that because this product has 10% vitamin C in it and the serum has 20% vitamin C in it. I don't feel I need both.
I like this moisturizer for night time use because it's so thick, it makes me sweat more when I use it during the day time. It goes on smoothly and has brightened/evened out my complexion. 

I recommend this if you have dry skin because it's so thick AND if you don't already use a vitamin C based product."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,"I was recommended this by a sephora employee, and I'm on my second jar. I haven't noticed drastic brightening results, but as a disclaimer, I'm in my early 20s with no serious skincare conditions or issues. I use this nightly after a lengthy skincare routine, and I chose it for the Vitamin E, vitamin C alternative, and hydrolyzed collagen. I also have really sensitive skin, and this was safe for me! I'll probably keep using this as a night cream unless something else amazing comes out, I really have no complaints."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Stay away,"I bought this on the recommendation from a Sephora associate, however not only does it not hydrate, but it made my skin rough and scaly."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Great moisturizer,I’ve been using this for a month and really love it. It is silky without being greasy. Absorbs into my skin leaving a great texture for my foundation (without needing an additional primer). My only negative comment is the smokey scent...it has a slight burnt smell when applying; however that smell doesn’t linger.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,worth it!,"I’m so confused by people who are surprised by the smell. Does it smell like hot dogs? Yes, yes it does. Every potent vitamin c serum I’ve ever used has smelled exactly the same no matter the brand.

This is very effective on my post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. I’ve seen a noticeable difference in my skin in just a week. It’s a nice, rich moisturizer. I’m acne prone but no issues with clogged pores or breakouts. The scent fades in an hour or so and to me, the benefits are so worth smelling like a sausage cart temporarily."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,LOVE!!!,"LOVE!  I use Potent C Serum and was interested in trying this as a moisturizer and OMG.  I’m a big believer in vitamin C in skincare and THD is amazing!  People compliment my skin quite a bit and I truly equate it to the vitamin C products I use.  I see a lot of people complain about the scent, but it doesn’t bother me at all.  I would much rather have an active product with quality ingredients than one that smells nice."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,,Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,this does plump up my face but it smells like expired curry sauce. a little amount goes a long way. I do notice it brighten my face the next day and lighten pimple mark faster than regular moisturizer. 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,I love this product! I noticed my skins dryness immediately disappear and appear much brighter. Other posts mention that they don't love the smell but believe me it is not that bad and the results are what matters!  I will definatly be continuing to use this product!!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,BEWARE,used this in conjunction with the PTR Cloud Cleanser   serum so I am unsure which of them harmed me but I am experiencing a CRAZY breakout of little white bumps all over my face. my normally smooth skin feels like sandpaper after using this for ~2weeks. the only things I changed in my routine were these 3 products. I am so so upset. seeing my derm Friday. Stay away :( never ever had this happen to me
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,I absolutely can say this is my favorite moisturizer. I ran out of Potent C and went back to a different one that I had been using before and found such a difference that I went right back to Sephora to buy more Potent C.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,,not really like it,"Smells bad, very thick cream, not really like it unfortunately, a bit burn (has like spicy things) its for plumping I guess, but the serum was amazingggg I felt a bit lifted my skin, i really recommend the serum save your money for it better than this cream "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Can't Get Over The Smell,"Really wanted to love this, the formula seems great, it's a nice thick moisturizer and it really is plumping. But it literally smells like I added a drop of liquid smoke to my routine lol! It really bothers me and I smell it all day. That being said I am very sensitive and picky with odors, fragrances, etc."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,The Best,"This stuff is awesome! You are getting a more effective vitamin C than,for instance, glow recipe pineapple C."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Great Product,"This is a great product for people like me who want more of an “all in one”. I bought this because I like the idea of Vitamin C and moisturizer combined. I use it in the AM only as I use a heavier moisturizer at night. I am expecting my first baby in a couple months and knew I would not have time for an extensive morning skin care routine and liked that this was a more all in one product. 

As some reviews state, there is definitely a weird smell to it but even being 7 months pregnant I didn’t think it was that strong, it hardly bothered me and would not keep me from using the product. It is a thicker moisturizer so most likely it will be a cool/cold month product only for me as I can get very oily in the summer. It helped even out my skin tone and hydrates well. It also works well over a serum. I paired it with the volition mushroom water serum and they woke quite nicely together. Just make sure you give your serum time to absorb before you put the moisturizer on top. Overall I am very happy with this product and results. It is a time saver as well."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,,Really nice cream,Very nice thick cream that leaves a slight dewy look. Great for dry skin. Fades marks on your face from acne etc Hardly any smell. Took a star off as its very pricy and not the best I've tried but I like it a lot and would re purchase.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Not worth it,"I was looking for a new night moisturizer with Vitamin C and thought I’d give this a try. Instantly regretted it. I got a mild breakout from using this twice! The smell is unpleasant and reminds me of my sons diaper rash cream/ointment. Lastly, it is way too thick. Would not recommend. Going back to my holy grail, Olehenriksen Vitamin C moisturizer."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Great for sensitive skin,"I have very sensitive skin and am also prone to dryness. My lightweight moisturizer wasn’t cutting it and I went to collect some samples of different choices. The PTR Water Drench made me itch like crazy but did provide good moisturizing results so I tried the Potent-C hoping for the best. I have been using this for 8 months and love it. I’m not itchy, my skin is moist and supple and the container seems to last forever. I feel like my skin looks brighter and more nourished with this product. 

Unlike other reviews, the scent isn’t an issue for me. I don’t smell it once it is absorbed."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Great moisturizing for dry skin.,"I’ve been using this product for 6 mos. and like it.  I use it am/pm, it moisturizes well although I can’t say I’ve experienced much “plumping”.  Moisture lasts until washed off.
Several people mention the smell - which is a lot like Vitamin C serum smells! Although normally sensitive to scents, this product smells natural."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,Seems to work great but I can’t stand the smell.. it’s liked spiced oranges that have gone bad (which I find common amongst vitamin c products).
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,,ms,"Very effective and worth it! My face looks sooo much better just after 1 jar. Will order more and will make it my daily moisturizer.             






"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Almost pungent!,I'm only on day two.... But I'm not sure if I can get over how horrible the scent is!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,Love this. Smells nice and makes my skin plump and smooth.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Really love for my dryyy skin. Unique smell.,"The cream is great for my insanely dry skin. I would not necessarily recommend it for oily skin. I'm in my 30's now and my skin is getting drier, plus winter is coming, and plus I'm using clindamycin alcohol swabs which dry me out like crazy. This is the only cream that can even make a dent in my dryness. Yes, the smell is weird, but I've grown to love it. I think it smells herbal, or like an Indian spice market. Hubby says it smells like BBQ Lays potato chips lol. Anyways, it made me break out on my forehead at first (I think because it's so rich) but after a couple months of using, my skin got used to it and it's been fine. I've been using these products for about 5 months now and my skin feels great. I don't see a dramatic difference as far as anti-aging but I do think it's improved the overall look of my skin at least. The serum is also great because it's super hydrating. Most serums are very thin and soak in within seconds but this one can actually act like a lotion for someone with normal to oily skin."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,,A little bacon-y,"This moisturiser smells like bacon!  And not in a good way, especially as I have to put it on my face.  Very unpleasant.  However, as I paid good money for it, I will use it up, but won’t be buying this again (unless by some miracle the results outweigh the horrible smell..."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,,strong and works,"I use this at night rather than day is it’s quite tacky and takes a while to dry, quite strong and potent in vitamin c it almost works instantly. I saw a fast improvement in texture and pigmentation. "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,"Good moisturizer, makes my skin feel rejuvenated! But the smell is awful (I smell like a bonfire after I put this on) ... other than that, it’s a great product!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,nice cream!,"I received a sample size of this. It’s actually really nice! Super moisturizing, makes my skin supple and soft....it does have an odd smell, like a mix of hot dogs and cinnamon! And it does linger for quite a while. From my experience I’m thinking the hot dog smell is from the ferulic acid. Overall it’s a good cream, I took away a star due to the scent...."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Gross smelling product,It smells bad. Like something burnt. I don't see or feel a difference in my skin. I am so upset I used my beauty points on this sample. The smell of this product also lingers. Ugh going to wash it off right now.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Not Worth It,I have small tiny bumps on my skin as well as redness and this seemed to aggravate it and the smell was also terrible. I tried giving it some time and see if it works but my conclusion is that it’s nowhere near worth its price.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,"Great product, when of the sephora employees recommended it and she was right!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Smells awful,I could not get past how bad it smelled. I had to return it.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,LOVE; Great with my Eczema,"Love this product! I have eczema, so it's difficult to find good moisturizers that not only reduce dryness, but help improve elasticity. It has a thick cream consistency, however, it glides smoothly on skin and doesn't leave oily residues. The morning after the first evening I used this product, my skin was noticeably different! It felt elastic, soft, hydrated, and smooth. Regular use with my evening skincare routine yielded great results. 

The scent is very strong. It is a potent medicinal scent (from the vitamin C), but my nose easily adapted to the smell after 10-15 minutes. It is a very small price to pay for such a wonderful product!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Great product with a milder scent,"For all those who couldnt stand the scent of the Vitamin-C serum from the same brand,this is a good alternative!!! I have seen visible improvements in my uneven skin tone upon regularly using this moisturizer at night .People have also complimented me on my improved skin !!Love this product .I was not put off by the scent which I see was a major issue."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,"I have combination skin with some fine lines and light sun spots and this cream did not work for me. It’s heavy, doesn’t absorb very well into skin and it has a strong smell (I guess from the Ferulic Acid), so I was just not able to use it long enough to see any benefits. Maybe if you have very dry skin and you don’t mind the smell, this could work, but for me it was just a pricey mistake."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,BRIGHT EVEN AND WONDERFUL,"This brand for me is a hit or miss. I can tell you this product is a HUGE HIT. My concern is brightening and texture. Let me say this product not only brightened my hard to get sunspots (which a C serum mostly got rid of) it evened out my skin tone like no other. I have been using this for only a week so far at nights and I see a huge difference. 

Additionally it actually plumped up my skin. I can’t say to the full extent so I use it with the PTR HA serum. When I apply it it doesn’t look like it works if u know what I mean and it smells horrid (smoked food reviews are legit) but when I wake up my skin is bright even and fresh. This product is a must get especially if your looking for powerful C as this is one of the most potent C products out there and I have tried so many. 
And regarding the scent it’s totally worth it and it’s not too bad."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Not worth the price.,I used this faithfully for 3 months. I saw no difference in my skin at all. So disappointed.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Yerg,"I got a sample of this and it turned my skin into a mass of tiny red bumps! My skin feels rough and scaly, plus this stuff smells like beef jerky that’s been left in a car. In the desert. For a week.

Just don’t buy this, it’s the literal worst."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,Broke me out really bad : (
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,"I’ve tried many moisturizers and treatments for my redness, and so far, this one is tops. It’s extremely moisturizing and also leaves a warming sensation on your face (very subtle) that seems to give it some plumpness and dewiness. I’ve seen some reviews saying, “I don’t like the smell.” The smell isn’t the greatest, no, but if you want products that work WELL, scent should be at the bottom of your considerations. Highly recommend for those with dryness, redness, and skin that needs a bit of a wake-up."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,,quality product,"l first purchased this cream , looking for a quality skin care range suitable for  aging skin and tired complexion. This cream is amazing. My skin feels hydrated, glowing and the texture has improved so much. l highly recommend this cream after trying many other brands. lt has  a slight medicated scent, but is brilliant under makeup as well.  Well worth the money. l will be purchasing more Peter Roth products as my permanent skin care. "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Potent-C Bright & Plump Moisturizer,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Potent-C Bright &amp; Plump Moisturizer - 50ml,"I like the way my skin feels after using this. It’s very thick & rich so a little goes a long way. I will say tho, the “unscented” scent that it is supposed to have is absolutely TERRIBLE!!! Why just why?!! This would be so much better with a nicer smell. It’s really overwhelming. I probably will not repurchase because of the darn terrible rotten smell"
CHARLOTTE TILBURY-Magic Night Cream Refill,Singapore,Good,This is a repeat purchase since it is cheaper to get the refill. I like that it is hydrating for dry skin. Some people may not like cos because it is thicker than most moisturizer. 
GIVENCHY-Ressource Rich Moisturizing Face Cream,Malaysia,Rich Cream for the Rich,"You're paying a lot for 50ML. 
The cream is rich and very buttery, so a little bit is enough to cover the whole face (and neck). It is moisturising but other than that there's nothing much going on. 

This moisturiser is scented and fragranced skincare is really not a good thing, unless you like scented products. Smells fresh, but reminds me of some generic green-tea scented products. 

Unless it's on sale, this one is really not worth getting. Better products are available. "
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Singapore,midnight secret not midnight miracle,good texture great effect with antioxidants. but still this is not a miracle. go to bed before midnight. midnight secret won't save you. only sleep can.
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Singapore,Smells Good,"Product smells good and definitely for your night time skincare, its more of a feel good product for me as i didn't really notice any changes to my skin. "
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Singapore,Repeated Purchase,"one of my favourite skincare products. It has been used up 5 or 6 tubes , it always works well when I sleep late. Highly recommended especially for ladies that need to stay late before going to bed."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Australia,Lin,Great product! I will keep buying it. 
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,smells like heaven,"I have always loved guerlain and I went on a pricey limb trying this and it delivers, smells amazing and is a total life saver gamechanger"
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Australia,Refreshed,Good overnight mask for a facial reset. Good to use after a big night out and wake up looking refreshed. The only downside was the price.
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Singapore,nice smell,"Nice smell and not harsh to my skin. However i do not really know does it makes a difference to my face. But can feel that maybe the next day, my face is a bit more smooth. Certainly love the smell though, however it is too expensive."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Australia,Tiny tube that can calm down my skin,"I only put this cream on my face when i have tired skin and break out, the next day morning can see my skin getting better. This tube is a bit tiny for this price."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Singapore,What’s the secret? ,"This is my 2nd tube. 1st tube worked well n I could sort of see the effect the next day, that’s why I bought it a second time. But this time round, didnt see any effect. "
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Singapore,Does not do wonders,It’s a lightweight cream that’s supposed to be applied as a late night recovery treatment. I applied for few months but didnt notice any significant results. 
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Australia,GUERLAIN midnight serum,There have been very mixed reviews about this product. I do find though that GUERLAIN products do what they've promised to do & this is no different. The only negative id give it is that the tube is way too small....other than that - highly recommended!!
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Australia,Visible effect,"Overnight treatment is definitely my go-to instant skin fix that fits well with my lifestyle, so I’ve been trialing a lot of them over the past year. The cult-fav Guerlain Midnight Secret is my absolute favorite – I can’t believe I’ve only just discovered this little gem! It has always been the ‘secret product’ for the celebs and beauty insiders as it claims to give you an ‘8-hour well rested radiant complexion’ that makes up for the lack of sleep, so the mask is infamously known as ‘an overnight treatment that smooths away any signs of fatigue for short nights!’
I love the effect when I rinse it off the next morning – my complexion appears noticeably brightened, revitalized with an amazing glow."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Australia,it’s ok,"Smells nice but doesn’t work wonder to me. I don’t think the product is worth the hype and the design makes it hard to get the very last bit out of the tube. Also, had breakout after using it constantly for 2 nights."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,My dry skin loves it,"The product is smaller than the picture shows. My skin type is combination to very dry, especially during change of season. I would apply it ~1-2 times a week at night, and it has surprisingly lasted me a couple of months. The consistency of this product is more of lotion than serum, and it is scented (I don’t mind it too much). 
I would repurchase this item."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,Old school was a better school,Wearing a sad face because I first tried this when it didn't come in plastic and didnt look like a generous sample. It used to do wonders for the day after partying. I bought it expecting that same efficacy. I was disappointed that this upscale luxury brand bought into the cheap is better policy and put it  in a plastic tube but at luxury prices. It did nothing for me. I wasn't particularly tired. I did expect  to look even more rested. Nope. Nada. Zip nothing. It made my foundation go on smoother as a moisturizing primer but I have plenty of things to do that. I won't buy again.
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Canada,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,a good product that makes you look better and minimize pores.
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Singapore,overnight mask ,I expected to see a big difference by applying the mask. But it is not moisturizing enough and does not give any wow effect to me the next morning. Quite a disappointing buy. Maybe I put a high expectation on guerlain product. 
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,"Rescue serum ! 
    
        I read all the reviews on this product on here and outside of Sephora before purchasing, lots of mixed reviews but I decided to go ahead and try it anyway , boy! I’m glad I did !!! I’m in my early 30’s so signs of aging are starting to creep up on me , most noticeable with little sleep or an especially stressful day . That being said this little tube is a life saver ! I notice the serum (more of a lotion) working in a couple of hours or so and yes skin looks more youthful in the AM , I also want to note that I have this stubborn little line forming on my forehead and after this serum it almost disappears and stays plump for a few days ! I will agree that the tube is rather small with a hefty price tag but seeing the results I will definitely repurchase anyway . Tip : exfoliating really well before applying this serum is when you really see results ,hope this helps :)"
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Canada,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,Face is plump and look so refreshed and hydrated the next morning.
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Australia,love this!,"Absolutely love this product. I can really notice the difference the next morning when putting it on before bed, as my skin looks fresh and hydrated. Small tube but a little goes a long way. Thoroughly recommend."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Singapore, din quite work for me,Doesn't look any difference for me after one night.. And i had a full night sleep. Perhaps need to try when I dun have any sleep. its expensive for a small bottle. Will not repurchase
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Malaysia,soso,"It is advertised to contain compound essence, which extracts the power of seaweed to brighten the skin, and wakes up the next day with vitality and radiance, smooth and bright. Commonly known as ""night stay frost"". But I don't really like its taste. It's a little too greasy when I just applied it."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Canada,Night Owl Rescue,"amazing results.  I was staying up late to have some me time.  been sleeping at 2 or 3 am.  gosh I put this on before bed.  next morning or I should say afternoon,  I noticed I was glowing.  skin got better."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Canada,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,"This product works great for the first time, then just became a disappointment. It meant for use once or twice a week and I did just that. I'm not sure why, but I started to show sensitivity and have tingling sensations."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,This product is so disappointing! My face breaks out because of it.
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,Absolutely love.  Felt the difference right away. My skin was glowing the next day and kept the hydration all night. My only complaint is that it needs to be sold in larger bottle. Love a must!
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,secret,i have dry skin and note that a friend noted that my skin looked less dry (after i used this). This might be what made my skin less dry since i did not change my skincare routine.
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,love it,"I love this mask.*Midnight Secret*.  It is a bit pricey but I love how it doesn’t leave my skin oily or heavy. I wear it overnight and the next morning after I wash my face my skin feels firm yet soft and hydrated. The scent is subtle yet it may not be for everyone.
"
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,must have night time cream,"Cost effective product and it does a good job of keeping skin hydrated. It won’t bother acne skin, at least I didn’t have any reaction when I am using this night time cream."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Canada,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,I don’t see what the hype is all about. The cream does nothing and smells strongly of perfume.
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,good,I brought two during 15% off. And I have been using it for a period of time. The effect is very good.  But cannot use everyday. So although it is small and use for quite long
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,product not sealed ,the product came with no seal of any kind. this makes me a bit uncomfortable as the lotion has spilled a bit. it is scented. I've applied a bit on the back of my hand and it feels quite good and soft.
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,A must-have magic treatment when you have to stay up late.
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,High rated is not always good,"I can’t see any benefits after I first use this product, and it made me have 4,5 breakouts the other morning. I am 26 combine&dry skin. I expected a lot because it was so popular and high rated, but it really wasn’t that good to me. I rather buy another La prairie sleeping mask. It is a little pricey but at least it dose the job."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,that expensive cream,"this is a good moisturizing cream. when I have a really bad dry skin around my chin, I'd put this on and it doesnt sting. the scent is quite strong though, would be great if it was milder. what a small tube of cream and the price tag is very high!"
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,love it ,"It’s really help during my night shift period. Normally I will have outbreak after my night shift. But after use this, my skin more stable and look radiance the next day. "
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Canada,One of the Many Secret Weapons a Girl Should Have.,"This product does exactly what it says it does.  I have used it numerous times and thank my lucky stars that I found it.  Two hours of sleep, no problem.  This product definitely helps with recovery.  Makes you skin feel like silk and it smells great too.  

I understand where other reviewers expected a larger tube, however, this is not suppose to be an everyday product (though you could if you wanted I'm sure).  This is one of those emergency products that everyone should have in their back pocket.  I always have some on hand!"
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,The smell !!!,"I love this product a lot, especially the smell, but I wish they have bigger size of the cream ."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,Sleep Hard to Come By... Try This!!,I have a newborn and sleep is hard to come by these days which does nothing good for my skin! Using this mask has really helped my skin become less stressed and look less tired!! For the price point it was totally worth it!! You will thank yourself later!
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,Second purchase!,"I have used up one tube and it works really well. I'm a full-time engineering student and staying up all night is probably like my weekly routine. Whenever I feel dull and dehydrated on my skin, I just apply a layer of this onto my face and I could rise with a healthy glow on my face. Even though this does no good to my dark circles, still it balances oil and water when my skin is dehydrated during awaken nights."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,amazing! ,"What can I say!!! The best product ever! It’s perfect for that wild night but you look like full rested for 8hours the next day! I wish I knew about this during university days too, when I used to study all night, and won’t show my exhausting read, makes you look like a natural genius!"
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,great product but its no longer in sephora💔,"the one of the best moisturizer in my life for 27 years old. its efficient effect for continuous apply for first three days follow by once or twice in a week after the skin in good condition to maintain our face. the lavender scent is the natural smell. the smell so good for me,overall i love this! but the worse thing is the awesome product was quit from sephora :("
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,Canada,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,Loved this cream.  Yeah its small but you don't need a lot. Works well and smells so good!
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,nice,"I ado re this product. It makes me feel very pampered, moisturised and ladylike. I have no idea if there are any real benefits to using the product- to be honest I can't really see any difference. But it does make my skin feel soft and dewy- like when I was 20 :) "
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,overprice,"Normal skin maybe a yes. But for dry skin, i feel the hydration and glowy effect not that obvious, might rather buy a good night cream . As the size is kinda small for this and not super impressed for me. "
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,Ms,"Generally speaking it’s a good skin care product, feeling the deep repair after wearing my makeup for a super long time. A little bit cool feeling and friendly to my dry skin but some of my oily skin friends said it’s overwhelming for them. A little bit expensive, but it’s worthy!"
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,Magic!,"I use this a little differently. I use it every night before going to bed, after cleaning my face. Weirdly, it solves my acne problem and my facial skin just loves it."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,nice ,"always best seller but small .hard to buy,easy to use and good result next day,good for all kinds of skin ,you must be have one ,just buy it ,donot wait it ,"
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,Over hyped,"It suppose to act like some emergency cream to help with tired looks or when you stayed up late for the night and still wanna look ok the next morning, but nahhhh, it's just a normal moisturizer that hydrate your skin but that's it, and if you use it continuously, you'll have breakouts.

So using once or twice a week did nothing, using few days in a row gives me breakouts. I am really speechless with this product"
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,feels good but its not that amazing ,"I've heard alot of good things about this product so I couldn't help but ordered it to try. I used it once a week as recommended, basically this replaces your face cream and the next day after using it my face feels smoother and softer and it's recommended to use on night when you have to stay up late. but besides feeling smooth and softer there really isn't anything amazing. so I'll only recommend you to buy if you often have to burn the midnight oil. besides that other face cream will do the job as well. as this is really pricey for the sheer 15ml in size. "
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,love it ,"Strongly recommend!! I really love this product!!! Only use 2-3 times a week, it gave my skin a glow after I apply it . But it will be  slightly oily for ppl who have oily skin "
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,Disappointed,"I read many glowing reviews for this night cream, so I was really shocked when I tried it and it didn’t do anything for me. I didn’t care for the smell, and I just didn’t like how it felt on my face. You know how sometimes you’ll put a product on your face and you feel like “ew this feels cheap, I wish I didn’t just put this on my face”.. that’s how I felt about this one. I can’t understand what others liked about this product."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,It's just fair,"It's fair?! i am not sure. Pricy? Nope, but the amount is small, so it seems like not cheap if you calculate by per oz. About the effect, I have almost finished one of three, nothing change I believe so far; however, nothing bad at the moment."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,"First time I heard about this is from some Asian beauty bloggers and it's hard to imaging how popular this is in Asia. Since the price tag is great I bought four of these during sale event. It states in Guerlain's website that it could NOT be used every night, max three times per week, so even it's only half ounce per tube it will still last me a long time. So far I used about six times, as l stay up late all the time I could not say it magically fixed my night owl look, but I did wake up with a bit well rested glow (just not last long...). I guess this would be great for someone that go to bed early regularly and use it for ""first aid"" on random stay up late nights."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,Don't believe the hype,I know this is not an every day use type of cream but I definitely did not see the results they hype up. The smell is nice but for the size I would not repurchase.
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,"First of all, yes it is small for the price. Is it worth it?  Absolutely!!  It’s not meant to be used everyday. When I do, I notice a significant difference in my skin. Friends and family have too. If you’re in the fence about it, I’d say give it a try. You’ll be glad you did"
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,Great product,I got it because a Chinese movie star was talking about this product :) it is indeed a great product !!! It is a bit heavy so you don’t use it everyday I only use it when I know I am gonna stay awake all night long (I have a new born daughter ) the next morning my skin looks bright and glowing !!!
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,This is a sample sized product. I liked the silly texture and the loved that it moisturized my skin but that’s about it.
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,Almost free for what it does.,For those of you who complain that the size of it is tiny - it is NOT meant to be used every night. It's an express help for the days when you went to bed very late. Look at Guerlain's price tag for the skincare - this product is a STEAL. Works just amazing.
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,pleasant smell and comfort cream,"Fragrant cream with the signature smell of Guerlain. The cream has enriched texture and good moisturizing effect. However, it is quite over advertised and pricey. Maybe worth trying is available on Sephora sales?"
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,"I use this anytime I know I may not be getting much sleep or if I want to look particularly nice the next day. I don't know what type of voodoo magic this cream holds, but I always feel that I look fresh when I wake up! It is a bit pricey but defintiely worth it!"
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,Just amazing,"I have no idea why they make this in deluxe sample size, I'd buy in bulk if I could. It is that amazing."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,Magical product! Must try if u have to stay up late sometimes.
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,LOVE,Saw a difference in my skin the very first time I used it and it smells so nice.  Stop reading reviews and just buy it.
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,best night mask ever,"Package looks so cheap and small but Leaves skin looking super hydrated and soft. When you travel skip the serum, moisturizer and eye cream. Just bring this with you. (Guerlain Please make bigger size..)"
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,Thein,"Leaves my skin soft but a bit dry. And my face look puffy/plumped. I don’t like puffy/plumped. I like tightened and firmed. So Midnight secret is not for me. It has a very nice smell though.  Although it Comes Very small tube, only need to used very few per application. So can use many times for those who like plumped effect. "
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,"I've used this three times now and I love it.  Once i applied it at night knowing that i wasn't going to get more than 3 hours sleep, and then again after my shower in the morning, the other two times I've managed it only in the morning, but either way it perks my skin up so much, and allows it to be smooth and hydrated for a light touch of foundation.  Yes it seems a little pricy,  but to be honest, I was considering La Mer soft cream as an alternate, which is nearly 3x the price for the same number of grams in a less sanitary container.  I will continue to buy this for important days and gift it to friends."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,!!!,"This does exactly what it claims to do (especially if I pair it with Sunday Riley's Tidal), have gone into work with 20 minutes sleep and looked amazing. #1 product for those on the brink of a nervous breakdown, no one will know you're an absolute disaster inside."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,"As someone who tends to pull a lot of late night works and all-nighters, this is awesome to put on before a nap or just a few hours of sleep. It doesn't solve all the problems, but it does even out my skin tones and soothes some blemishes."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,the secret is... there is no secret!,"Unfortunately this product did not work for me. I'm 38 with combo/oily skin, & it made me breakout. I liked the smell & silk texture, but I feel it never absorbed completely into my skin. The 5 nights I used it, I didn't notice any benefits that next morning... but I did notice greasy skin & clogged pores ;("
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,Ms,"There is no down side for me. The fragrance is nice (typical Guerlain scent), it is moisturizing without feeling oily, and best of all, I feel that my face is less puffy the next morning. I wish it can come with a 50ml packaging."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,,great cream at night,"First i love the smell. It reminds me of flower and past loves. The cream is soft on my skin. No oiliness was observed while applying. Upon waking up and as expected, you wake up refreshed and your face non sticky as if a good night sleep potion just worked on you. "
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,Amazing,"After a long day of crying and traveling, I applied this with just a moisturizer on top right before bed. I was surprised to wake up to glowing skin. This stuff is amazing. The package is small but I will only use when I need a boost in my skincare."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,Excellence with a price,Using this product sporadically when I need extra help with moisture. It works splendidly but the price per unit is a boogey man! AHHH! Slight consideration for repurchase. A must try!
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,"Purchased this based upon the great reviews. Since I've been sick with a nasty cold, my skin looks wretched. Had to go to work so I used some of this cream at bedtime as a way to pamper my skin. Woke up to glowing skin that was smooth and soft. My makeup went on easily and my skin looked smooth and refreshed. Still felt lousy but my skin looked good. It's expensive but it's a must have on-hand for those times when skin needs a little pampering."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,Very pleased,I use this in the evenings on my skin before bed and in the morning my skin looks rested. The scent is intoxicating and it leaves your skin hydrated and rested and not puffy. I'm very pleased with my purchase. I just wish the tube was double the size. It's pretty small.
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,GUERLAIN Midnight Secret 15ml,"This. Is. The. BOMB.!!!
I put it on before bed when i was about to have like 4 hours of sleep and woke up expecting to look horrible, but this stuff made my skin look glowy and healthy and feel smooth as a baby's bum. Would recommend!"
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,it's ok,Smells good but not sure if it's worth the money. I bought it because the reviews were so good but I didn't find it life changing.
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,Too small,"I bought it online and my surprise when I receive it was the size! It looks like a luxury sample... Because of the reviews, I assume that it is very good, so I bought it, and I agree with them now, but sadly I think that it will last very little..."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,What dreams are made of!,"I purchased this on a whim in line to check out  at Sephora, and this stuff is INCREDIBLE. The price tag made me a little sad, but the product in side was the moisturizer that dreams are made of. My skin has never felt softer, smoother, and looked more glowy then when I used this product. It smells incredible, and it really, truly, genuinely works. I used it all over my face, including my lips, and on my neck. If I were rich, I'd by this stuff by the boatload."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,So torn....,"I used this last night, Thursday, after 3 hectic, sleepless days & then having spent all day at the dentist with some complications. So I figured with all the ""makes you look non-zombie"" reviews, it was the perfect time to swap this into my routine- PTR Rose Stem Face Wash, PTR 24K Toner, Sunday Riley Luna, Korres Wild Crocus - Saffron D'Or serum, Perricone Pre-Empt Brightening Eye Cream, and then added my usual 3 drops of Drunk Elephant Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil to the Guerlain to make it a treatment/moisturizer. 

I woke up this morning looking like I had slept for a week!! My skin looked absolutely incredible. But.... it felt more dry than ever.  Usually I can use the Drunk Elephant by itself otherwise I mix it with Fresh Rose Deep Hydration Cream on super yucky days.  It seemed, however that the Guerlain cancelled out the marula oil.

So I guess for now, it's an emergency-only bottle on my vanity.  The complete facial overhaul definitely makes it worth the price since you only need a teensy bit. I'll just have to hydrate a little more on the mornings after I absolutely have to use it."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,amazing!,"I went to bed late knowing I wouldn't get more than a few hours sleep, woke up, looked like I had slept 8 hours. Tempted to use it everyday, will repurchase for sure! Scent really isn't overpowering"
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,Better than holy grail!,"This treatment is superb for tired, stressed skin.  I use it on rough nights and as a moisturizer on mornings when I haven't had enough sleep. This light cream has a notable fragrance (which I don't mind, iI actually enjoy it.) This treatment truly makes you look more rested without any uncomfortable feeling of tightened skin. Some of these radiance treatments firm the skin but don't actually make the skin look healthier and well-rested - this stuff does (note that I also bring it up under the eye area.) It really does transform my skin and it makes my foundation lie beautifully. My skin tone looks improved and I just look like I've had 8 hours of sleep   I don't use it every night or every morning but it is always in my arsenal.  I've used it for years and will NEVER be without it. For reference, I'm 51 with fair,  normal to dry skin."
GUERLAIN-Midnight Secret 15ml,USA,omg holy holy grail,Amazing! Miracle cream made from the diamond tips of Unicorns... Smells amazing! Soaks into the skin with no greasy feeling. Hydrates and makes your skin look incredible. Perfect SOS cream for dehydrated or just help me skin. Seriously one of the best I have tried. It does have a strong smell but so does all Guerlain. Worth the buy! Especially for$29
INNISFREE-Jeju Orchid Enriched Cream,Singapore,pretty good,the product smells really good! it's pretty thick so I usually just put a thin layer and when my skin needs that extra moisture. able to put in the AM and PM.
INNISFREE-Jeju Orchid Enriched Cream,Australia,d,Really pretty the colour of it
INNISFREE-Jeju Orchid Enriched Cream,New Zealand,maybe for really dry skin,"This product is really, um, sticky.  It has a super odd texture, kind of like greasy honey.  Once it’s rubbed in it kind of comes right but I literally have to rub it into my hands really well or it’s a sticky mess on my face.  Maybe for super dry skin for an occlusive type night cream, but hard pass from me"
WEI-Five Sacred Grains Rapid Glow Liquid Milk Moisturiser,,great toner,it really smell great!!! n easy absorb to skin . skin bcome smooth n healthy. i feel my skin hydrate and glow. i always change my toner n this is my fav toner ever. really recommend for those want smooth and glow skin
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Singapore,good for makeup prep,Accidentally took and bought this instead of the day emulsion but this works for makeup prep for my dry skin as well. Not so effective for my dry skin at night tho. Might have to reapply at night but this is marketed for oily skin anyway. 
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It has a faint floral small.  Left the skin feeling smooth, soft, and hydrated.  It is lightweight and do not need to apply much at nighttime.  It is a bit pricy."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Great overnight skincare,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Definitely a high quality product. Nice that is it only lightly scented. For the price point I expected  a little more from this, but overall I am happy with the results from using it at night. I work up with refreshed skin."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This nighttime moisturizer feels lightweight and it does make your skin feel super soft. It has a very faint scent but I didn’t notice a big difference.  My face did look moisturized and fresh but didn’t take away any signs of aging. It is very expensive but maybe more use would make a difference.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Got this as a sample via Influenster - for the price point I don’t think it's much different from any other emulsion.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Lightly Fragranced & Light Weight,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a great light weight and lightly fragranced moisturizer. It left my skin feeling smooth and 
and refreshed each morning. A little bit goes a long way."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This was a great product. I used it nightly for a week and I woke up with my skin feeling refreshed each morning. It was light weight and provided a lot of coverage with only a small amount. The fragrance is light and not overpowering.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,A night time moisturizer,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is actually a lightweight night moisturizer that emphasizes in the prevention of appearance of dark spots. I'm all about that because I suffer from pigmentation. I can't tell much for such claim because I only have tried the 12ml version of this emulsion but it definitely felt nice and hydrating. Apparently this is one of the bestseller items from the brand hence the hefty price tag. I might give this a try for the 30ml bottle in the future after I finish my current vitamin C product.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Obsessed!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Loved this product on my sensitive skin. It has a lightweight luxurious feel and felt very hydrating for my dry skin. Love it!!
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Good,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This fortifying emulsion left my skin silky smooth and feeling luxurious like in the description.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Good but nothing special,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This fortifying emulsion left my skin silky smooth and feeling luxurious like in the description. Certain products make me break out and this one treated my skin like a baby’s bum. I don’t necessarily recommend it because I don’t think it’s a necessary addition to my beauty routine and after looking at the price, there are other products out there that are better and less expensive. Overall it’s a good product but I wouldn’t personally purchase it."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Lightweight hydration,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a good overall lotion for summer since it is lightweight. However I do not believe it will be enough for dry winters. It did leave a nice feeling on the skin and not much product was needed since it is more on the liquid side.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This feels luxurious on the skin. I like how there’s no scent and it did not irritate my sensitive skin. My skin feels instantly hydrated. It feels light weight and not tacky. However, I’m not sure the hydration is enough for the dryer months."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Dark spots be gone,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really appreciate the ingredients and I have a few dark spots that I want to take care of while I’m still in my 30s. This makes the experience more pleasurable because I can feel the luxe in the consistency of the formula between my fingers. It does not feel like a heavy mask. Over time I should see more long term results but for the few weeks I have noticed that there are less prominent dark spots. The price is a little more than I would typically invest in this product but if I was feeling like treating myself it is a good gift.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I think it’s a good product to hydrate and moisturize your skin in the summer, but not enough in the winter. My skin is always really dry especially during the weather change, and I felt that this is not good enough during these times!"
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Lightweight hydration!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I was very surprised at this product. It’s super lightweight and feels amazing on the skin. It doesn’t have a strong scent and not sticky at all. My sensitive skin liked it and felt hydrated after. I like that you can use it just before bed and wake up feeling hydrated. I highly recommended this.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I got a sample size from influenster to test out, I love this product! very light toner, there is no irritations and is good for my skin type,  been using for 2 weeks and my skin feel soft right away when i use it. But I think is not moisturize e enought for winter time"
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Hydrating night serum,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Waking up with hydrated skin feels amazing and isn't common in winter so I'm glad it's working! If you have dry skin, try this out!"
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Full disclosure, I need clear steps when given multiple products for a “facial routine”. Once I figured out this didn’t need to be used in sequence with all the other samples I fell in love. I use it before bed as my night time moisturizer and love that it is lightweight and yet hydrating. With a very subtle scent it doesn’t irritate my skin. I really do like this product and would totally use it regularly, unfortunately the price is a bit much thus not giving it 5 stars."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Great product and feels good on skin. I use this instead of toner.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It’s moisturizing, light and not oily. It makes your skin feel soft, smooth and rejuvenated. I would recommend this to everyone."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Love,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I think this is my most favourite sample product from Cle de Peau! It is absolutely light, moisturizing and not oily. It made my skin feel so soft and super hydrated."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Amazingly great for dry skin!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I cannot believe how much I loved this. I've been trying to find a product that will hydrate my dry skin, but also continue to make it feel hydrated without feeling like I am lathering my face with lotion. This is it! It was nice and airy and it went lightly onto my face. I don't feel like it was super oily. The only thing that deters me is high price point. I usually buy lancome and it is also a pricey brand, and I really liked this product and was looking to switch over, but the price point deterred me. If you're able to afford this luxury product, it is hands down one of my favourite samples I've gotten for dry skin."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) OH SNAP! This is what my combination skin has been looking for. It’s hydrating for my dry spots and not oily for oily spots. Only gave it a 4 star though cuz it’s pricey. If money is not a problem…then it’s a must try.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Packs a punch of hydration & oily skin friendly,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) At first when I noticed how thin & runny the formula was I was sceptical that it was going to feel nourishing/moisturizing. But I was wrong, it absorbs into the skin perfectly & left my skin looking plumped, glowy & hydrated. It is lightly scented (it smells luxurious & not too overpowering) & a little goes a long way. It did not make my skin more oily (which is common for moisturizers on my skin) My face feels soft & hydrated after a week of using this exclusively with a few other cle de peau products in this line."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Left my skin feeling fresh and hydrated. Glad to have gotten to try this product
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Amazing!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product is such a treat for the skin , my skin os a combination and it provides enough hydration without feeling greasy or tacky. I was looking for something to decrease my fine lines and this is doing an amazing job of combating that. Highly recommended."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I liked this product a lot. It made my face feeling fresh and hydrated. It is a luxury brand so this product is pricey
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Rich and moisturizing,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) A very rich and moisturizing lotion. Great for bedtime treatment so it has time to absorb into the skin.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product is beautiful, would work nicely as a moisturizer for sure ! The only reason not for 5 stars is the price point and the fragrance."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Moisturizing and light,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love this as it is light and not oily.  My skin feels hydrated after applying.  Nice light smell as well.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Light and Silky,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a light and silky moisturizer with a gentle floral scent.  I really enjoy using this.  The packaging is gorgeous, the scent is jot too strong, and it feels lovely going on.  I have fairly dry skin, however, and this isn't moisturizing enough for me, especially in the winter.  I can see this being really great, though, if you have more oily or combination skin.  It's quite expensive, but if you have the budget, it's a nice splurge."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have used this product originally over five years ago and have tried it again as of recent. Still as great as ever and is not heavy for a night cream so it's suitable for all seasons. Though recommended to use with the cle de peau cotton pads, I don't feel there is a need to as it absorbs well enough by itself."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Really enjoyed this,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This was such a lightweight and hydrating step after using The Serum! It layers on so well with other products and sunk right into my skin! Instant plump and smoothness! I really enjoyed using this. It didn’t have a scent to it like other CDP products too so that was a plus. I’ll keep using it to see if the results get better or keeps up:)
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Great product,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really liked this product.It is very light weight.It’s smell is very refreshing.It provides deep hydration.Thank you Influenster for sending me this freebie.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Lightweight and hydrating,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I liked how lightweight this night cream is. I feel like I wake up to softer, smoother skin and I love that feeling"
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,a light night cream,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It is a very light weight night-cream and it suited me well as I have extremely oily skin. It has a very mild fragrance but it did not bother me. It did not break me out and left my skin well hydrated for the night. I was unable to use it for a very long time to notice any long term benefits as I received a small size. #TheEmpowerOfThree #complimentary @Influenster
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really enjoyed this product. It felt luxurious and was silky and smooth. I felt instant hydration and the scent was non existent, which I appreciate."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I do agree that this is very lightweight but it didn’t seem to hydrate my skin at all. My skin felt tight afterwards and I kept forgetting that I had done my skincare routine because it felt off. I have combination skin and rosacea and it’s just not working for me. The smell was also too much and not very pleasant. For the price of this one I would try just about anything else instead.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Light moisturizer,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a very light weight night cream that works to hydrate my combination / tending towards oily skin. I received a small sample from Influenster so I could only use it for under a week but so far it doesn't wow me.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It absorbs so quickly into my skin and definitely leaves it feeling hydrating! Makes it look very fresh and awake
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,recommended,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a light-weight emulsion that absorbs quickly into my skin easily. Received from influencer to try out and I love how my skin turns out after using it!! would highly recommend it to my friends and family.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Hydrating and absorbs well,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) A great light cream with a pleasant scent. It made my skin look and feel more hydrated and healthy. I used it with the serum and hydro clarifying lotion and it did wonders for my skin.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Lightweight moisturizer for combo skin,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love this moisturizer! It works so well for my combo skin. My skin has been extremely dry because of harsh winter weather (too many -40 days this winter!) and this has brought my skin back to life while not triggering an oil freak out on my nose. It even works well under my eyes.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Love this moisturizer!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is my new favourite moisturizer! I’ve been struggling with dry patches on my cheeks and this moisturizer helped alleviate that. It’s light but very hydrating (without feeling heavy). It also smells very luxurious- just like a spa!
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Lightweight moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I expected this product to be more moisturizing but for the winter I definitely had to add a night cream on top of this. If you’re looking for a product to moisturize or hydrate, this emulsion wouldn’t be enough. The texture is great, it’s not greasy or sticky and absorbs well into the face. It’s supposed to increase skin firmness but i’m not too sure if I saw any effects after using it for a week."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Great product! It has thin consistency, and it’s a light weight lotion. Absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling smooth and hydrated. I have combination to dry skin. This would be great to use in summer when the climate is more humid. For winter I can see myself using it as an extra layer of moisturizer before applying other creams."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,A drink for my skin,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) A drink for my skin. So nice. Not greasy. Suitable for sensitive combination skin. Glides in nicely with no residue. Silky smooth. Left my skin feeling great.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Light yet effective,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this deluxe product as a free sample, and just love it!

The Emulsion is light, it goes on like a light cream yet still very effective and moisturizing. It is gentle enough to use on my dry skin. You only need to apply a thin layer over the face and go to sleep. And you’ll see your face super soft and plumped as well as shiny in the next day morning. It smells really decent not over-powering though. I’d say this emulsion is the best value. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants luxurious experience to put it on everyday."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It’s very hydrating yet lightweight. As someone with combo/oily skin, this is the perfect moisturizer alternative for me especially in the summer."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a super light weight product that helped my skin appear more hydrated and was softer to the touch. My skin feels better and better each time I use it. I look forward to seeing the long term results. It has a light, very clean scent to it that is enjoyable but not overwhelming at all."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) A light lotion that absorbs easily without sticky residue. Suitable for oily to normal skin.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Emulsion,Singapore,love it ,Excellent quality. Always a fan of Clea de peau. I am so glad Sephora now included this brand. The texture for this night emulsion is thinner than the day emulsion. 
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,Singapore,Favourite moisturiser,"I have been using this for ages, light weight and fragrance-less. Suitable for day time and layering with SPF. I used this for night time as well and pair it up with the face oil."
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,USA,Bobbi Brown Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,I did not like how it’s smells. Way overpriced for product quality.
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,Malaysia,not for my oily skin,"I bought because of the rave reviews saying that it suits oily skin. Nahhhhhh a big NO Love the jar though, very classy and high-end. The rest of it, nothing impresses me"
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,Malaysia,The Best ,"Been using this for a while now. It keeps my skin hydrated and works well as a base before my makeup. Since I have an oily acne prone skin, I have to make sure my skin is well hydrated before I apply my products. By far the best moisturiser and I’ve been using bobbi past 10 years with no issues.. will definitely recommend this product !!!"
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,Malaysia,Good moisturizer,"It's a good moisturizer, though I can't see difference on my skin.. but it doesn't cause my skin to breakout, that's good enough. I have sensitive skin and finding products that can go well with my skin is not easy. But I like the Vitamin Enriched more (I really really love the sample of it, but the full-sized product is not as good.. but still I like it more than this Hydrating Water Fresh Cream)"
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,Malaysia,not much of a diff so far,"Used it for a week, not much of a diff. Maybe need more time.                                                                                                               "
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,Malaysia,It is really Hydrating!!,I saw the result immediatly after first time using. even it last on skin next day. It makes my skin brighter and a bit more white. the only thing is acne. Im not sure they are because of this product or other factors. any way it may cause acne for oily faces like me.
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,USA,Bobbi Brown Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,I like the face base better I know this isn’t the same at all.  It’s light weight.
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,Malaysia,For that perfect makeup base ,"For that perfect makeup base, get this moisturiser! You don’t need any primer (if you don’t have any skin concerns). But if you have oily or acne prone skin, this is not something you can wear on a daily basis because it can clog your pores"
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,USA,I love this!,"My face feels so soft and moisturized. I was worried because I have combination skin , but this has proven to be great with just a few days of using the product. Highly recommended!"

"
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,Malaysia,expensive but good,The product is good but definitely expensive. It does feel kinda sticky and heavy on the face when the day is hot. Feels more of a night time moisturiser compared to a day time one. It does leave your face feeling all plump and hydrated

BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,Malaysia,Madam,"Amazing! I always face dehydration on my combination type of skin. And after reading all the great reviews given to this product, I made myself to have a try. Feels so nervous at first, cause almost all of my moisturiser that I’ve been using in the past 5 years has given me so much experience, worse is always feels burning on my skin although they are USA brand skin care - which people always hyped about. 

So yeah I said, why not??
After 5 years, I should have tried something else already and here am I!
Super in love with such a great moisturiser manufactured by Bobby Brown.
It leaves my skin hydrated alwaysssss (which I love so much!) and amazingly pimples getting-off as well!

See! Hydration is the key and yes! This moisturiser is a YES!❤️

Xoxo! Tyra Yusoff from 🇲🇾"
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,Malaysia,awesome,"love it!! smooth and hydrate my skin. I don't need primer to apply foundation,it blend smoothly. I've been using around a week, it doesn't breakout my skin, so yeah!! definitely will purchase again"

BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,USA,Hydrates and doesn't me break out,"It's so hard to find a moisturizer without silicones, especially one that hydrates.

BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,USA,Not for oily skin,"My skin does feel hydrated and I love that is light and cooling, however my skin is soooo shiny and oily still. It also leaves my face feeling sticky."
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,Canada,no!,"No no no!
The texture is very thick, it doesn’t melt that great between fingers. When I applied it on my face it left a very bad sticky feeling. The cream did not get full absorbed into the skin, it left a layer of not healthy shine on my face. I live BB products and I was looking to buying this cream. I really hope it works for other skin types."
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,USA,Very hydrating lightweight moisturizer,I’m so glad they released this recently. It’s amazing how this one works and how it hydrates my skin  so well without silicons or oils. I have dry skin and I was a bit skeptical before purchasing this but I’m glad I bought it. It has nice light weight texture ( looks weird at the beginning) and a refreshing scent. Helps with redness and gives a Dewy/glowy look and feels cooling on the skin like water. I totally recommend it
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,USA,Nice,"I adore Bobbi brown vitamin face base but sometimes it leaves me wanting a little more hydration. This is straight hydration. It’s a thin consistency and feels cooling and more on the watery side. It doesn’t smooth my skin the way the vitamin face base does, but it adds a nice sheen to my skin without making me look oily or greasy. My foundation looks great over it all day as well. If they could get this formula to smooth like the vitamin face base it would be a home run"
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,USA,A Must Have Forever,I love this product! It’s only been two weeks and my skin is glowing and soo soft. I definitely recommend. You won’t regret it.
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,USA,My best discovery this decade,Best hydration ever.  Smells wonderfully fresh.  I’ve dumped the face cream I’ve been using for 20 years.  LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!

BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,Canada,really like it,"It’s really light weight and my skin instantly felt hydrated and smooth. I have really dry skin with some acne and many moisturizers leave my face feeling dry still. However, this one feels amazing. My only complaint is that for the price the is quite small so I’m hoping a little goes a long way"
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,USA,best moisturizer thus far,"I have been waiting for a moisturizer like this. I have super dry, yet acne prone skin. I am super picky with moisturizers and the ingredients in them. This moisturizer feels Soooo nice and hydrating on the skin. I was using the peter Thomas Roth hylauronic one and that just doesn't compare at all, it just sits on top of the skin. This moisturizer actually feels it softening the skin and I love that it's oil free on top of that. I wish it wasn't so expensive, or wish they gave more product (but you only need a really tiny amount)."
BOBBI BROWN-Hydrating Water Fresh Cream Moisturiser,USA,AMAZING!,"My skin has never felt more hydrated! I usually have really dry skin but this moisturizer makes my face feel so fresh. It even makes my skin less red, can’t beat it! My new go-to!"

LANEIGE-Perfect Renew Youth Regenerating Cream,Philippines,ok,"Like most korean skincare products… its just ok. Doesn’t have the wow factor and it isn’t that bad either. 

I’m not sure if I’m going to repurchase though. There are other products better and more affordable than this!"
LANEIGE-Perfect Renew Youth Regenerating Cream,Singapore,ms,I bought this for my mom as a present. She has been using it for a few months. She kinda likes it. So far it doesn’t irritate her skin and it does its job well. I’ll probably repurchase when she finishes using it.
SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,USA,Just ok,"It is moisturizing but didn’t see a difference in my skin after a month.  Also, it smells like glue, not pleasant at all."
SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,USA,Shiseido White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,"I’ve used like 4 of them. Love this night cream, I applied thickly on my face as a night mask. (Because I have very dry skin, you don’t have to) My face brightens next morning and looks smoother. I don’t see this effects with any other products."

SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,USA,Amazing but pricey,"This cream is amazing and I wish I can continue to use it if it wasn't so expensive. My face broke out out of nowhere and my mom said to try this. This cream not only fixed it, it hydrates my face and I do like the scent. I usually wait for a set with special price to purchase."
SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,Canada,Shiseido White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,"Really nice, thick moisturizing cream for overnight use. Not so thick that it doesn't absorb into your skin though."
SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,Singapore,My Holy Grail,"my skin just loves shiseido. eveytime time I stopp using it and switch to another, I can noticbly see my skin being duller and more blemished. This leaves me skin glowing "
SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,Canada,Shiseido White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,Horribly sticky and doesn't absorb :'( The day cream is much better.
SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,Canada,Shiseido White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,"I have tons of hyper pigmentation from previous exposure to the sun as a teen. Nothing I tried worked. Tried acids, vitamin c, niacinamide, different spot treatments but nothing really works. I was sort of shocked when I used this by itself for the first time. I woke up to bright glowing skin and even the spots starting fading. (A lot faster as well, I’m not very patient). And though they haven’t disappeared, I’m really happy with the results and this works really well for me."
SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,USA,I love this stuff,"I love this stuff! 
Ok about my skin:
I’m 28. From 16-23 I *abused* the sun and tanning beds and lately began noticing fine lines under my eyes, sides of my eyes & mouth smile line (I also have small pigmentation flaws from the sun on my putter checks (mild but there).)
But most recently, when I smile it just felt tight and dry... like I wasn’t giving a genuine smile bc I felt my skin stretching - that’s when I started looking for a *good* Moisturizer. I’m about 2-3 wks deep using now I Cerave when washing my face in the evening (moisture locking facial cleanser) and the shideido cream and it’s made a world of difference. So far, my fine lines under my eyes have DRASTICALLY improved. My fine lines weren’t that bad to begin with, so I think I just needed something that aided in diminishing appearances, but additionally- my mouth tightness is GONE. Please know I do a full on facial routine so other products may be aiding, but i really enjoy this product and believe it’s assisted in my skin texture"
SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,Singapore,Best Overnight Cream,"My skin is dry so this product is suitable with me. After I used this one, I feel my skin is getting hydrated. I have been using it for the past 6 months and will continue to use. "

SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,Singapore,will not buy again!,very oily base. my face pop out 2 pimples after using this products. regret of buying it. if you have oily and normal skin please don't buy. only for those super duper dry skin. 
SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,Canada,Shiseido White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,"This product unfortunately broke me out. I love the White Lucent line and have been using the old ones before they switched up the packaging and added more products. I don't know if the formula has been changed as well. I recently switched over to using La Mer for over a month and it was really helping my skin. I didn't have any acne at all. My coworkers were raving about this overnight mask and since I received one, I decided to try it out at night. Woke up next morning with moisturized skin but acne all over my chin, cheeks and nose. Had to give it away to my coworker instead. Went back to La Mer to cool down the redness/blemish that came with the acne"
SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,Canada,Shiseido White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,"This is heaven!! Yes it’s pricey but you will see noticeable difference, I absolutely love it! Silk skin!!! (Dry skin over 50)"
SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,USA,best combo,"Amazing product with a small sample! Apply all over face and neck and feel the gentle texture of the cream mask. I would recommend anyone with dry skin, dark spots, and want a brightening tone to use this product. A little goes a long way! You wake up with very hydrated and soft skin."
SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,USA,Did not meet expectations,"I have been using this product for 8 weeks now.  It claims to brighten and improve dullness, but it did not help me achieve perceivable results.  It did leave my skin feeling moisturized in the morning, but this formula is quite thick and heavy so I expected that it would at least do that.  I would not be purchasing this again."
SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,USA,Shiseido White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,"It smells nice and it is somewhat thick that you feel your skin is getting hydrated. However, I didn’t see any affect in the morning, nothing left from that hydration and no reduction in unevenness and dark spots/acne scars. I will go back to my Bioderma Atoderm cream which is 1/5th of Shiseido’s price at least leaves my skin way much softer the next day. I have been using this overnight mask for the past 5 months."
SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,USA,CONTAINS HIGH AMOHND OF SD ALCOHOL,"Ok, so the hydration is fine, and leaves your skin hydrated the next morning. However, there is a heavy amount(I think the third of fourth ingredient) of SD ALCOHOL NOOOOO. It is horrible for the skin especially at such a high amount. I strongly suggest no one buy this because of the formulation and what it will do to your skin (age it)"
SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,USA,Yes!,"Great overnight mask!  Woke up glowing with smooth skin after the first night. 
Bought to help with hyperpigmentation issues"
SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,USA,Shiseido White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,"I love this mask 
This is the best overnight mask ! Is a little pricey but is worth it."
SHISEIDO-White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,USA,Shiseido White Lucent Overnight Cream and Mask,It was a TERRIBLE cream and I DO NOT recommend it. It is too expensive and is not worth it. It didn’t even do anything.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Malaysia,GLAMGLOW,It’s very good to hydrate my dry forehead skin. I am so happy to resolve my dry skin problem and I definitely will purchase glamglow hydrated Glow Moisturiser again. 
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Singapore,Hmmmm...,"Not too sure how I feel about this one. I have very oily skin, so bought this hoping for a very lightweight moisturizer. The texture is very watery and melts like water between your fingers, but I do feel it doesn't help the oily skin situation."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,"This is the one product that I will keep coming back to. I have combination skin, half oily and half super dry. This water moisturizer works for both areas, it hydrates my dry areas and it doesn’t make my oily areas look oily is that makes sense. Feels lovely on the skin and smells great! Would definitely recommend if you’re struggling to find the one moisturizer that will finally work!"
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,love this product!,Best moisturizer for combination skin I have ever used. I use this twice a day and my skin looks so nice and gets super soft. I have dry skin for the most part but my chin and nose get breakouts if they are too oily and this moisturizer is one of the only ones I have that provides intense hydration without being greasy or making me break out in the oilier parts of my face.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Best product out there,Nothing compares to GLAMGLOW  moisturizer esp in summer months. My skin is kept hydrated and fresh all through the day! I have never used anything like it. You don’t need anything else to keep the glow through these humid months! Never look back’
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,This smells amazing,I got a sample of this and it smelled so good I immediately purchased the full size. It’s a great moisturizer and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft without feeling greasy. A little goes a long way so this will last me several months.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,My skin felt like silk,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I just tried a sample of this product, and I love it! It has a nice fresh fruity smell, the texture was great, it absorbed amazingly, wasnt thick or heavy, and left my skin feeling like silk."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Strong Scent and made me break out,"I bought this because I was sent a couple samples and I liked it. However, once I started using it regularly it made my skin break out a bit. Also, I don't love the strong scent. I like to use facial moisturizers that are more natural. It has a very strong perfumy smell."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,RIDE OR DIE,"I have combo skin, mostly oily but dry in my hairline as well as outer cheeks. This stuff is amazing. Very light consistency, my skin is sensitive and it feels so soothing. It instantly quenches and lasts all day and the smell is so divine. A little goes a long way so don’t let the price scare you. It’s worth every penny. Even with oily skin it’s important to moisturize and this is the perfect one!"
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,"I LOVE this moisturizer. I always feel hydrated and glowly (but not too glowly...) I'm usually weird about scents but this smells AMAZING! I haven't used it in a couple months because I have bills to pay, but if you have the coin I definitely recommend!!"
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,not for sensitive skin,"Got this product as a sample and definitely won’t be purchasing. Personally I feel facial lotions should be fragrance free or have a fairly neutral scent. I can’t really describe it but it was very strong to put on my face. My skin does feel hydrated a few hours later which is nice but upon application I has a slight stinging. If you have sensitive skin to not get this product. Also, I only applied a thin layer but after having it on several hours my face has an oily sticky residue on it Ive never had with other lotions."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Absolutely love this moisturizer. Leaves my skin feeling like silk and it’s feels so clean. It’s extremely light weight and the scent is very nice!! Will buy again
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I like the scent, maybe not for everyone! I’m trying a sample and using for the second time, my skin looked great today (even in bitter cold temps!) and my skin feels hydrated, overall I like GLAMGLOW products, I feel like the products work! A bit pricey, could be cleaner."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,The fragrance on this product is absolutely horrible. It seems like berry... artificial yogurt? I don’t even know. No where on the label is it advertised to be fruity. It’s an intolerable fragrance in my opinion. The gel is also very blue.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,yes.,I love this stuff!! My face feels hydrated all day long! Nice and cooling when I put it on. I feel like it will literally last forever. You don’t need much!
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Singapore,Water moisturizer,The moisturizer does not feel heavy on the face. It has a nice smell and the moisturizer is not sticky. it is expensive but its worth it. my face feels hydrated.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Trash Ingredients,"I received a sample of this, and upon further investigation, the ingredients are terrible! There are so many options out there that are formulated cleaner and do a better job. Don't buy into the brand name!"
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Singapore,Glamglow waterburst,this product is amazing for dry skin. just use at night and the next day there will be no cracking. some people love the smell but I personally don't. the best moisturiser ice tried. 
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,"Has a nice smell and feels nice on my skin. I like that is lightweight, almost like water, but still moisturizes my skin well."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,"This is the only moisturizer I will use. I received some samples of a few different moisturizers and tried them all over the course of a week. This one worked out to be the best. That was two years ago. Since then, I have even tried using different moisturizers that Glamglow would come out with and those even fell short of how this one is. It leaves my face feeling soft and smooth and looking beautiful."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,"Obsessed. Second time purchasing this item. Completely in love, the scent is delicious and keeps my face hydrated and isn’t greasy at all"
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,"Feels oily, but moisturizes without breakouts","I love this product for my combination skin, as a girl in my 20’s I get dry or peeling skin even though my face is oily so it’s hard to find a moisturizer! Leaves my face looking very greasy so I put it on at night and it’s better by the morning! Probably not worth the price again for me but a good product that doesn’t cause breakouts for me which is my I love it so much!"
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,"This has really lived up to the hype.  I have terribly dehydrated skin, I have tried too many moisturizers ( i have 5 other moisturizers currently on my vanity).  This is the ONLY one where my skin isn’t feeling dry in the morning.  I pair it withh the glamglow youth potion.  I’m thrilled.  Also - a tiny bit goes a long way."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,"overpriced, overrated.","Bought this after reading the glowing reviews. However it’s highly disappointing. I put it on every night before bed and every morning I wake up feeling like I forgot to moisturize my face. This doesn’t happen even when I used a product half the price of this. Gave it a week to see if I’d actually see good results. What a waste of money! If I could return this, I would! This made me not want to try anything else from this brand."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,one of my favourites,One of the favourite moisturizers! I do find it leaves a slight greasy finish when you initially apply but it’s does absorb nicely and works well under makeup. LOVE the smell and packaging. You also don’t need a lot of product
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Amazing,I have gone through about 4 of these they are the best I have oily skin and Thai just makes my skin feel amazing my dad even steals it from me sometimes .
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Luxury,"I loved - truly loved, the way it made my skin feel. I will eventually buy this again. It is pricey but it lasted me a month. I also loved the smell and because of that, this is a luxury item for me."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,disappointment,I love the company and many of their other products but not this one. I’ve not noticed an improvement of my skin and the texture seems odd. Overall I don’t feel like it’s doing anything.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,My new fav Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The smell and the feel is incredible!!! I love this stuff so much. I’ll definitely be checking out other glam glow products. It’s a light candy type smell.. to me I smell cotton candy. No oily feel left behind, and best of all I don’t feel that it bothers my sensitive skin at all- which is pretty shocking considering how good it smells."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Great for teen daughter,Love the smell of this product. Very hydrating and works as both moisturizer and primer to get ready for whatever you want to put on next.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,"If you're looking for flawless makeup & glowing look, this product gives you the look you wish for. I apply this before I put primer and foundation on my skin. 10/10"
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Not what I expected,"I'm always on the lookout for good moisturizers. When reading the reviews and description, I was hoping this would be lightweight yet moisturizing. The smell was REALLY overpowering, and it was heavier than I thought it would be. I had to return it."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,This is not meant for oily skin.,"I only use GLAMGLOW products for my skincare routine. Their SUPER line of products that's meant for oily and acne prone skin. I received this sample from their actual website when I made an order. I have an oil factory underneath my skin, so I need something thin, light, and loose consistency. This was too thick of a layer on my oily skin that it left it really shiny and sticky. My face is normally shiny everyday, so when I wash my face, I crave a  matte finish. I had to wash this off. I recommend this for people with drier skin. As you can see in my picture, there's little white beads that burst on your skin when you rub in the moisturizer. Pretty cool concept if you have the dry skin for it. I have this two stars because it didn't work for NE, personally, but I know GLAMGLOW as a brand and the products I use from them are all high quality, so I will still recommend this for people with dry skin."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Perfect,"It’s my favorite day moisturizer for the face, it works perfect for my combine skin leaving it healthy and fresh all day."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Just fine but not worth the price.,"Ok this is a decent moisturizer for normal, combo or oily skin.  It’s fine used solo for my normal/dry skin but only in the summer.  It does have a very slight plumping effect (I also use this as an eye cream and the plumping is more noticeable under my eyes).  However....there are a couple of amazing Korean brands of “water” cream that are not only far superior, both in hydration and plumping, but are also less than $20 and for a larger size.  Some good ones are by Missha and Wonjin.  After finding these two much more affordable options, I would never ever ever pay the Glamglow price.  Not only are the K brand creams better overall but both are much less fragranced, in fact in the Wonjin Water Bomb cream, I cannot detect any fragrance at all."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Disappointed in this. Super strong fragrance and does nothing for my skin but instead broke me out. Beware.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,don't recommend this product,"I purchased this product for my dry skin but stopped using after awhile because:
1. Very strong scent, makes my eyes tear when nearby. I very rearly experience this with other fragranced moisturizers.
2. Weird reaction to my skin: it melts down, somehow becomes watery however it does not sink into the skin to hydrate it, resulting in a very dehydrated skin overtime.

I consider it overpriced, inefficient for me and did not seem to bring any benefits or moisture to my dry skin. thus I cannot recommend it, there are better alternatives on the market"
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Singapore,Must Buy for Dry/Sensitive Skin! ,My skin condition is very drying to the extend of flaking and this has really helped improve the water loss in my skin. I really recommend for any one with dry/sensitive skin.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,"This is such a lightweight yet somehow really hydrating moisturizer that doesn't leave me feeling greasy or filmy. A little goes a long way, especially because of my oily skin, one jar lasts me a whole year. The scent is fresh and citrusy, so it smells as refreshing as it feels. I use this every night."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,good,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) was pretty good made my skin feel super smooth super glowy and HYDRATED during the whole day. Fragrance is a minus tho
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,The fragrance is really strong and smells very artificial. I couldn’t figure out why i was breaking out along my chin and underneath my chin until I stopped using this moisturizer. Turns out it breaks me out in clusters and now I don’t know how to get rid of the little bumps
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Strong fragrance,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product as a sample, and likely won't purchase the full size. The biggest issue for me is the strong smell; it's almost sickeningly sweet, like artificial watermelon candy. I can't imagine wearing it every day. When applied to the skin, it has a silicone-like texture. I'm oily to combination, so it just may not be the right formulation for me. On the plus side, it absorbs quickly."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,I actually love this moisturizer. I’ve had a lot of problems with moisturizers causing me to break out and finally found one that doesn’t. It’s super light weight and smells delicious. Best of all I’ve had no skin problems while using this!
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Nothing beneficial,"I received a sample of this and l looked it up to find out some more about it. Initially I thought this would be comparabel to the Neutrogena water gel and was interested to compare. I do have dry skin and I don't feel like the Neutrogena water gel does anything beneficial for my face. The consistencies are a bit different, but I had similar results with this product. I didn't break out and my skin didn't feel dry but I didn't feel like I got anything out of it. If you like the Neutrogena water gel you would probable like this."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Not Great for Dry Skin,"I purchased this product for a second time in May 2020, and did not like it as much as it did the first time. It doesn't really do a lot for my skin when it comes to dryness and leaves it feeling oily and sticky. It's also way overpriced - your money is probably better spent on a different product if you have dry skin!"
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,SPF? Not Sure but its amazing!,"This product started it all. I recieved a sample in a fabfitfun box and I have been repurchasing for 2 years now. 
I have extremely dry skin and I am over 30 so it isn't getting any better. I also have had trouble with acne in the past from certain products. 
This hydrates and feels amazing for days as well as it has never made my face break out! 
I wish it had spf-or I could find what SPF was in it so I don't have to keep trying other formulas out."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Malaysia,moisturizer ,First time trying this product. Heard from friend recommending this brand. Upon applying I could feel skin plump and hydrated. It takes awhile to get it fully absorbed 
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Malaysia,hydrating ,This moisturiser gives 100% hydration to your skin. This is my saviour for my dry skin. It also last for almost two months. Very light texture and absorb to you skin real easy. 
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,"Not for sensitive skin, my friend recommended this to me as she lovessss this. But this broke me out and aggravated my skin very very much, it wasn’t moisturizing, sat on top of my skin and has very intense fragrance which my skin does not like. I’d recommend sampling this before committing to such an expensive products."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,"Save your money...DO NOT BUY THIS !!!
I got a sample from Sephora.. and I felt it’s a good product so I bought the full size product and It burned my skin so badly...maybe it’s not good for sensitive skin like mine..."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Sticking with Tatcha,Out of all the moisturizers I've ever purchased I'm really disappointed in this one. It smells a little to overbearing and on top of it really doesn't absorb well. I bought it thinking it would be like the Tatcha water moisturizer but its honestly just been disappointing. I have acne prone skin and I can't say it caused breakouts but I don't notice any real difference after daily use. I'm going to switch back to Tatcha for sure.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,smells amazing,Bought this over a year ago and I still have some left so it’s worth the money because a little product goes a long way. Very hydrating. The one thing that makes this product stand out over other moisturizers is that it smells SO good.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,"Amazing, i have very dry skin and this does wonders! Ive tried other creams but this one feels lightweight, but works well! And doesn’t leave your skin looking oily. Plus the scent is amazing"
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Singapore,Awesome ,"Very hydrating indeed and i love the texture, it gives off water after rubbing off my skin, the only thing i dont like is the smell, its too sweet, i’d prefer sth more fresh smelling"
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,"Nothing special, save your money","Ehh, not really worth the price. I have extremely dry skin and I didn’t feel this really worked better than any other hyaluronic acid moisturizer. I used this for 3 months at night only since it looks HORRIBLE under makeup during the day. Extremely greasy and does not dry down. Ended up using the rest of this on my arms and legs just so it wouldn’t go to waste."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Moisturizing but VERY strong smell,"(I've been using it for a year now) Pros: It's a very lightweight moisturizer that absorbs fast yet manages keeps your skin hydrated the whole day! I have very dry skin but this alone is usually enough as my nighttime moisturizer. When my skin feels extra dry I put this on and also a layer of Thirstymud on top which really makes all dry patches/peeling skin go away. Cons: I've found makeup to not go on well over this, so I only use it for nighttime. Also it has a VERY strong creamsicle smell which some might not like. Personally despite how effective this moisturizer is for me I can't help but think that this strong scent isn't good for my skin in the long term. So right now I'm on the hunt for a moisturizer just like this but without the smell. If I can't find anything though I will probably stay with this."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,I love love love this moisturizer! It’s been my go-to for a couple years now! It feels so nice and just melts into the skin. My skin feels hydrated the entire day! And the scent! It smells just like cream-sickles.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,"My go-to moisturizer! I've tried several different ones and this is the best by far, leaves your skin plump and soft. It does take a little bit of time for it to sink in, feels kinda oily at first but otherwise it's great! love the smell as well, doesn't linger."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,amazing,Love this product! Not only dose it Smell amazing but it leaves my face feeling soft & moisturized all day!
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Waste of money,"I was really disappointed in this moisturizer. 

It smells awful (like someone rubbed jelly beans all over your face) and it left my face looking extremely greasy.

It does absorb somewhat okay into the skin, but even after being absorbed my face looked shiny and gross.

If you use any type of topical gel (for acne, rosacea, etc) do NOT waste your money on this. I apply a rosacea gel daily to my face. Even after the gel has absorbed and dried completely, putting this moisturizer on lifts the gel and makes it look like your skin is peeling. And trying to rub the flakes off only makes the moisturizer pull up more."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,I have really oily skin and this moisturizer has been really good! It doesn’t make my skin oily but makes it really soft and supple.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Soft and Very Moisturized Skin,I got this in a Play! Box and love it. It definitely keeps my face soft and moisturized all day. It smells wonderful!
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I do not like this. Mainly because it’s very tacky and sticky on my skin. I do not like the feel of it and the bubblegum scent is nice but can be overpowering. Not my fav. Love the packaging!
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,the best,Love this! Leaves my face feeling soft and glowing!
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Might be good if you have easy to please skin,"Okay, so I went into my local Sephora because I was in need of a good moisturizer for my very dramatic skin. Basically I get very dry patches of skin on my cheeks sometimes and constantly have an oily T-zone along with stress and hormonal acne breakouts on the lower half of my face so it's hard to find a moisturizer that works for me. I told this all to the sales lady and she basically showed me a bunch of different ones that all had the same texture as the drunk elephant Protini moisturizer (as I found I liked that one but it wasn't hydrating enough for how dry my skin can get). She showed me this glam glow mask and told me it wasn't scented (I couldn't really tell because she'd put a lot of strongly scented moisturizers on my hand before we got to this one) and I liked the consistency and decided to buy it.

I do like how hydrating this moisturizer is and the consistency is quite nice BUT it is very very strongly scented and is not good if you have extremely oily skin! My acne has also gotten much worse since I started using it. 

If you can handle a strong smelling cream and have easy to please skin then this may work for you."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Love this moisturizer! Leaves my skin feeling sooo soft and silky the next morning.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,I love this moisturizer. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth. Has a very sweet scent.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,I have been using this for a few weeks after getting it for Christmas! I have very dry skin and typically go for thick Moisturizers so I didn’t think I would like this - but I think I will be re purchasing this. It’s not very thick and absorbs quickly but leaves you feeling hydrated
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,"Nightmare ""moisturizer""",This product was recommended to me by a sales associate in a small boutique store. I REALLLYY wish I would have tried it before I threw it in my bag
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Way too scented,I am not one to usually complain about scents at all but this one is just way too much for me. It just smells sickeningly sweet. I had to give it away unfortunately.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Back-Up Moisturizer.,"I bought this as a cruelty-free replacement for the Neutrogena Hylauronic Acid moisturizer.
This moisturizer when first applied leaves my skin feeling greasy, no matter how little I apply. It does soak into my skin after some time, but as someone who barely wakes up in the morning with enough time to run out of the door, I don’t have time to give my moisturizer an hour to soak.
I do use this as a back-up nighttime moisturizer, but it’s just not my favorite feeling on my face."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,best moisturizer I’ve ever tried,"LOVE this moisturizer! It smells great and makes my skin feel so NORMAL compared to my usual combination (mostly dry) skin. My fiancé bought it for me after I kept talking about it (I didn’t buy it because of the price) but I think it was completely worth his money lol. I used to use an equate moisturizer and I had to carry it with me to reapply throughout the day when not wearing foundation. I don’t have to carry it with me because is lasts all day and I am totally in love with this moisturizer. Even wearing makeup, I am not a fan of primers and this helped my makeup stay even better than before."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Goddess Skin,The smell reels you in and the feel of this product on your skin is goddess status.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Not for my skin,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Okay so. Its smells good, and feels good, but after using a sample over the course of a week I started noticing little indentations in my skin... I wasn't trying any new products at the same time so I'm pretty sure that is just how my skin reacted to this product."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,AMAZING!!!,This stuff is seriously so amazing. It makes such a difference in how my foundation wears. Lightweight and smells amazing! I look forward to taking my makeup off at night just to use this. It adds a nice subtle glow to the skin while adding moisture.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Not for Oily skin,FYI if you have oily skin do NOT use this product. I LOVE Glamglow but this one did not agree with my skin.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,"Was looking to upgrade my daily moisturizer and bought this on a whim after having used glam glow's masks. So far really like it...not too heavy but leaves my skin super soft. I hardly have to use any so will last a long time. Only thing I would caution is the scent, like other have said. It's very sweet and candy like...similar to their Glowstarter. I happen to LOVE the scent, but could see how it would be a turn off for some."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,"First time using this product. This is very greasy, sits on top of your skin. Definitely feels moisturized, a little goes a long way. This formula is better as a mask than a moisturizer."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,"I got this as a $10 beauty surprise with my top box subscription (side note: if you have the option, always order the top box $10 surprise), otherwise I wouldn’t have thought to splurge on this. Initially I disliked the scent - I never understand adding fragrance to face products-  then I was ok with it, kinda liked  it, and now that I finished the jar 2 months ago I am CRAVING the scent. 

It does what it says, feels like moisture poured into your skin. It’s very much like neutrogena gel cream, but more hydrating, or like Clinique 72 hour gel, but less sticky. 

Would I spend $62 of my own money to repurchase? No. But I’d happily accept it as a gift, and will for sure be enjoying the scent it any time I see it in store."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,,good moistuirzer,my go to moisturizer so far.. using it for few months alr. soft smell so good. really love the product the package. helps with my sensitive skin. one of the best moisturizer quite pricey but worth to buy
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Best Moisturizer,"I absolutely love this product. I have combination skin... during the fall & winter seasons my skin is super dry in my t-zone... and this product is a lifesaver. I love the smell, the way it feels on my skin (cooling) and keeps my face feeling amazing. On my 3 bottle."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Best ever moisturizer,Love love love. Glam glow makes the best moisturizers... this one smells soooo good! Hydrates well.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,So hydrating,"Love how moisturizing this is! It's a little thicker than Laneige's water cream bur even for my oily T-Zone, it didn't make me overly greasy. Great for wearing under make up, too. Will be repurchasing!"
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Made my skin oily,Very light weight and smells great but for some reason it made my skin very oily. I wanted to love this product but just couldn’t because. I ended up exchanging it for Glamglow Volcasmic matte glow moisturizer. Hopefully this one is better suited for my combination skin.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,my favorite moisturizer,"My favorite moisturizer hands down. This stuff has an orange-y citrus smell. A little goes a long way, a jar usually lasts me 6 months :) doesn’t leave my skin greasy or oily."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Made me break out...,"I wanted to love this, since the scent is gorgeous (although people who aren't into candy scents in their cosmetics might not love it) but it IMMEDIATELY made me break out in a ton of zits. Thankfully, I was able to return it and the acne went away as soon as I stopped using it. My skin isn't usually sensitive, but this really did a number on me!"
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Disappointed!!,Very heavy on skin and caused my face to break out. I then bought the Tatcha dewy cream and I love it. I also love Moisturizer by fresh.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,Hydrated alll day!,Definitely lived up to its claims. I felt moisturized from application till my bed time.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,THE BEST,has been my HG for YEARS!!  I have yet to find anything that compares.  So much hydration for those of us with dry/sensitive skin.  This just sinks into the skin without leaving any film or grease and wears beautifully under makeup.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,My best friend loves it,"My best friend lives in the UK and while she was visiting, she had gotten a sample of this. After she finished her sample, she told me she “had to have” this. She’s got extremely dry skin and it’s pretty sensitive. Especially with the weather in the UK being almost unpredictable, it wreaks a havoc on her skin. 

A few months more than a year later, she’s asked me to write a review because she’s still very much in love with it. Enough that she’s repurchased it (and shipped to my place) so I can bring it with me when I visit her. 

Personally, I have oily/acne prone skin and this actually did make me feel greasy. Doesn’t feel heavy, but it just made it seem like my face was greasy. That’s honestly why I gave it a 4* rating. It worked well for my best friend, but not so much for me."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,72 HOUR HYDRATION,"Let me just begin by saying the 72 hour hydration claim could not be more accurate. My skin was plump and hydrated for three days straight during the winter months. I used this as my sole skincare product for one week as a test and this product performed. I work in the Makeup industry so i’m constantly wearing makeup and taking makeup off and the moisture still stayed. This is also life saving if you accidentally overdo it with a retinol product. This product is NOT for people with oily or even oily-combination skin. The smell is heavenly, it smells just like Starburst. Its a beautiful blue, gel consistency with a cooling effect. Really worth the price, the jar lasts forever."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Canada,PERFECT,"I adore this moisturizer. Just like the name suggests, this product is super hydrating!"
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,very strong scent,"I love a water cream. I've been experimenting with at least 6 different water creams this summer, have loved almost all of them. My fav was waso and tatcha. This is the first water cream I didn't love. First of all, the smell is super strong. It's not a fresh scent. Judging by the bottle, I thought at last it would have a smell of the ocean or something refreshing. it smells like the chemicals in cotton candy, very unpleasant. Second of all, it really didn't absorb very well. Usually because of the water cream's jell like texture, they can be absorbed easily, which is why I like them so much for summer time. This one however, almost felt like a jell sunscreen, didn't really hydrate as well as I expected from a water cream.  It's not terrible as a free sample, but I wouldn't pay full price for this."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,This product works wonderfully to keep skin hydrated. It has a light pleasant scent and a unique texture that’s not quite a cream and not quite a gel. It’s very lightweight and leaves skin feeling soft and hydrated.
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,,moiturizer that burst,"Im on my second bottle right now. Hehe. I love the texture. Not oily, very light but just enough for my dry and sensitive  skin. Perhaps they can improve the smell, but i havr tried a few range of glam glow product, the do have the same kind of unique small. So what the heck, as long as its work on my skin. The tagline 72 hours moisturize your skin is so true. I really does.  Will be getting my third bottle soon.

GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,"Wasn’t  moisturizing... it did make my face feel smooth, but like silicone primer smooth... it looked pretty at first but wasn’t moisturizing at all, it just sat there."
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,Hydrates my skin and sets my makeup beautifully! Smells really good too lol worth investing in my opinion more so if you have normal/dry skin I think
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Glamglow Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,This product is absolutely amazing. I love using it in the morning and at night. It keeps my skin so soft and moisturized
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,,product bad,Bad product. Those with oily skin dont even bother buying this pls it makes ur skin so much oilier so its not good at all. I dont like this product on my skin and how it feels under my make up
GLAMGLOW-Waterburst™ Hydrated Glow Moisturizer,USA,Hydration in a jar!,"I ordered this because living in Florida it’s very Hot humid throughout the year but for the winter time my skin gets so dry. I have combo skin and I’m more normal-dry now so I needed something pretty hydrating during the day before putting on my makeup. The smell is amazing, like you can eat it. But I strongly suggest other wise. It goes on smooth and absorbs into my pores flawlessly. At first feels a tad bit could be greasy but massaging it into my skin it just sinks right in and my face stays hydrated all day even with out makeup. And I tested both ways. My skin looks plump and healthy. And I stay pretty matte all day. I recommend this to someone with dryer skin. Probably not oily though. I don’t think it would work as well. Are there other products just as good as think but cheaper, yes! But if your looking for something more high end I’d go with this."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,Singapore,Ms,I like the smell when using it but did not see  improvement to my skin. It makes my skin feels moisturised upon application but that’s about it. Prefer using lotus night cream from Fresh. 
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,Malaysia,Effective eye cream for wrinkles,Excellent product that targets wrinkles. Love the scent and nice texture. 
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Perfect Nourished Skin with Reduction of Wrinkles,"I have never received this as a gift, I purchase it every 2-3 months and have been for 5 years because it’s AMAZING. It’s much more lightweight than Dior’s Super Potent rich cream which was too much for my face. I’m 41 and my face is pretty normal, slightly sensitive and used to have occasional breakouts or random pimples, (chin or nose), until I changed my approach to my skincare routine after going back to France to visit friends and family. I am not a fan because Dior is a French company of anything but after having lunch with my aunt and cousin I decided I would try their advice for a little while. 

It basically came down to this. I’ve had my normal,slightly sensitive skin all my life. I get a little oily in my t-zone but have always struggled to keep a clear complexion. I could often achieve a very nice complexion but with 2 or 3 good sized zits in varying stages on my face. Other times I would break out a bunch. I went to a dermatologist in my teens and twenties got into a Dermologica regimens that helped some but once I passed 30 and started getting more delicate skin with fine lines, skincare got tricky. 

My aunt told me that I should try and make sure I cleanse my skin thoroughly and have a good moisturizer with anti-aging properties. The problem with that is that I was using gentle cleansers and light moisturizers. We went shopping and I picked up some Shiseido Clarifying Foaming Face Wash, (really cleans but gentle) and my aunt suggested a Dior cream because they have an excellent reputation and to ask the skincare rep for a recommendation. She recommended an age delay system at the time. I was nervous when I first touched the cream because I thought it was way too rich but thought I’d give it a try. I loved it. A few years later, as my wrinkles became more noticeable, I was recommended this. Haven’t looked back. Since starting this kind of regimen I have had a half dozen pimples in a decade. My skin is nourished and happy."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,Canada,DIOR Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming &amp; Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Main impression, it’s very fragrant. I could still smell it after an hour from application. The texture feels thin but as applied to the skin, it will feel a bit thick and sticky for five minutes until it gets absorbed. Observed nothing for a change but this is just my initial thought as I’ve only used it a few times from a sample."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,Canada,Disappointing,"I hate the smell of this product, smells like a man's perfume or men's aftershave. Disappointed that they changed the product and did so for the worse. I really, really liked the previous version of the cream (it was not ""cell energy). I am barely using this one as I find the smell overwhelming, long lasting and offensive, which is quite frustrating given its price."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Worth the price,"as someone who was trying numerous skin care products, only to see no results, I really recommend prayer this this product in paying the high price point over other creams that leave skin dry and irritated."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Amazing stuff,I really enjoy the entire Dior Capture Total line but this firming cream is an amazing last step where you'll see actual results.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,Singapore,good nourishing cream,"This cream is very nourishing and has a nice floral scent to it. However, if you are allergic to fragrances or are not able to stand highly fragrance product, steer clear! This product is highly fragranced but it adds to the experience of the product."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,DIOR Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming &amp; Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,"I love Dior and their products have been awesome for me in the past, but they keep changing the lineup so right when I get a routine figured out they discontinue what I’m using.  I bought this cream because my skin is always too dry over the winter.  This is definitely a very deeply moisturizing night cream type of product.  I feel like it moisturized my skin well but I also saw an increase in breakouts.  I bought it twice because it seemed to get used up fast, there isn’t a ton of product especially for the price."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,Canada,Full-face improvement,"Great product! After a multi-year search, the hunt is over for a fast-absorbing, non-greasy super effective correcting cream! #1 improvement is diminished forehead wrinkles; now almost non-existent. Sun-damage dark spots diminishing. Essentially full-face improvement. Worth the buy (Caucasian, 34 yrs with history of genetic “dark circles”)"
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,Australia,Excellent,Excellent product. Lovely scent. Great texture!! 
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,DIOR Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming &amp; Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,I swear I had some bags b/c I was doing a lot crying & depression kicked & lack of sleep & this eye cream took care of business!! It’s worth the money!
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,Singapore,Rich moisturiser.,The texture is considered thick and creamy. You can feel the cream on your face and may look oily so it is not ideal to use as a day cream. Perfect night cream because it does keep your skin moisturise even when sleeping in aircon room. Face look supple the next morning. 
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,Malaysia,Dior Firming & Wrinkle ,My 1st time purchase after reading good reviews. The Firming and lifting satisfactory to me. My face lifted but Firming abt 60%. overall im satisfied.  my next purchase I will buy the Firming serum.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,Malaysia,very effective ,"A little bit pricey but very effective 
You can see your face more smooth and soft the next day
I normally put on this after night repair serum.
Compared this to Fresh night cream, I more like this one.
Hopefully this can help lessen the wrinkles 
"
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,Singapore,Great Anti Aging Cream,This cream has nice texture and smell. It sinks nicely to my skin upon application. My skin looks more radiant and firmer too. The result is on par with SK-II LXP ultimate perfecting cream.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,Singapore,Meh,"This is a very weird product. Creme that seems to be sticky, very difficult to absorb and didn’t do much to my skin to see any difference at all. Now I just use it at night just to finish it up. Will never repurchase this one."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,Singapore,LOVE IT!,"Having sensitive and dry skin has made using creams difficult as I end up itching and forming red patches. With this product, I have never experienced those symptoms. My skin is plumper and my complexion is glowing. Used with the complete range, it absorbs beautifully and you literally wake up to better skin daily. "
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,Singapore,Good  ,"I have dry, uneven skin tone, wrinkles on forehead, dehydrated skin. This cream helps to relieve the dryness. I’ve tried many creams, some highly rated ones, but it didn’t help my dehydrated skin. This cream is good. Served its purpose. Plus the radiant, smooth and brightening effects. When u first apply it feels rich and thick but 2 dots is enough for my face and neck. After awhile it will be mostly absorbed in but still offers moisture. Skin is plumped and moisturised. When you know most creams aren’t working, give this a try. "
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Works as advertised!,"Product: Dior Capture Totale Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Cream.
Last: 3-4 months
Results: Even skin tone, soft, lessen wrinkles or anti-aging, lightened acne scars. Look younger than age and got many compliments on my skin.

Cream has fragrance.  I don't use perfume and can't stand strong fragrance, but the fragrance of Dior cream is not that bad. I barely notice the fragrance.

Morning and night routine: Tatcha face wash; dab Dior lotion on checks, forehead, nose, and chin then even out; then dab and cream on face.
Best investment, if can't get a facial.
Cream doesn't feel sticky.
The jar is pretty. I'm saving for different use."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,"Yes - Hands Down, YES!","Great for nighttime wear. I don't wear mine during the day it's a bit too shiny for me, but you can see and feel a difference on the skin."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,Canada,Fabulous,"I’ve been using it for a month now. Love it. It’s made my skin soft, even toned and younger looking. As advertised."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,DIOR Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming &amp; Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,"I absolutely love this cream. I’ve tried numerous other moisturizers and keep coming back to Dior for my skin care products. It doesn’t feel slimy nor thick, smells lovely and makes my skin feel so soft. It’s expensive but worth every penny. I’ll be back for more."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,Malaysia,Good,"I like that it softens and hydates my skin therefore reducing the look of fine lines on my face, however it does feel sticky if I dont powder up after using this product maybe due to our hot and humid weather in malaysia, bought this with 25% discount so no regret whatso ever "
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Luxurious,"Dior Capture Totale Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Cream is luxurious and fast acting.  As soon I applied the cream to my face & neck, my skin felt silky and replenished. I highly recommend this cream."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,DIOR Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming &amp; Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,"I received my Dior complimentary & I love it. I like the consistency of this cream, it’s thick  & rich but absorbs well & smells amazing. It kept my dry skin soft all winter."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,DIOR Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming &amp; Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,"3.5/4 stars out of 5 for this firming and wrinkle correcting cream. Pros: really lovely, thick cream that does feel luxurious. For full background, my face routine has typically been Drunk Elephant & Tatcha. My usual suspects are DE Lala retro, retinol, protini polypeptide cream, and the Tatcha cleansing oil and violet C serum. I added this Dior to the mix in place of lala and protini for a couple of weeks. At first, my face reacted with a little breakout, but after a few days, it settled back down. I did feel like my skin looked and felt more moisturized and glowy. The packaging is also beautiful- definitely well-made. The jar is a heavy glass and it comes with an applicator as well so you can keep it uncontaminated. 
Things I personally didn’t love: it’s quite strongly-scented, and the scent is lovely, but it doesn’t smell totally natural - a bit more concentrated than that. The smell does dissipate pretty quickly, but I’m a bit sensitive to smells (can sometimes trigger headaches) so I noticed I’d automatically avoid this if my head was feeling prone to a headache that night. 
A little heavy: I put this on one morning and let it sink in before going out and still saw that my face was really shiny all day. I only put it on at night after that. If you do it at night and shower in the morning, it’s not really a problem. 
I don’t know that I would buy it again because I’m sensitive to this smell, and I like my products to feel more natural, but if they got a fragrance free version, I would definitely give it another shot!"
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,AMAZING,I got my Dior complimentary for reviewing purposes only and let me scream AMAZING!! I strongly recommend Dior wrinkle-correcting cream. It is so light on my skin and it feels so smooth. Its not greasy at all. If you have not tried it you should you will not regret it. And it is a product that WORKS. It even comes with a tiny scoop so you can put it on your face.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,DIOR Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming &amp; Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,"Beautiful packaging, luxurious texture, highly perfumed. Does take a while to absorb so great as a night cream but might be heavy for a daytime option."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Beautiful moisturizing & true fine line reduction,"This is a lovely face cream. I do think it has been working to reduce the appearance of wrinkles. I feel like I look younger and my skin looks healthier and smoother-- I especially notice this around the corners of my mouth, that the small wrinkles there are greatly diminished (I dont even see them now); I have been using this once a day for about a month. 
Moisturizing happens daily,  but the wrinkle reduction takes some time to get the best results. It seems to be happening though! It is exciting to experience!
I use it once a day, in the morning after my shower; the directions recommend using it after applying a facial serum but I did not find that to be necessary. It is thick and rich, very creamy and with a lovely, delicate scent that very faintly lingers--I am quite sensitive to scents and dislike anything strong but this is very subtle and soft, really quite nice, fresh and very faintly floral. Upon applying, it feels a little greasy but it absorbs very quickly just leaving my skin feeling moisturized and well-hydrated. 
I am very pleased with this product and highly recommend it.
I received this product free to review."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Very Strong Scent,"The first thing I noticed about this cream was the floral scent.  It wasn’t too bad when I smelled it in the container, but once it was on my face, it was overwhelming. The cream was slow to absorb and it took about an hour to stop feeling like my face was sticky. I did try it several times on different days, just in case I was just feeling overly sensitive at that time, but had no change in my experience. I really wanted to like this product, but the perfume was just way too much and gave me headaches. 
I received this product complementary exchange for my fair and honest review."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,I didn't want to Love this!,"I am super skeptical of luxury brand makeup & skincare, I often think the price does not equal the results - this product is NOT that case. The packaging - super luxe, heavy glass with foil security lid and plastic fitted lid to ensure no contamination. The scent is fairly strong and lingers for a bit after application. Scents are difficult for me to describe but honestly it gave me mature-woman-medicinal vibes - which sounds awful but actually was pleasant and added to the experience of luxe-ness in my skincare routine. I used this daily morning & night and I have seen visible results in fine lines on my forehead & around my mouth. This is the only time I have experienced moisture and been able to say a visible plumpness in my skin after application occurred when using a product. I am really sad to see that I am almost near finishing this and am seriously considering purchasing a replacement instead of heading to the next hip moisturizer which I normally do. I received this product complimentary in exchange for a review"
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,DIOR Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming &amp; Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,"Strong flowery scent,  it does dissipate. Sensitive people probably won't like it because of that.  Creamy smooth consistency that is  fast absorbing and lightweight. Love how it feels."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Nice firming cream!,"I’m been using this Dior firming cream for a couple of days and I’m very pleased with the results my skin feels a little bit firmer I don’t have a lot of wrinkles but I think this has help me a little with the fine lines, the only thing I don’t like is the strong fragrance that is a little overwhelming other than that this cream is pretty good, I’m gonna continue using it to have greater results."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Capture Totale,I received this product as a promotional item & first off let me say this smell is amazing! I love the creaminess of the product. This has become my favorite night time regime. Dior is already a luxury brand and having this Cell Energy cream makes my bedtime regimen that more luxurious. Since I've been using the product I have noticed my skin smoother and more radiant looking and I will be purchasing this again!
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Holy Grail,My absolute Holy Grail. My skin has never looked so good. Im actually glowing. Fine lines are disappearing right in front of my eyes. Most definitely worth the price on this one. Can't wait to try the other products in this line.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,DIOR Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming &amp; Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,"Feels incredible on the skin. Not too heavy, very moisturizing, makes my skin feel so soft. Unfortunately the scent alone is so strong that it turns me off to the idea of actually using it. This product would be better for someone without a sensitive nose like me. Even though I enjoy the results, how light it is, and how soft it makes my skin feel I wouldn't use this product again. Although I would purchase a fragrance free version of this item, if it was available."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Pass For Me,This was too heavy for my face and the scent is a little too strong for me. I have been using this on my neck and haven’t seen any results just yet. I will definitely use until the last drop though.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,WOW.,"I was skeptical about this product upon receiving it due to most skincare claims don’t hold up to the hype. THIS ONE DID! The product has a light scent, which doesn’t bother me, and is a great consistency. A little bit goes a long way, and the hydration level is unreal. My skin had been terribly dry this winter prior to adding this to my routine. I don’t have many fine lines so I can’t say much about those but I feel like my skin is more plump and smooth. I would totally purchase this item if my budget allowed."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Best firming and anti wrinkle cream,"Amazing packaging and super expensive and sturdy! I’ve used this cream for awhile now abs it is amazing! It blends so easily into the skin and makes my skin glows! I love how it has a very light scent and does not sting the face or anything! It has definitely made my skin more soft, brighter, and firmer! Recommend this product!"
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Moisturizing Without Feeling Heavy,"Feels light and cooling when you apply it. I’s very moisturizing and hydrating without being too thick or heavy. I haven’t really seen any affect on my fine lines, but it has helped a lot with my dry winter skin. It didn’t bother me, but just FYI if you’re sensitive to smells, this cream is pretty heavily scented. I could still smell it faintly in the morning after applying at night."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Oily Combination Skin or Dry?,"I loved the overall look of the packaging with the spatula, it automatically catches the eye and speaks “luxury” The product had a wonderful consistency, a little goes a long way, very noticeable scent if you have sensitive skin like myself. I experienced quite a bit of peeling around my mouth and nose while using this product and I wasn’t sure if it was due to my skin regimen or skin sensitivity so I allowed my mom to use it. I have combination sensitive skin while she has dry skin and it worked like a charm for her. We were both super excited to have tried Dior skincare especially after seeing the price. With my knowledge of skincare just going through products over the years I’ve found that some products just work best with certain skin types and unfortunately it didn’t work for my oily combination skin, but it was a success for my mother hydrating and giving her dry skin a smoother surface even before applying makeup."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,"Possible reaction, but will give another try later","I’m always in the market for a great face cream, so I was excited to try this. Upon opening the jar, it was a little stuck, hard to open, but after a few minutes we were good, no biggie. Now for first application, it felt a little thick, but boy did it feel great hydrating my combo skin. No greasy face, just great absorption. I wasn’t too impressed with the heightened scent (not to my liking), but my husband could smell it said he actually liked it. I finished the remainder of my usual face routine with usual products and hopped into bed. Next morning, my skin felt soft, looked hydrated and plump. Yay! However, I noticed a little redness in my lower cheek that I’ve never seen before. Possible reaction noted. After two weeks, fine lines and wrinkles were smooth, but the redness stayed so I discontinued. I must also note I started a detox cleanse a week before trying this, so I can’t say which was the culprit. What I will do is give this another shot once detox is complete. Hoping to love it more another time. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Wonderfully Nourishing Cream,"This is the first time I’ve tried a Dior moisturizer, & now I know what the hype is about. The cream goes on feeling light, but very moisturizing at the same time. I usually prefer my face creams to be on the thicker side so my face feels extra hydrated, but I get the same effect from this product without the cream itself being thick or heavy. It gets a slight tackiness to it which dissipates after a little & my face is left feeling nourished with a slight glow. 

I honestly feel like I’ve pampered my face every time I use it. Not only is it hydrating, but the smell is absolutely divine! Most firming creams leave my skin feeling tight, which I don’t like, & I don’t get that feeling with this at all. I’m a HUGE fan!"
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Gamechanger,I was a skeptic. I’ve tried drugstore anti-aging face creams in the past and haven’t been impressed. I’m turning 37 this year and decided it was time to get serious about my skin. This Dior face cream has made me a believer in anti-aging products by Dior!!! After one week of use my skin was softer and more vibrant. After one month of use I was getting compliments from friends and family on my radiant flawless skin! My skin is dewy but not greasy after applying this product. The scent is fresh and clean and fades appropriately after application. I am now a devotee of this line and will be purchasing again!
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Love my skin now!!!,"Since I’ve added this product in my regular skincare routine; my skin is more balanced overall. My skin on my face feels a bit tighter than it was before using and my really dry spots are nearly gone and my skin is just overall more healthier and looks so much better. At my age I have to be more focused on my skin because it has started doing stuff that it never did when I was a lot younger and I never knew I needed this product till I started using it. I’ve been using it for a whole month; which I honestly feel that is as long as you need to really know if a skincare product is for you and it is gonna do what you need it to do. And this one, it did what I needed and more. I’m gonna continue to use this in my regular skincare routine for now on. The price is a bit high and I’m sure that most will not want to try because of price; but it is worth the splurge. And I don’t have to use but a tiny amount each application, so it will last a good while also. Which helps so much with the cost of this product. Thankfully I was blessed and chosen to try this product for review through Influenster as a free gift for trying and reviewing. And now I’m hooked and will be purchasing another when this one runs out. Take my word, it works and is worth the price point. Remember the saying? “You get what you pay for!!” And with this product; it is so true. I love it and will use it as long as they make it and keep it in stock."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,This is THE ONLY moisturizer to deliver!,"Five out of five stars! What a luxe item! Dior always smells amazing, and this product did not disappoint. It's such a lightweight formula that never weighs me down or makes me feel greasy. I think that's so hard to find a moisturizer! I used this for a over a week solid now, and I really honestly can say I've noticed a decent improvement in my fine lines... My skin looks more supple and younger! My pores look smoother and smaller. The light scent is lasting, and every time I catch a whiff of it, I'm reminded of the amazingness of this product. I can tell it's actually doing good for my skin! And not just for 15 minutes.. but the whole day. The whole week! A little goes a long way, so a jar this size is going to last me. It's a great value for the money, when you consider all the benefits and how long this will last. I admit, I was skeptical at first. I thought moisturizers was just meant to make us feel greasy, pretending that our lines are going away LOL. Isn't that how they all work? Not this one! If you're hesitant, trust me. You will not be disappointed! I noticed improvements right away. My skin looks smoother, it's softer, and it's taking years off this face! I had a good friend asked me what I was doing differently with my makeup. It was all the Dior capture totaled Cell Energy moisturizer! That's the only thing that has changed in my routine."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Obsessed!!,Love love love this cream!!! It makes my skin glow and plumps up and fills my wrinkles! I’m obsessed!!  Now I just need to figure a way to allow this in my beauty budget! Just FYI it does have a stronger scent . I don’t mind it but it almost reminds me of something my grandmother used . A bit floral or powdery.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,This was a really great product.,"This made such a different in my skin.  It was much softer and after a week of use, I noticed fine lines near my eyes fading and I had less problem with dry skin patches on my face."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,My skin feels so moisturized w this product,"The product has a good consistency, the right creamy consistency not too thick or not too runny.  The scent is very subtle, and it feels so amazing on your skin.  The packaging is super fancy , it’s a jar and it’s a bit heavy.  I didn’t notice much of a difference with wrinkles because I don’t have any, but every morning my skin felt so plumpy and moisturized. I definitely love this product, I am very generous when I apply at the night routine, and I highly recommend.  I wear before my make up as well.  I got this product complimentary from Influenster for review purposes."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Left My Skin Soft & Silky,"I have been using this for a little over the month and have not noticed a difference in my skin appearing more youthful. However, my skin does feel smoother and softer. Perhaps it will take a little more time to achieve a healthy glow. It has a subtle and pleasant scent. I have oily skin and was afraid this would end up sitting on top of my skin. I was surprised that it absorbed into my skin quickly and the moisturization lasted throughout the day. My skin felt soft and silky. I wish they had this in a body lotion form. I believe my skin will have a more youthful appearance if I continue to use this."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,"Nice Texture, Strong Scent",The Dior Super Potent Rich Creme is aptly named for it's rich and thick texture. It is still able to blend into the skin well and doesn't sit on the surface like a film how some thick moisturizers do. It does have a strong scent of baby powder which I don't love but it is tolerable. I would prefer less scent or a better scent. It does leave my combination skin moisturized without feeling too oily. I will use this up but I don't think I would repurchase as I have other moisturizers that I would prefer over this one.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Great product,"Strong scent! Thick, high quality cream.  Do not use if sensitive to strong fragrance."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Feels fancy,"This definitely feels like a luxury item. The packaging and the product look and feel luxe. I used this for about a month and it did feel very moisturizing. I'm enjoying using this, but I also didn't notice a huge difference between this and a less expensive skincare product. If you can pay for luxury continually you may notice a greater effect."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Love the scent and feel,"I used this cream for 30 days, it has a very luxurious feel and scent which I love, but I didn’t really notice any difference in firmness or wrinkles. I received this cream complimentary from Influenster to review."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,DIOR Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming &amp; Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,"I was pleased with the quality and happy to receive this product, but overall underwhelmed considering its high price tag. It leaves my skin soft and dewy and has a nice powdery scent that reminds me of baby lotion. I do worry that it might be too heavy for summer use as it was warm this morning and I did feel a bit sticky for awhile. I probably wouldn’t buy it myself as it’s great, but I have used comparable products at 1/4 the price."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,A MUST have for over 40 skin!!,"I have noticed SUCH a difference in my skin since using this Crème. The firmness has increased, it is dramatically softer, and my skin has a “glow” to it. The smell isn’t overwhelming yet very pleasant, and the scoop makes it easy not to be wasteful with the product. It has also improved my neck and decolletage tenfold. I LOVE this crème."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,DIOR Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming &amp; Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,"Beautiful product. It feels luxe (as it should for its price!) and like its moisturizing well. It has a fragrance that I got used to, but it’s definitely there. I’ve been using it for about 6 weeks and I see some short term benefits when I wake up in the morning (skin looks healthy, glowy, hydrated).  Feels like it’s working as a solid nighttime moisturizer! It’s quite expensive, but I’ve found that it spreads well on the face and neck so I haven’t needed to use a lot each time. If it’s in your budget, it might be a good choice, especially if you struggle with dehydrated skin."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Love all things Dior,I absolutely love all things Dior! The fragrance is nice and light. I love a super rich cream. This cream delivers. I used this in conjunction with the skin protecting serum. My skin is super clear and not dry like it was. My fine lines were greatly improved and I had no crape like skin. That means hydration. My only complaint is the top of the jar was tricky to work with however not a deal breaker for me. It comes with a spoon to keep your cream sanitary! Over all amazing quality from packaging to the cream itself!
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Luxurious Cream for Day & Night,"I love a thick cream, and Dior Capture Totale does not disappoint! My skin is often dry, and using this cream day and night has significantly improved moisture retention and leaves a nice glow.  I removed a star because the scent is a bit much for me - very perfume-y ,but otherwise a great cream!"
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Smooth skin and brightness in a jar,"Light powder fragrance, feel so good on my skin! I definitely feel like my skin received a healthy glow from using this product. It also feels like it firmed up my skin without leaving a heavy feeling and smoother looking pores was a great added bonus!"
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Influenster Made Me try it.... thank goodness.,I love the feel smell and quality of this moisturizer. I think maybe it adds to my oiliness a little but I’m usually super dry so I’ll take it! It really has helped my complexion and skin brightness.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Make my skin beautiful .,"This Cream is magical, it give my skin hydrating after use without greasiness. It absorb in skin quickly and does not feel sticky. After use if it my skin start looking fresh and it make my skin young and fresh. I enjoy it very much but price point it little      expensive."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,My skin feels radiant!!!,"Amazing! That's how my skin feels after applying. While I don't have wrinkles, I do have dry skin and this product is nourishing. My skin feels silky smooth and soft. I plan to purchase this product again and again!"
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,It was okay but not worth the price,I didn’t think this was anything special. It felt really heavy on the skin and the ingredient list wasn’t much to write home about. I think there are better value products out there.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Luxurious Dior cream!,"Love this cream!  It goes on luxurious and then leaves a light, greaseless feel.  My skin absolutely loved it and after three weeks, felt firmer.  Highly recommend!"
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Love it!,This creme feels so nice and smooth on the skin. For me it felt lightweight and smells very good. I have a normal to combination skin and the creme did not dry it out or made it oily.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Love that It Makes My skin feel and look good,I became a fan of Dior skincare products a couple months ago and this did not disappoint. It made my skin feel rich and smooth. I like products that not only works to improve my skin but also makes it a feel good during the process.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,This Cream Feels Rich,"Love the fresh and inviting smell along with the rich consistency as I apply to my face! 

I’m a long time fan of the Dior brand!"
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,In love with it!,I received this product as a free sample; i really love it! I started using it like 3 weeks ago and my skin looks really good and the fine lines (eyes) looks smoother than before. I totally recommend this.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,3 Weeks In,"Skin type: I have combination skin, which leans dry in the winter and oily in the summer. I also have acne prone skin. This did not break me out. It’s a rich but light consistency. A small dap is all you need.

Use and results: I used this 1x a day, at night for about 3 weeks. I woke up glowing everyday. My skin is soft, supple and bouncy. The fine smile and forehead lines I have are softened. I have not noticed a change in the texture of my skin."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Worth a try,"More like 3.75 stars if I could really pick. The cream is very luxurious for sure. It might feel a little thick but it goes on like silk and dries beautifully (very fast compared to others I’ve tried). My skin felt nourished but not greasy at all, supple and I’m more on the oily side. The scent is very light, like a watered down citrus and cucumber scent, not offensive at all and disappears pretty fast. I have trouble with hormonal acne and on top of that, now “mask-ne” issues from wearing masks 12 + hrs. It didn’t do very much for my acne/problem areas and I wasn’t expecting it to. But the other half of my face did appear more radiant and healthy. I did see some slight slight improvement with some of my under eye wrinkles but mostly my under eyes appeared less crepey when wearing makeup so I was pleased with that at least. I didn’t use the product sparingly and I’ve been using for a little more than a month now and I still have about 1/4 left. So I think price wise it’s reasonable if used in moderation. I wish I could’ve tried this when I was having a better skin month to really see its full potential. Since I received this as a free sample from Influenster in exchange for my review I had to start using it soon after I got it. Perhaps I will give it another try in the near future and get a better feel for it. Definitely worth a re-try."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Silky and smooth,"I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review :
This moisturizer is beautiful . It's so smooth and silky . It sits on the skin so nicely , and it's definitely not a heavy moisturizer it's lighter . The only cons I have is I'm unsure if I like the price tag personally and besides the fact this does have a pretty strong perfume smell . I love the smell and I think it smells lovely , but I would've liked it to slightly less perfume smell . It's nice , but just a little too much . Other than that it's a beautiful moisturizer ."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,DIOR Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming &amp; Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,"I like the weight, scent, and texture of this cream. Overall absorbed well into my skin.  I liked the tool that it came with for application; however, there was no place for storage.  I didn’t notice insane results but my skin does feel better after a month of use 1-2 times per day.  
Received this complementary from influenster."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Amazing!,Lived this moisturizer! Rec'd as a complimentary gift from Influenster! Used for about 3 weeks so far and I love it. Has a wonderful light scent and leaves my skin feeling dewy and soft. Lines and wrinkles have reduced as well!
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,DIOR Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming &amp; Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,"I love the texture of this cream, its light and creamy. It doesn’t leave your face feeling heavy.  It gives a radiant shine after use and has a nice clean scent."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Best moisturizer ever!,I absolutely love this face cream. I have aging skin and in the winter especially my skin gets super dry. This really has been a game changer. My skin feels hydrated without feeling oily. I use it day and night. I also think it has improved my fine lines and wrinkles. The fragrance is light and fresh.I did receive this product for free for a honest review but that had no influence on my review. I will be purchasing more.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,DIOR Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming &amp; Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,This is a very nice face cream. Thick but not greasy at all. Has a very nice spa day scent. I'm currently pregnant and my skin is crazy so it's hard to tell if it's making a difference in the firmness or smoothing any wrinkles yet.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,DIOR Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming &amp; Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,"Have been using this cream for about a month now, and I love that it is absorbed quickly and makes my skin so soft! Fine lines around my eyes seem to have softened, and the cream is very nourishing. It has a very faint scent which I actually like. Packaging is very high-end as well. Would definitely recommend this product."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Disappointed,"I received this from Influenster to give my honest review. The jar is glass, heavy weighted, looks and feels luxurious. It came with a plastic spatula which was a nice touch but nowhere to store it. I would have liked to have seen a place to store it in the cap. I feel there was definitely a missed opportunity there. If you are going to go through the trouble of providing a spatula please provide a place in the cap to store it for easy access to it as well as to keep it sanitary. I ended up not using the spatula at all due to having to store it somewhere else that I would have to locate it first in order to utilize this feature. The jar itself was extremely hard to open for the first time. It would not open for me at all. I tried for hours to get the jar open only to finally give up on it for the night. The next morning I was finally able to get the jar opened and I was excited to start using the product. Upon opening the jar and removing the plastic protector I was immediately put off by the extreme scent of roses. I am not opposed to fragrance in skincare at all and I actually enjoy the scent of roses but the scent is overwhelming in my opinion. I suffer from migraines and over the top fragrance can trigger reactionary migraines for me. I am happy to report that even though it is extremely fragranced this product did not cause any reactionary migraines. The cream is thick,  luxurious and absorbed into the skin well. Even though the cream is thicker in consistency you do not need much of the product to cover your face, neck and décolletage. I did experience some pilling when combined with my other serums with this product so I stopped using it at night and used only in the morning without using my essence, serums or oils. I did not notice any significant reduction in wrinkles or firmness or the skin. I did notice a boost in radiance of my skin but honestly this is not enough to repurchase sadly."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,It Works!,"I Love this cream! I've been using it for about 4 weeks now and my jawline and neck look like I've reversed time. It smells so nice and I look forward to using it every night, so I don't forget it. I definitely recommend it for anyone who feels like their skin could be firmer. I'm 50. I received this product free in exchange for my honest review, but it's in my cart already, for when I'm running low. A little goes a long way, so it lasts."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Amazing,I’m amazed with this product!! I like the light texture and how quick my skin absorbed it. I’ve being using for  1 week now and I can feel some difference.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Wonderful for Daytime,I love this for daytime. It’s nice and rich but lightweight enough to go beautifully under makeup or just to wear on its own. The scent is really nice as well. It makes the experience of using it feel luxurious.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,If I could change time with a bottle,"I don't normally use a wrinkle cream. I have a hard time believing that a topical moisturizer is going to undo what nature and age have done. However, I gave this cream a chance and whereas my face didn't magically revert back to 25 years old, it did feel plumper and moisturized. This jar came with a convenient tiny plastic spoon to remove the cream from the jar. Although, I didn't really use it because the cream was all over the inner lid. So I just used my fingers since I had to rub it on my face with my hands anyway. There is a floral fragrance. It's a bit heavy in fragrance and consistency but, I don't mind. It is a definitely a thick moisturizer but, It's winter and boy did my dry face need it."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Miracle Cream!?,"Wow. If you’re wondering why this cream costs so much, honey it’s because IT WORKS MIRACLES. Seriously, before using it, my skin was horrible. Some sort of midlife acne explosion. I was so blessed to receive this from influenster to try for free, and not even 3 months later my skin looks a LOT better. I’d share pics but I’m very self conscious without makeup on. But this product is absolutely worth every penny. Definitely purchasing with my own money when I run out!"
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Luxury that works,This is total luxury from Dior. It’s rich and slightly fragrant. The packaging is great too because it’s heavy and looks great on a counter. The product itself is thick but not heavy or greasy. It sinks really nicely into the skin. You do notice a tightening effect the more you use it.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Love it!,I received this for free for my honest review. I love it. I wear it at night and wake up moisturized not to the point im super oily but hydrated. Ive also noticed its helped with scaring. A+
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Perfect,"I’m in love with this cream, made my skin much better! My skin feels smooth and healthy! Love it"
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,DIOR Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming &amp; Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,I must say that I really loved the scent of this face cream. I also liked the texture and softness of it. It was moisturizing and it lasted a long time. I didn’t really notice much difference on the wrinkles nor much firming. I also found that I broke out a little perhaps I applied too much but I did develop a few bumps. This was the lightweight version so the rich might be too heavy in my opinion. I did like how the makeup applied on top of the cream. It was smooth and didn’t cake.
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,I really liked the packaging,"Unboxing this Dior skincare package felt luxurious. It comes with an extra cap inside to keep the cream fresh & little spoon to help you apply it.
I applied it in the morning & sometimes at night. The cream moisturized my skin without feeling greasy or oily. It is scented but I liked the scent, to me it smelled clean. However, if you don't like scented skin care it might bother you. I really liked how it left my skin feeling moisturized without feeling greasy or oily so overall I would recommend this for mature oily skin."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,I expected more,"I am sad to say, this is pretty much your standard moisturizer. I have other Door skin products I love but unfortunately this didn't do what it claimed. I used it religiously and my skin was hydrated but it didn't do much in the way of radiance, help with fine lines etc."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Amazing!,"This cream is a total game changer! I saw results after the first use. My skin looks more even, smoother and feels firmer. I’m combo skin so this was a bit too much moisture for me to use during the day but I love it at night. I love using this as an after the sun (and after washing my face) recovery as well! It does have a relatively strong floral scent, which normally bothers me but this one is not so abrasive as others. Cons are that they are not in the least cruelty free. I received this product complimentary for review purposes."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Luxurious!,"Luxurious cream just as you expect from a Dior product. Nice glass jar easy to hold, open and close.  I had no trouble closing like other reviewers mentioned. In fact, one turn and it clicks. I appreciated the clear instructions and recommendations for applying,as well as the little spatula that was included which is much more sanitary than using your finger and helps avoid the product getting under your long nails. The cream has a soft pleasant scent and is slightly thick but light and easy to apply. As others mentioned, you don’t need a lot to cover your face and neck. Makes skin feel soft and well hydrated with a slight sheen but not oily. The first few times I applied it, my skin felt a slight pull which I did not feel in the weeks after. What stood out for me was how soft, supple and glowing my skin was in the morning that I almost didn’t want to wash my face. After 4 weeks of usage, did I notice firmer skin and wrinkles reduced? I’m not sure, maybe a little but judge for yourself from the before and 4 weeks pictures including below. In all cases, I really enjoy using it and how it makes my skin feel."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,I wanted to like it-,"-but I just couldn’t. 

Pros: I absolutely love the packaging! 

Cons: I liked the scent but it was so strong I’d catch a whiff of it hours after I applied. I’m thinking it’s the perfume that was making me break out and my skin isn’t sensitive! I normally have no problem with products like this and I had such high hopes that it would help my skin, but every time I applied it I broke out in small white pimples. I tried giving my skin a break every few days and trying different weeks throughout the month thinking maybe it was a hormone issue, but nothing helped except to stop using it."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Rich and Creamy,"This is incredibly rich and creamy. It does not feel like it soaks in for a while. It does feel velvety once  it does. The packaging is great and I love the applicator, I just wish there was a place on the bottle to secure it. Overall I didn't feel much firmness over three weeks but it did seem to smooth out some fine lines. I do feel like you have to really wash your face to get the film feeling off."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Luxurious Moisture,"This face cream is an amazingly luxurious treat. It feels so soothing and comforting on my skin, and the floral scent smells very high end, like a spa treatment. My skin looks and feels dewy after using this moisturizer. The cream is very thick, and a little goes a long way."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,DIOR Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming &amp; Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,"The fragrance was a bit strong , the cream is very light weight though. I have only been using it at night , but my skin does feel softer , not sure I notice less fine lines or not though. A little goes a long way so it will last a while."
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Great moisturizer for reduction of fine lines.,Such a great moisturizer!  I've been using this for a month and it's my go to. The cream is velvety and smooths on the skin easily and my skin drinks it up. I have seen the texture on my skin fade as well. The fine lines around my eyes and smile have basically diminished. I recommend this for anyone to use daily and for smooth skin
DIOR-Capture Totale C.E.L.L. ENERGY Firming & Wrinkle-Correcting Crème,USA,Total Cell Energy for Mature Skin,"I received this Dior Capture Totale free and complimentary from #Influenster & #Dior. I have to say the moisturizer is so hydrating; not to mention cell energy for my mature skin. Also, I was so impressed with the packaging that I made a video about it lol."

CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Intense 72Hr Lipid-Replenishing Hydrator,Australia,bought by mistake ,I bought this one by mistake I should have bought the 100h but I have to say I feel that this does a better job for my skin. It does feel really hydrating on the skin but after a while it soaks into the skin and makes my skin feel very soft. 
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Intense 72Hr Lipid-Replenishing Hydrator,Singapore,very hydrating,Not recommended to use in the day before applying makeup as this product has a very thick consistency. Not sure how the make up will sit on top of this cream. Use it at night before sleep. 
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Intense 72Hr Lipid-Replenishing Hydrator,New Zealand,Amazing! ,"I can’t rave about this enough! I used to use the lighter version before but this is what my skin always needed! It’s light, yet hydrating and makes my skin feel smooth and calm. 

No matter the weather, I use this everyday. I have combination skin mostly but have noticed that it works well on both oily and dry patches. Please don’t ever discontinue it! "
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Intense 72Hr Lipid-Replenishing Hydrator,Singapore,good,"First time buy this product. And I have used it yesterday. Is very moisture. But Abit sticky. Can use only before you sleep. If applied in the morning, your hair will stick on your face. "
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Intense 72Hr Lipid-Replenishing Hydrator,Australia,very hydrating,I originally bought this for me and I thought it was super hydrating. I originally tried this when I went overseas to Vegas and found my skin drying out while in the desert. When I came back to Australia I found it a little too much for my skin as I tend to be oily. My partner uses this on his face now though as he has dry skin and ended up loving it more than the men’s products. So it’s a winner for hydration. Smells nice too. 
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Intense 72Hr Lipid-Replenishing Hydrator,Singapore,Good for dry skin,"Wanted to get the normal type because I have combination oily skin but accidentally bought this lipid one which is meant for dry skin. Used this on my elbows, knees and ankles. It's good! Keeps my skin hydrated and I am amazed that this formula absobrbs well. A little steep on the price bit it is worth it!"
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Intense 72Hr Lipid-Replenishing Hydrator,Malaysia,Awesome product ,"Not bad at all, it moisturises well. Will buy again! I bought it for my mum and she said her skin feels supple and well-moisturised. So those with dry skin can absolutely try."
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Intense 72Hr Lipid-Replenishing Hydrator,Malaysia,Pleasant accident,"I ordered it by accident, thinking it was the original moisture surge (the one with the cloudy pink gel) but it’s not bad. It’s hydrating enough, though it’s going to take some time getting used to it. 

I have combination-oily skin, so you know that I have relatively large pores. So I use several pore-refining products which tend to be a little bit on the drying side. But I counter it with this moisturizer and it works fine. And I don’t wake up with oily skin anymore every morning. "
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Intense 72Hr Lipid-Replenishing Hydrator,Malaysia,my holy grail moisturizer,"I've been using its predecessor for 8 years+, the Moisture surge intense fortifying hydrator. I found this one more suitable compare to its sister which more hyped (latest 100hr moist surge) as I have dryer skin type.

I am currently still having the older one (my last jar) and in sides, this new one Moisture Surge Intense 72H Lipid-Replenishing Hydrator. The new one definitely looks, feels, and smell different. Color is white (the older off white), smells less chemical (which I debate about since I am used to the old one), and absorb faster (this probably the best upgrade I feel). I do feel it provides the same moisture and protection. I am not sure how to verify the 72hr lipid replenishing claim, but will use longer to find out."
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Intense 72Hr Lipid-Replenishing Hydrator,Australia,Moisturising without being heavy,"I was looking for a moisturiser with no fragrance and no actives as I prefer to use treatment serums for my actives and this fit the bill. I have combination skin and I don’t find this too heavy but as my dry areas are very very dry I need a fairly heavy moisturiser. I’ve used this both at night and during the day, under makeup and on its own and it’s always performed really well leaving me glowy not oily. I’ve repurchased this several times and keep a stash of unopened ones so I never run out. Only complaint is i don’t find the jar lasts very long"
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Intense 72Hr Lipid-Replenishing Hydrator,Australia,moisture surge,"Classic product,easy to use.No overwhelming scent & feels great on skin.Good one to pick up on sales,Clinique as always a trusted brand.Non greasy & you only need to use a little so last a long time "
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Intense 72Hr Lipid-Replenishing Hydrator,Singapore,Great product,"A little goes a long way for this and it absorbs well into the skin, leaving no sticky or tacky feeling behind. Also really helped with all my dry patches. Would definitely repurchase."
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Intense 72Hr Lipid-Replenishing Hydrator,Malaysia,disappointing,"I was under the impression that this would be a better version of the original one. Thought of giving this a try. definitely a big no for someone with combination skin like me. The texture is thick and it’s heavy on skin. Almost the same like deep hydration moisturizer by Fresh. My bad, I should have explored before purchasing. 

"
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Intense 72Hr Lipid-Replenishing Hydrator,Malaysia,this is a new formula ...,"This is not the same formula as before. It is sticky, and does not absorb well to skin. Skin feels heavy, the feeling is the same when you are wearing drugstore ‘cream’ product. This is not something that I expect from Clinique, I highly doubt that I will repurchase it.. "
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Intense 72Hr Lipid-Replenishing Hydrator,Malaysia,very good product ,This is much more hydrated compare to the original one. The moist quickly absorb into skin and doesn’t leave sticky feeling. So YAY... it’s gonna be a repeat purchase after this =)

I received a sample of this Intensive Fortifying Cream, and I was surprised that it lasted over a week and I was using it twice a day! The texture is thick but melts easily into my skin, I only have to use a minimal amount - especially when used together with the Hydro-Lotion. Definitely recommend this cream as it made my skin more hydrated, plumper, and smells great too!"
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,A nice luxurious cream.,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have been using this cream with my evening routine and have been enjoying it. It has a lovely consistency, a pleasant scent and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. It is a very pricey product as all products in this line are, but I do find them to be very similar and comparable to other Shi Seido products and skincare lines. Personally I would likely opt for those products over this one simply due to price point and because I get very similar results from Shi Seido products as I do with these. There may be long term benefits that I am unable to comment on, but based on my experience so far, these are lovely products."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Very hydrating and moisturizing cream!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) My skin looked dry and dull before the cream, and after the cream, my skin became more smooth and hydrated. The cream is not
too thick and not too thin, and it was just the perfect texture to apply on my skin. It was effective at hydrating and moisturizing my skin because my skin felt more smooth afterward. I would recommend to a friend.|"

Cream is rich and lightweight which is great for dehydration. The weather in Vancouver was still quite dry so this helped tremendously with my nightcare routine.

CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Leaves skin glowing but not for combination skin,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product for free from @influester and from cle de peau in exchange for my honest review... unfortunately I really tried to like this cream but it literally made me breakout. This cream does feel super soft but for my combination skin it just didn't work. Also there seems to be some mica in it cause it left my skin bling looking like I was just dusted with sparkly dust in my face. This cream is thick but it doesn't feel super heavy. It does have a light scent which to me smells like most shiseido products I use (hard to describe). I do think that this cream would benefit those with normal to dry skin vs. Combination.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Cream - 50 ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I liked the feel of this cream on my skin but I actually find I need a bit more hydration. I am coming out of winter dry skin season so this might be better for me the rest of the year. I did find it really light and you could tell it was made from quality ingredients based on how well it felt on my skin. Not greasy at all.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Cream - 50 ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a lightweight feeling gel-cream consistency with that signature Cle de Peau scent. I found this was not hydrating enough for me - I used it at night and my nose started to feel dry an hour after; I used it in the daynight and by the time lunchtime came around, my cheeks and forehead felt dry enough that I needed to reapply my moisturizer. A nice texture for a moisturizer but this would likely work better for someone with normal to oily skin, and not my dry dehydrated (and sometimes flaky) skin."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,"Rich, yet lightweight","(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The Intensive Fortifying Cream is indeed a rich, luxurious cream that leaves my skin feeling so plump and hydrated. I was worried that because the cream is so rich, it would feel very heavy on my skin. But I was quite pleasantly surprised by how lightweight it feels. This cream is definitely wonderful for those with dry skin, as it provides so much hydration without feeling greasy. It also layers very nicely on top of other products and does not pill. After using the cream for a couple of weeks, my skin feels so smooth and soft."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,luxurious hydrating moisturizer,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) My skin gets dry after washing my face and this serum makes me feel fully hydrated and glowy after. I feel my skin is effectively hydrated after applying this cream.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Very moisturizing and non-greasy,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This face cream is thick and very moisturizing without feeling greasy. Before using the cream, my skin was dull and yellow. After applying the cream, my skin looked more smooth, plump and radiant. Since it has a thicker texture, I would recommend using this as a night cream. This is a great face cream I would recommend to friends and family."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Great night cream for mature skin,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This was a great addition to my nighttime skin routine. Lightweight and absorbed quickly without feeling greasy. My skin isn’t overly dry but at 50 yo more hydration is better than none. Highly recommend this product. High price point is the only reason it didn’t get 5 stars . #influenster
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Luxe,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) A smooth and silky night cream. I immediately felt “luxurious” using this - it absorbs beautifully into my skin and makes my skin feel extra supple and soft. 

I’m under 30 and not sure that my skin needs this cream (yet), especially given the price. I got a small deluxe sample (5mL) in exchange for an honest review"
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Best for winters!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Wow what a luxurious cream! This is exactly what my skin needed all this while. Super hydrating and didn’t feel the need to reapply throughout the day. I have been looking for something like this for my mum as she has super dry skin and I know she will be excited to try this.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Cream - 50 ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I've been using it for a week and I didn't find it too moisturising for my very dry skin in Canadians winter. It's pretty light texture, may be good for people with oily skin as it's not greasy at all while it still has certain degree of moisturization"
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Luxurious,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is such a luxurious moisturizing cream.My skin is the worst during winter and this cream has amazing done well while applying for the first time itself .my skin never felt this way,it is way more soft baby like which I always wished and did not have any breakouts.The texture of the cream is velvety and silky."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Cream - 50 ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) My skin so needed this cream especially the winter times. It intensely moisturizes through the night. Normally, I will wake up and see some fine hydration lines on my forehead but after using this cream a few nights, I don’t see it in the morning. My forehead needed a lot of hydrations!"
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Amazing cream!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is one of the most lux moisturisers I’ve used and I might have to bite the bullet and splurge on getting the full size.

It’s nice and thick, but very creamy and easily works into the skin and absorbs it immediately. It’s non-greasy at all, which I love (especially with oily to combination skin, I don’t like applying creams that are giving me grease ball vibes and having the possibility of causing breakouts)! I layer this cream on on top of my serum, but only at night because I like thicker creams for more skin hydration when I sleep, and lighter creams for the daytime."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Cream - 50 ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Loved this cream. It’s so thick and moisturizing. You only need a tiny bit to do your whole face and neck. I haven’t noticed any difference in regards to anti aging but I my issues are mostly dry skin.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Soft and hydrated,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received sample size of this product from Influenster  and frankly speaking this is just as good as it requied  for my dry skin. During specially in winters this fortifying cream application made my skin more soft and hydrated. Looking forward for long term results.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Absorbs well,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This cream is nice to smell, it has that luxurious smell that's not too overwhelming, in my opinion. I have dry skin, especially during winter, it gets even drier. Once applied, the cream absorbs well into my skin. It doesn't have a too thicky feel. You will see greater results when used at night before sleep. To be honest, I feel you can easily replace this cream with a cheaper option."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Cream - 50 ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The intensive fortifying cream was VERY hydrating. I appreciate that since I have quite dry skin, especially in the winter months. 
It’s expensive, but I really liked it. Only thing is that I wish that they would make the scent more subtle."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Hydrating but light!,"This is a nice thin cream that has a luxurious fragrance to it. I have yet to witness the anti-aging properties but it does help with hydrating the skin. As a result, no more dry skin for me!"
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Cream - 50 ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Isn’t really worth the price if I’m honest. You could get the same results with a CeraVe moisturizer and without side effects from fragrance if you are sensitive to fragrance. WAY too fragranced in my opinion. Just a normal moisturizer, there’s nothing really special here."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Not greasy at all!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received these awesome @cledepeaubeaute sample from #influenster for an honest review. The Intensive Fortifying Cream provides a powerful rush of moisture as it fights factors that accelerate signs of aging.

CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Pretty good,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received a complimentary product to try. I’ve used cle de peau’s products before and have always been impressed with their products! I love moisturizing creams but I feel like you need to give it some time to see results. Since I only got a small sample, my first thought was that it had minimal scent, light and creamy. Definitely feels luxurious on the skin!"
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Not moisturizing enough,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I also got a very small sample of this product to try. The cream was a bit thinner than what I’d normally like, so I had to use more on my face. Even then, the cream didn’t feel like it provided enough of a barrier to keep my skin feeling hydrated."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Not bad,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Received a sample from influenster, and I have to say that its thick and rich and smells amazing but wasnt enough for my dry skin specially with the weather beinh so cold. Had to reapply to get the desired moisture."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Very light cream!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this as a complimentary sample to give an honest review. This product was ok for me. I really needed to use it twice a day to get the hydration my skin needed. I don't feel my skin is dry, but this product wasn't hydrating as much as I needed. My preference is a heavier cream though so if your skin is used to that this may not be the product for you."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Hydrating and Firmness,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I am so thankful to have gotten the opportunity to try this line of products. This cream, I don’t need to use after using the hydrator and serum BUT this is perfect for adding some additional hydration and firmness to targeted areas. It is thankfully scent free and I feel immediate results upon applying to my face. That being said, its key to note that consistency is key.

The cream is definitely powerful but luckily it isn’t heavy nor greasy so it pairs well with my combination, sensitive skin."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Dry skin healer!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I receive this as a complimentary sample to try from Influenster.

I didn't see any visible differences after using it and the strong plastic smell was a bit unpleasant, cause I found it to linger on my face for awhile"
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Love the smell and texture,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Love love love the moisturizer! Smells absolutely amazing and you only need a very small amount of cream for your face to be nicely coated. Would recommend!

I strongly beliveve Japanese products are superior as you can tell their skin is amazing. Such a beautiful packaging as well!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Worth a try,"I wanted to love this because the world needs more nursing safe anti-aging products. I also purchased the serum elsewhere (was out of stock here) and both have odd textures. The serum is sticky, and this takes a minute to soak in. Both do seem to work fairly, if not amazingly, well, so if you need nursing safe and anti-aging combo, it's worth a try."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,love the way my skin feels,"Loving this moisturizer. I am using both mornings and evening’s for the last 3 consecutive days. I am using it in conjunction with the No3 Exotic Goddess Ageless Serum. I didn’t know much about the brand and took a chance after reading some of the reviews. I am already seeing results of plump and supple skin. Also a decrease in redness and bumps. I am very pleased overall, and the scent is very mild and natural smelling to me. Would recommend."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Fragrance overload,"Just no for me. I read the ingredients before purchasing and knew it had some fragrance. But, sorry to say this cream that is clean smells like straight up perfume to me. I could not get passed that. Used it once and just could not handle how strong it was. It is hydrating but, not wow enough to continue to use it."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,"Holy church lady perfume, Batman!","The formula seems very hydrating, but mother-of-pearl!!! The scent is overpowering and bothered my asthma enough that I only got to use it once. I smelled exactly like the old Baptist church ladies from my youth. I'd give this just 2 stars, but I know that some people have no issues with smells and the actual formula seemed good. Just be forewarned!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,"I bought this because it was on sale and I was looking for a nice, thick moisturizer for this weather before I cracked my face off. I’m very happy I bought it - it’s easily spreadable, it is very hydrating, and it smells good. I like this brand because it doesn’t have fragrance or harsh chemicals and dyes. I knocked off a star because I hate jars for sanitary purposes."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,Not for me. Breaks me out as it is extremely thick and I don't have dry skin necessarily.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,shes a thick one,super creamy perfect for winter my skin drinks it up. it helps if you dampen your skin when applying is smooths on nicely. fragrance is not bad smells like rose.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Love this lotion!!!,"I bought this lotion for a night cream but find a light application works for daytime too. As we head into cold weather, I’m thrilled to find this product!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,Too much fragrance for me.. I feel like you carry the scent and it’s overwhelming. Disappointed.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,Best face cream I’ve ever used! I can’t wait to use this product every night after wearing my face mask all day! So soothing!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Try it your skin will thank you,Love Edible Beauty products and I love this lotion. I mix in the sunflower oil with it.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,"I think this broke me out, and I don’t like the packaging because I hate putting my fingers in skincare products and opening them to the air. I wish it were more hygienic."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,Malaysia,Coco,It has a super thick and gloopy consistency. Feels like it’s just one of those products that smells great and feels luxurious but does nothing really. Not really effectively hydrating
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,Singapore,Good Night Cream/Overnight Mask,"I've been using this for the past 6 months and I thinks its an amazing night cream. The ingredients are all good and nothing nasty in it, which makes me feel good when using it. I usually apply this over my retinol cream which I apply for my acne. It has helped to combat the aggressive dryness that comes with use of retinol. I do just use this without retinol for days that my skin feel extremely dry/tired. I notice that my skin is much bouncier and glowing the following morning after applying. "
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Nourished blissful skin,This coco intensive repair cream really is bliss!!! It is so refreshing and deeply moisturizing plus it smells heavenly. It is a perfect night cream for me and I will probably use it both day and night in the dry winter months!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,First off the smell of this product is amazing! Has a floral scent. I got a sample of it and a little goes a long way so it lasted awhile. It wasnt greasy and worked very well for my skin since I get dry in the winter. It wasnt too thick which I liked. In the morning my face looked and felt amazing. Definitely reccomend
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,must buy,I love the smell and texture of this product. Very moisturizing and a little goes a long way. Has a floral scent.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Not what I expected.,"I've been using No 3 Exotic Goddess Serum for about a year (I'm on my third bottle,) and I absolutely love it. Although I was satisfied with the night cream I was using, it's well over $100/jar, and I thought that, at this low price point, it's worth a try, given the fact that it claims to do is everything my usual night cream does at less than half the price! No brainer, right?

Unfortunately, this is one of those products that left me realizing, ""you get what you pay for."" I agree with others that I love the smell. But the texture was strange for me. It starts out feeling like a rich cream, but then it seems to ""thicken"" during application then ""breaks"" or melts when I try to work it in... I had to work it like this to get it to somewhat absorb, otherwise it sat on my face feeling like waxy paste.

Rather than return it, I ended up using the rest of the jar as an intense body cream, and it didn't do much in that role either. I guess it's just not for me."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,The Smell is to die for!,I find this very good for  dry skin. I only use at night as I like the No.4 for the day. Rubs in well and I love the smell.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,The smell is divine!,My skin is so soft when i wake up in the morning after using this night cream! The smell is a bonus!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,"Beautiful smell, not oily.","I love the smell of this product (roses). Although it's an intensive repair cream, it isn't too heavy and doesn't make the skin oily, which I like because I'm prone to breakouts."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,"I really wanted to love this product but unfortunately it didn't do much for me. I have rosacea so my skin is pretty sensitive and also dry. I felt like the product wouldn't really sink into my skin, more like it would just stay on the surface as a film. I saw no difference in calming my skin or moisturizing.I also really couldn't get past the smell. It feels so heavily perfumed even though its certified clean by sephora. 

Everyones skin is different. For those of you who have rosacea like me I would say to maybe stay away from this product."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,"I really like this moisturizer, it’s amazing for dry winter skin but it’s so heavily floral scented I just can’t get over it. I will use the product I have ( which is a lot) but will not repurchase. If scent doesn’t bother you give it a try though!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Very Dry...,"Saw this Clean skincare had high ratings and wanted to give it a try during sale. I have very sensitive combination skin, tried some on my hand first as for every new product- it doesn’t spread out leave white marks. I put on a generous amount but even just after 5 minutes, my hands were very dry already. As if I didn’t apply anything. The lower rated reviews were true for the scent, VERY strong. If you’re sensitive/allergy prone, I’d try something else. Will def be returning."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,"I love this night cream. It is the perfect texture for a night cream, thick and luscious, which is what I was seeking in addition to a clean cream free of chemicals. My only compliant is the initial smell, I am very used to fragrance free products and the initial smell is quite overwhelming. Luckily it dissipates and the cream is outstanding so I can put the factor aside."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,Love the smell (rose) and it's super moisturizing. Just what I need to get me through Colorado winters.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Nice daily cream,"I would give this product 5 stars if it was labeled natural daily cream vs intense repair. I love the idea, but it doesn't live up to it's name.  When I hear the words intense hydrating, I expect to wake up with lots of moisture, hydration, and glow. I use this over top of my saint jane cbd oil and its nice under my make up. I have rosacea and it doesn't seem to irritate it so thats a plus! Great packaging and safe ingredients."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Efficient and multi-functional Night Cream,"This product really save my sensitive combi-dry skin. I've been looking for good moisturizer without sodium hyaluronate and with less than 30 ingredients for a while because with hyaluronic acid in any form you gotta be really careful and use it the right way in the relatively right weather condition for it to work or it draws moisture from your skin; and for sensitive skin, the less the unnecessary fillers the better that it fits beautifully into my skin care routine and works along the Herbivore bakuchiol serum i'm using. Plus, this cream works better than most lip balm i've ever tried (Drunk elephant, Badger, Kiehl's, Burt's Bees), moisturizing without clogging the skin on and around the lips. I think the key is the humectant in the product. And if you pair half a drop to a drop of the face oil from the same brand before going to sleep, your lips would be baby soft the next day you wake up. Lastly, it's the application method that kind of takes the final star out. I think the product is not as spreadable as some other moisturizer from the big brands probably given to the simpler formula. So you have to warm it up between your palms and press/pat it into your skin instead of using the slight massaging motion like you would with other moisturizers. Well it does absorb really fast though. Plus you shouldn't tuck and massage your skin without much oil/lubricant applied anyway. Overall, i'm really satisfied with this efficient and multi-functional product."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,scent :(,I like how hydrating it is. but cant stand the smell because of its like strong rose/geranium scents
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,"I have been using this nightly for about a week. I absolutely love this skincare line. I obviously can't see anti-aging effects after a week, but I do love how this smells and how it makes my skin feel. I have oily skin, large pores and frequently get closed comedones on my chin. This has not clogged my pores or made me too oily. It sinks right into your skin. I love their toner and day time moisturizer as well. I recently bought an eye cream from another line that burns my eyes. Going to return it to try Edible Beauty's eye cream. I do wish the prices were just a little lower because they break the bank a little. Still a great product line"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,FINALLY,im soo excited I have been searching now legit for hours trying to find a clean moisturizer that’s ACTUALLY CLEAN
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,,indulgence in a tub ,"Beautifully clean ingredients, amazing scent, and makes you feel like you’re truly pampering your skin. I would recommend it as a mask to anyone with oily skin and as a night cream to those with drier skin types. "
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Creamy delightful bliss,"I love this moisturizer so much! It’s gentle, smooth and deeply hydrated. It has totally changed my moisturizer game and I will never go back. Best part? It’s vegan and cruelty-free."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Great product!,I’ve been using this moisturizer for several months now with great results! I put it on at night and wake up to even toned skin with a nice glow. Wasn’t sure it would be enough for the winter but so far so good. I went several days without using this and right away noticed a major difference in how my skin looked... so for me that tells it all! Just ordered my second jar. :)
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Great as a mask,"Fantastic ingredients, smells amazing (like roses), and is very soothing and moisturizing. I love its versatility as a night cream or mask. I think this would work best as a mask since it delivers immediate effects, but when I wear it overnight I wake up with skin that isn't dry, though I don't feel like it worked any additional magic. More like average skin. When I skip this in the regime, I definitely feel my skin get tight and dry again, though, so it is hard to say how effective this is overnight. I have used other products that made my face feel really hydrated when I woke up in the morning. However, nothing beats these natural ingredients. I think I will keep trying other night creams but I have a feeling there is just nothing better out there and that I'll come back to this."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,I found this product great for my combination skin as it is very hydrating. I used it both as a night and day cream. I like that it is not extremely heavy like most night creams can be but still leaves my skin feeling hydrated and refreshed come morning
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Works but smells!,"This is quite thick and hydrating- I purchased as an overnight cream and it seems like it will be greasy but it sinks right in to your skin. However, the last couple of ingredients are floral oils and this is heavily scented, though not artificially so. It’s just way too strong when I don’t prefer floral scents to start with regardless of the benefits."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,"I AM SO IN LOVE WITH THIS CREAM! My skin is very dry, mainly because I love hot showers. It really does repair! My skin feels smooth, hydrated, and clean. It has the right amount of concentration, not to heavy where pores feel clogged. But yet it feels the right kind of heavy where your face feels supple. Seriously I will keep buying this, just LOVE IT!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,,Awesome night moisturizer,Brought this with me on a beach trip and it helped moisturize and calm my sun exposed skin. My skin looked and felt good in the morning. ❤️ I will definitely look to getting other products from Edible Beauty
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,It's a nice cream but the fragrance made my eyes water
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,"great for dry, damaged skin!","Second product I own from them (and just ordered more from their website since Sephora doesn’t carry all of their products). I love this night cream (also can be used as mask). If you have dry skin you need this in your life. Great ingredients also a strong rose scent. I also use this if I spent all day in the sun and my skin is parched. Really calms my rosacea and heals any dry patchs. Love this line, it is truly natural with amazing ingredients!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Just what I wanted,"I've been using this for a couple of weeks, and I'm really happy with it. It's exactly what I was looking for in a night cream. I have super duper dry cheeks with an oily t-zone, and this adds moisture where I need it without making every other part of my face oily. I wake up with supple skin. Issa win."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,"I brought this to a trip in the sun, as exposure to sun and wind tends to make my skin really dry. WOW! I looove this one! I have used it as a mask, but even just applying it in the morning literally changes my skin. It smells really good too, citrusy and fresh. I also have very sensitive skin, so using new skincare is always scary for me. I’m glad it worked out :) Great addition to my new natural skincare routine."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,Love all of the vitamin c and antioxidants packed into this night cream. It's nourishing while still feeling lightweight and not too heavy on skin. Smells amazing!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Very moisturizing,I have normal skin so I only use this when my skin is super dry or when it's winter.  It is super creamy and great for moisturizing dry skin
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,a winter must have!!,"this is in my top 5 moisturizers and definitely my fav for a super rich cream. at night i mix it with a few drops of their snowflower oil and i wake up with dewy hydrated skin every time. i was especially impressed by how well it absorbs. even when i go a little overboard with the oil, it sinks in beautifully. that’s the biggest benefit of using silicone free skincare!!!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,"I love so much that this product can be used as a mask or a deep moisturizer. I personally like to use it as a deep moisturizer when I sleep. I struggle with dry skin and recommend it for anyone who struggles with the same, especially with the cold season rolling around!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,I've tried almost this entire line and this is hands down my favorite product. It's so thick and it always feels like I'm sealing in the moisture to my skin when I apply it. I already know this is going to be my winter skincare MVP. If you have dry skin this is a must try.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Maybe for spring and summer,What a beautiful night cream! No break outside or irritation just beautiful soft skin! The fragrance was a bit much for me. Not really a winter scent if your going to have a scented face cream. I couldn't get passed it. I may purchase again in the warmer months.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Clogging,"This product feels hydrating but not to thick.  Coco butter though is a major ingredient that clogs pores.  With my extremely acne prone skin, I can’t risk using a product like this on a daily basis."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,A Wonderful Luxury,"This creme is definitely a luxurious experience. It goes on thick which is nice when your skin needs a good dose of moisture and it does help calm skin and smooth the texture. I am only rating 4 stars as I don't know that it helps with fine lines in so far as I can tell but perhaps I have not been using it long enough (only 1 week), either way it is a great product and one that I enjoy putting on my face before bed - waking up to a glowing complexion!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,A really thick cream that's perfect as a hydration boost. I use this at the end of my skincare routine and apply a generous amount on my face and neck. I love how hydrating it is.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Fresh,I love applying the Coco Bliss as the last step of my night time regime as its so rich in moisture and I can feel my skin soaking up every ounce of nourishing goodness. My skin looks fresh and hydrated when I wake up.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,The only crram that quenches my very dry skin!,"My skin turns from dry to very dry the moment  the weather turns cooler, and nothing was able to quench it until I met this cream. It keeps my face soft and moisturized all day long. I love it even more because it's natural. 
I highly recommend."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,"Love this brand. Love this product. I was skeptical at first because it seems like the amount is so small for the price, but I’m going on two months with using this nightly and I still have a lot of product left"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Skin Saver!,"BACKSTORY:

Check out the attached photo! Straight from the phone camera, NO filters, foundation, or concealer to hide blemishes. 

My skin type is extreme combination, super oily with enlarged pores in the T-zone, and cheeks sometimes so dry they crack. Also ridiculously sensitive and acne-prone, flare-ups usually occur around my chin, as well as tiny little milia bumps on the hairline. 

After just ONE USE, in the morning, my dry patches are gone and no longer painful, and the tiny bumps had practically vanished into dry crusts that rinsed right off.

It might be a cliché term, but for me, it is truly ""Magic in a Jar"".

________________________

HOW I USE IT:

After morning and evening cleansing, and pore-reducing serum to the T-zone, I apply a pea-sized amount to my entire face, and press into the skin with my fingertips. 

________________________

PROS:

- This brand is legit, their products always contain at at least one ingredient indigenous to Australia. In this case it's the Lemon Aspen. 

- Totally clean ingredients. Does not contain denatured alcohol. 

- Water-based for fast absorption. Product does not just sit on the skin, and definitely does not pill. 

- Beautiful balance of hydrating oils. Does not trigger acne or itchiness. 

- Pleasant floral aroma, from the ingredients themselves and not as an additive. It's not overpowering, and dessipates quickly.

- Heavy, dark-coloured jar, to protect the product from sunlight and temperature differentials. 

- The elegant box with sleeve was a sweet surprise. 

________________________

CONS:

- Price is a bit steep, but a little goes a long way. Being a handcrafted organic item with such awesome benefits, this slight con is practically rendered moot.

- Does not include applicator. But I have my own little stainless steel scoop so it's no biggie. 

________________________

CONCLUSION:

The way I use it works wonders. I hope this would be a godsend to you as it is for me. "
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,I’ve been searching for a vegan line of skincare products that are natural ingredient based. Edible Beauty was recommended to me by an Australian friend and when I found out that Sephora carried it online I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed!! I have only purchased 3 of the products so far and they are all amazing!! I use the Coco Bliss Intensive Repair day and night. I’ll be ordering the daytime moisturizer soon and will change this one to night use only at that point. During the day I use only a very small amount of it as it is a little heavy feeling under my makeup. However that doesn’t diminish the awesomeness of this product. At night when I apply it a little thicker it makes my skin feel so smooth. I’m 47 and have combination skin and this moisturizer doesn’t seem to make my skin to oily or clog my pores at all and it really does seem to help with my dry zone and even out my skin a lot. I’ve even used it on the backs of my hands to help with dryness there and have seen a lot of improvement. I constantly am washing my hands and have to use hand sanitizers at work and most lotions I’ve tried come up short. I apply a little of this at night to the back of my hands once I’m finished applying to my face and the next morning all the dryness is gone from both!! Wonderful product!! My only con is that Sephora doesn’t carry the whole line of Edible Beauty prodiucts yet and that the ones they do carry are only available online and not in the stores!!! Hopefully as more people try these products and fall in love with them they will start to carry more of the line.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,I wanted to be wowed by this. I have normal/dry skin and don't feel like there was anything intensive or spectacular happening here. It's a great moisturizer for sure and works under makeup. But I can't say my skin has been transformed in any way.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Quench your thirsty skin!,"I spend alot of time in front of the fireplace during Winter which in turn leads me to have extremely dehydrated skin.   I started using this product recently and it definitely quenches your skins' thirst!  It is quite thick and luxurious in texture, (possibly a smaller amount is required than I use) leaving your skin feeling extremely soft and supple.  I would recommend putting on before bedtime allowing time to absorb into the skin."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Divine!,I LOVE this product. Using it on my skin is an incredible feeling. The texture is just beautiful. Very hydrating for my combo skin. I love using it as a night cream and I also have used it during the day too under makeup as I love my face feeling moisturised. Smells delightful too.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Loving it!,"First Edible Beauty product...and already eager to try more! First off, know I have combo skin. When you apply Coco Bliss, you have to work it in a bit, almost like a sunscreen. It doesn’t feel super moisturizing, but it’s enough for me. The real benefit is how you skin looks. I swear my pores are getting smaller, the texture of my skin better. HOLY GRAIL STATUS. Yay for clean beauty that works!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,"This cream has worked miracles for my rosacea to the point where I can confidently go make up free. It is soothing, moisturizing yet not greasy and is a perfect base under foundation. 
I recommend this brand to all my friends and have recently purchased it for my 73 year old mother who also has had excellent results."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,Love this!!! It is great for my super sensitive acne prone oily skin. I wake up with rejuvenated skin. I highly recommend!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Holy Grail of Clean Beauty,Bought this a while ago and tried it last night...Honestly not sure what I was waiting for. I try anything and everything in clean beauty because of my sensitive skin I prefer to leave out all the extra ingredients. ITS AMAZING. It has a clean plant based smell and a nice thick texture and is quick absorbing. I’m going to use it as a night cream but I love that it can do double duty as a mask if your in a pinch. Going to have to try out the rest of the line as well!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Winter Saviour,"This truly saved my skin in winter I used this religiously overnight in the colder, dryer months to keep my summer glow in check and it did the trick!
I love the beautiful texture too!
Such a beautiful product"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Amazing Skin Boost With Coco Bliss,"Coco Bliss Intensive Repair is incredible. My skin is mature,dry and I am prone to mild rosacea. I apply Coco Bliss every night. It works it's magic while I am sleeping. My skin now looks healthier, feels softer, deeply moisturised on waking, plumper and the redness from my rosacea is noticeably diminished. 
I am very careful about what I eat and what cosmetics I put on my skin. I am so happy to be able to use Edible Beauty skin care, products you can literally eat, designed by a naturopath, nutritionist whose principal concern is health and well being."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Redness fix,"I love this cream, it’s so very hydrating and has really helped my tendency to be red around my cheeks. The smell is beautiful and I really look forward to using it every night."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Nice moisturizer,"I am always on the look out for an amazing moisturizer and this one caught my eye due to the ingredients and the use of coconut. I have to say it's ok. I am 45, have dry sensitive skin with some wrinkles and usually gravitate towards a deep hydrating cream that keeps my face moist all day. This one is a nice cream, it's a good consistency, but it sinks too quickly into my skin and doesn't hydrate it as much. However combined with a oil serum, it works much better to deliver the hydration that i need. One thing- it smells like powder, which I was not expecting since it's made out of coconuts. Definitely a nice moisturizer, but was looking for something a bit more potent."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Edible Beauty &amp; Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,"I've been using this during the day and it's pretty moisturizing. It doesn't get greasy and is ok under makeup. It's marketed as a night cream but I don't think it would be enough for me at night to be honest. I took a star off because of the scent, which I don't normally do. It's just so strong, and lingers for a bit. If you like the smell of roses you might like it though."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,Perfection,I have tried every moisturizer on earth. From drugstore to La Prairie's 1000 dollar cream. This is the best one for my dry skin. It's perfect. It sinks right in and leaves my skin with a lovely glow. The scent is heavenly. I don't think I will ever buy another face cream.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,USA,AMAZING PRODUCT,"Seriously changed my dry skin. I have not used it as a mask, but as a moisturizer it is great. I will say not exactly beneficial for oily skin as it is incredibly thick and hydrating. Please note that I have dry and skin prone to hormonal acne. It did not cause irritation to my Anglo-Saxon fair/sensitive skin"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,,good as a moisturiser ,This product is suitable for all skin types.the texture isn’t oily and absorbs quickly into the skin.I’m dry skin type but I don’t see any much of an improvement... didn’t use it as a mask because it is no so spreadable and not worth as a mask.however it does brings down any inflammation on the skin.I won’t purchase it again
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,,Good for hydration,"Use this mask every other night. It is good for sensitive and dry skin. Find that my skin is smoother and softer in the morning. Also, no itchiness, tingling or redness like some of the other face masks. Will continue to use this mask when I experience a period of sensitive skin. "
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,,coco,my skin feel fresh n clean after using it n I can't feel my chicken poles holes minimise smaller after putting on my face for 20 minutes. the price is also good not to expensive to spare. worth the buy n will buy again.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,,Very Good Product,"First Time bought product from Edible Beauty.. Saw a good rating on this.  I have a combination of oily and sensitive skin, If your wonder how does the cream look and smell like.. HAZELINE SNOW CREAM.

Before applying this i use the Desert Lime Face Polish, after applying i feel a little burn on the skin ( not sure due to my sensitive skin, cooling effect or other effect depend on skin). waited for 10 min and the cream slowly adsorb to your skin and decided to leave it over night. 

I was surprise with the result the next morning. Smooth, Glow and my face doesn't look dull and tired.

For the Price of S$55 with just 50ML NOT OK to me, but will use is twice a week and see how long can it last."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,,Smells good,"First of all... this product smells reaaaaaaaaaally really good. After applying it I feel relaxed like I'm in a spa, haha. In terms of texture it is also reaaaally really thick, so I'm not sure it will be to everyone's liking. However it also means that you don't need much per use, and a small bottle of it can go a long way. Would recommend."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,,lovely! ,"smells beautiful ! 
the cream applies fairly thick on the face. after 10-15 minutes it tends to get oily. however leave it on a bit longer and wipe it off to discover very smooth skin! 
it feels moisturising. 
it says on the label to wash it off after 15 minutes but i usually wipe the access off after 30 mins and leave it on the whole night! 
would definitely recommend it 
smells great, non chemical smell! "
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,,Smells Fab,I love Edible Beauty Products! This was a new brand for me and I was pleasantly surprised by how good it smells when I put it on. It is creamy so I was worried about my sensitive skin breaking out. However it went well and my skin was left feeling very soft after!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,,good mask,"Bought this product as it claim to calm eczema skin.
I love the smell and the texture very relaxing and luxurious.
However, I dont really see how this cream helps to calm the itch and the redness and tiny bumps from eczema.
I believe this cream works great for normal skin.
"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-& Coco Bliss Intensive Repair,,A good boost of hydration ,"For the price paid, this product served above my expectation! Initial thought is that it's a really thick and rich cream mask and I was hesistant to use a lot. However, I decided to try and I was surprised at the effects. My skin felt really smooth, supple and feels really soft at the end of each use! My skin also feels more hydrated! Love this and will recommend to my friends!"
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Australia,Pills,Pilling up. This moisture cream pills on the skin. I can’t layer anything over this product. This cream always pilling up on my face. Pilling and balling. Would not recommend.
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Australia,Very moisturizing ,"Definitely up there with my favorite moisturizers. 
I have pretty dry skin and this one is just so comfortable on the face. No oily feeling, no discomfort, very moisturizing and will definitely buy again when we go into winter "
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Philippines,Creamy,"Its has a rich creamy texture that I love. but its not greasy on the skin. great for daily moisturizing. would I repurchase? maybe not, for it's price I think it's a bit expensive. "
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Malaysia,Okay but pilling,"This is very thick and occlusives moisturiser. Goid for someone that want a moisturizer that can lock all the moisture in. Hence, suitable for nighttime only. The biggest downside for me that it pills on the skin and if you wore in during the day, and put powder on top of it, it will oxidize the powder into weird orange colour. You can definitely find better moisturiser at lower price tag."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,Boscia Chia Seed Moisture Cream,"This moisturizer is nice but too thick for me. It leaves a heavy feeling on my face after it’s been applied and for all those who have skincare fridges, DO NOT PUT THIS IN THERE!!! It turns rubbery and develops lumps over a week."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,So gentle and moisturizing!,I’ve been having a really hard time finding something that doesn’t irritate my cheeks! I’m so incredibly dry there and also need moisture for aging. This leaves my face so soft and moisturized and my cheeks aren’t sensitive at all! I’ve been through 6 different ones this winter trying to find one that works. This will be my go to!
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,Nighttime nourishment,This is a good night cream. It is thick but just melt warn between your hands a bit then apply. I used mine at night and my face is hydrated in the morning. It has a nice light scent but smells natural not synthetic which is nice. Ps I found mine at Costco
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,great for dry mature skin,"this is a nice light moisturizer.. if you have a mature dry skin, this would be a lovely cream under makeup or by itself. it doesn't leave any weird oily residue,  Actually it dries down into a Matte finish..in a good way."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,Buy this!,I never write reviews. Just turned 30 and as a mom of a 3 year old and a 6 week old I am getting zero sleep but this with the trio peptide Boscia eye cream literally has my skin glowing! I am obsessed. From someone who has spent thousands on the higher end brands looking for something to actually change my skin and this is the cream that finally did wonders.
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,Boscia Chia Seed Moisture Cream,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love this , I just bought it and I have oily skin with dry patches. Its nice and thick but didn't make me oily at all, made my skin feel super soft !!!"
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,not great,"I have oily skin and I wanted to use this as a night time moisturizer since it’s targeted for dry skin I thought it would help with my oils but it didn’t add any moisture to my skin. I felt like I just laid on a dried out cream. Also, there was no way for me to layer anything over this product whether it be makeup or a face oil, this cream always rolled up in little balls and I would have to pick the pieces off my face. It doesn’t have a fragrance which is good. Didn’t break me out either."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,Boscia Chia Seed Moisture Cream,"I bought two of the scream after reading all the reviews. I am so disappointed by this product!!! It doesn’t go into my skin, it rolls on my skin and does not hydrate at all. It does not penetrate in my skin at all and for all this reason I am very and deeply disappointed."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,cheaper at Costco,Hi all!! Just so you know I found this EXACT moisturizer at Costco for $20!!!!!! If you are going to buy it don’t waste and extra 30$ here
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,Boscia Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Leaves your skin dryer than Canadian tundra. Not for me sis .
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,"White streaks, not absorbed",I have dehydrated skin that is oily on the T zone and dry as can be on the cheeks. This cream takes a while to sink in as I need to rub it in to erase the white streaks it leaves. Very disapointed. It was not made for my skin!
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,Not for me,"Perhaps I got a different batch, but I found this cream to be quite drying on my skin. I prefer creams that leave a feeling of hydration and moisture in my skin. This one sunk in immediately and left a feel of silicone. My skin felt dry.
I added in some chia seed oil to the cream which at least makes it usable, but I wouldn't buy it again.
On the plus side no issues from fragrance or negative reactions, other than it not doing operating on my skin as advertised.
I also found the packaging to be very bulky, relative to the amount of product, and it takes up too much real estate on my make up vanity.
My skin is very dry though so it might be better for others."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,So good I bought 2,"Love this moisturizer!
I have sahara desert dry skin and have a hard time finding moisturizers that work. This one is a thick texture, feels nice on and does a great job! Bonus for the cute pink packaging. Also really love that it has clean ingredients as I have transitioned all skin care to clean ingredients now. When it went on sale I bought 2 to stock up!"
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,awesome for dry skin,I have been taking a topical acne medication that causes my skin to dry out and also causes some redness. After reading some of the reviews I thought I would give it a try! It’s been fantastic so far. The texture is super thick and creamy but it sinks right into the skin. It really helps with the redness and has really helped with dryness. We have very harsh cold dry winters where I live and I think this is going to become my winter staple! My only drawback is I don’t love the smell.
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,Boscia Chia Seed Moisture Cream,"This cream is exactly what it says it is a super rich cream. So if your looking for a deep hydration thick moisturizer this is it. A little goes a long way. If I put to much on it gets tacky and pills up on my face. I found this a great way to quench my dry skin after using a retinoids cream but for me and my acne prone skin it’s too thick to use every day, so I used it 2-3 times a week in rotation with my retinoid face cream and it did the job at hydrating my skin and reducing redness. I think it’s a better cream to use at night because I felt like it does absorb but to fully absorb it takes awhile and putting makeup on right after applying this didn’t work for me because my makeup just kind of sat on my face because of the lotions rich layer. Putting it on at night in the morning my face looked and felt moisturized. It’s not greasy just very thick. It didn’t make me break out and it doesn’t have a strong scent to me of anything. I would recommend this for sure and just say to use it as much or as little as your skin needs deep hydration and for me this is more of a nighttime routine moisturizer because of its richness."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,Boscia Chia Seed Moisture Cream,"Love it! It leaves my face super soft, without that greasy/oily feel."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,Boscia Chia Seed Moisture Cream,"I wasnt sure about this cream the first few times I tried it but its definitely the best one I've tried so far. It's kind of a thick cream, I only use it at night. I find it kind of leaves my skin tacky almost, but I wake up with the softest skin with no residue and it keeps my skin hydrated all day. I do use a light gel moisturizer in the morning during the week as I work in a humid factory, but otherwise this cream does the trick on its own. 

I do want to try some creams from other brands, but this is one I will definitely come back to as i haven't found a better one that works for me yet."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,Boscia Chia Seed Moisture Cream,"Very good for dry skin. The cream is very thick, it is perfect for winter. it is a great alternative to Lala Retro from DE and is a lot cheaper."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Australia,hydrating ,I was looking for a nice thick moisturiser that’s silicone free for a while. I have very dry sensitive skin but also break out very easily. This has been super Moisturising and nourishing with no negative reactions! Will definitely repurchase this 
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,Cool drink on the skin,"I have wanted to try this for awhile, and I found it half off at Ulta. Initially, when I opened it, I thought it was a smaller amount than what the jar looks like. However, when I scooped out a pea size amount, it was too much. It's so thick! I like how it feels on my skin, very cooling and gentle. It has not caused any reaction to my sensitive skin."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,Boscia Chia Seed Moisture Cream,"If you have dry skin, this cream is for you. My face literally feels like it’s taking a giant drink of water when I put this on. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin or cause breakouts. Even though it’s a small jar, you only need to apply a very small amount, so it should last awhile!"
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,nope,"i actually hated this. it left a major residue on my skin, and did nothing for it."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Australia,okay but not as moisturising as I’d hoped ,"The consistency of this cream made me think it would make my skill feel super moisturised but it didn’t. It was okay, but it didn’t give me the deep moisture I like in a heavier cream. I have kept it as my back-up when I’m out of others.  "
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,"Not quite silicone free, but def not the worst","I wanted to mention a couple things for all the reviewers who are so stoked to have found one of few silicone free moisturizers. I apologize but I’m about to make the range of acceptable products even smaller... as consumers become more hip to the harmful effects silicones have on skin, cosmetics companies are using other film producing substitutes, with names you may not immediately recognize. (You will find carbomers in this one, although I still gave it 3 stars since it is low on the list of ingredients) If you’re avoiding silicone you will also want to avoid the following: acrylamides, acrylates, (pretty much anything that sounds related to the word acrylic) polymers, carbomers, copolymers, methocrylate and pvp. One of my faves is Loli chia carrot brulee, or for one you can get at Sephora try LXMI creme du nil. 
If it’s too much of a commitment to go completely silicones free, (bc they really are ubiquitous due to their ability to trick us into thinking the products are working and esp how cheap they are) try to at least avoid them in your skin care regiment if not your makeup and if that’s still too difficult, make sure they are as low in the ingredient list as possible. Hope this helps!"
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,no silicone! holy grail product for me,"Finally.. I am always on the hunt for silicone free moisturizers and skin care in general, as my skin is VERY sensitive to silicones. I’ve literally been searching for the right moisturizer for years, and let me tell you I’ve spent ungodly amounts of money on moisturizer for sensitive skin but always found something wrong with whatever I bought. Finally I found this one, decided to buy it on a whim at Sephora one day and it’s perfect. My skin is pretty dry, this stuff really works. It’s a nice thick cream but it never feels heavy or greasy on the skin. I always use a couple drops of squalane oil before this, let it sink in for a minute, and then Put this over the top. I don’t need much, just a little swipe to cover my whole face. I can easily put foundation over it and it looks great with or without primer (if anyone else is sensitive to silicone- I like too faced hangover rx primer) I’ve repurchased this twice. It IS a little pricy but I’m willing to pay for it (and got it on sale once on Boscia’s website) since I’ve searched sooooo long for a good moisturizer. I use this day and night, and one jar usually lasts me a month to a month and a half. I love this product and highly recommend it for anyone with ultra sensitive-to-silicone skin, or just sensitive dry skin in general."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Malaysia,Mrs ,"The product didn’t fit my skin type, it has strange tingling effect after application. Also the cream feels heavy on the skin, so then you have an urge to wash my face. I’d rather prefer lighter texture and fast absorbing creams. Quite disappointed ;(
"
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Malaysia,Treasure,"Got this for mom.during the 20% promo where most of the moisturizer were sold out. surprisingly good for dry skin, moisturising, easily absorbed into skin. Feel comfortable on skin, no sticky feelings after applying. "
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,Amazing moisturizer,"I have dry/combo skin and this is my go-to moisturizer. I have tried so many moisturizers and they often are either not moisturizing enough, or make me break out. This product makes my skin feel so soft and nourished, but the product is not too heavy, and it hasn’t caused me to break out. I’ve repurchased and will continue to."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,"Seems good, just not for me",It wasn't for my skin. Although the feeling of this cream was nice it did sting faintly on my cheeks which is normal for me to encounter. I have very dry acne prone skin that's incredibly sensitive. Trying to find a face cream is exhausting. However for someone without such sensitivity would probably love this.
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,Boscia moisturizer,"I like this product. It’s very moisturizing, I will say I feel like the texture is a little chalky and it leaves a little bit of a film behind on my skin. I will say I haven’t seen any anti of the anti aging benefits of the product yet but it’s only been about 2 1/2 weeks since I started daily use. My skin feels nice and moisturized though."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,The BEST. Ever.,Cannot say even amazing things about this moisturizer! It’s SO good! My skin literally drinks it right up! It’s super thick and cream but doesn’t feel heavy or greasy on the skin. When I first bought it I used it only at night but randomly used it in the morning when my skin was feeling dry and it was a miracle worker! My skin is less irritated because it’s more hydrated. There are so many good moisturizers out there but I already repurchased this because I used every last drop!
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,Great for rosacea,"Bought this a few days ago and I already love it. I have a very sensitive skin with rosacea and I’ve tried so many but this is something else, the ingredients don’t lie! First I was a little bit scared of the thickness but it spreads up amazingly and really give that glow and smooth the skin without feeling heavy at all. Definitely will purchase again since it became my hero for my night skincare routine."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,it's really great,"This is a nice winter balm for me. The FAB ultra repair cream didn't sink into my skin, but this one does. I decided to try this because of all the five star reviews. I feel like my facial redness has decreased and I will most likely repurchase again in the fall.  I feel I can depend on this moisturizer to seal in moisture without irritating my skin with unneeded eye catching ingredients. I'll probably stick with Boscia and get the cactus moisturizer for summer."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Australia,100% loving it,"It's made my skin so smooth and soft! Moisturises all day and feels light on my skin. Doesn't have a scent, so had to get used to that 'cream' smell but it definitely didn't leave my skin dry. My new go to moisturiser "
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,an easy fav,really lovely thick moisturizer. I can water it down with a bit of squalene from the ordinary to make it lighter or keep it thick and heavy (especially in the winter!) when my skin needs the love
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,Amazing moisturizer,This moisturizer is very thick and hydrating I love this stuff.
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,Pretty good stuff.,"I love it, it does make my skin smoother looking and seems to brighten, the only thing is it is a bit heavy, but so far no breakouts and I even can wear it under my foundation with no caking, I think a little goes a long way with this but would buy again !"
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,Boscia Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Very moisturizing and absorbs into the skin so great under makeup and doesn't feel oily/greasy during the night.
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,,love,"This is an excellent moisturiser. I use it under my makeup and it leaves my skin feeling very, very soft, while also hydrating it. Plus point there is no fragrance in this moisturizer which is very good for my sensitive skin.Will absolutely pruchase it again!"
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,"Gentle, effective moisturizing for oily skin","Fantastic moisturizer! I have problematic skin in terms of sensitivity, redness, oiliness, occasional acne. At the same time, my skin is overly dry due to living in an extremely dry climate. I have found that this product gently moisturizes my skin without aggravating the oiliness issue or causing breakouts. It simply does it's job, and does its job well. And I love the fact that the product contains no harmful chemical or comedogenic ingredients."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,holy grail for winter,"My skin type is usually combination/ oily and throughout the year I use a lightweight hyaluronic acid moisturizer. But since were in winter, my skin is soaking that up within minutes and I’m not noticing any lasting hydration. A few times I’ve gone for this moisturizer on top of my usual one and it is doing wonders for my skin. Today I look photos of my bare face and it looked more hydrated and smooth than it has in weeks. Loving this product!"
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,Boscia Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Absolutely amazing. This moisturizer just melts into my skin and feels so comforting. No more flaky patches around my nose and on my forehead. I love it.
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,Amazing relief for dry skin!,"This is the perfect winter moisturizer for dry skin, I am thoroughly impressed with this product. I love the cactus gel moisturizer, but this one is way more intense and perfect for winter months. I have been using this every night since I bought it and I see myself relying upon this along with my COCOKind facial repair oil to keep my face smooth and chap-free. Love this, so glad I tried this one out! Boscia- please make a hand cream and body lotion!"
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,"A little on the thicker side, but still amazing!","I am your typical case of an all-of-a-sudden breakout kinda gal. My hormones were really messing with my skin and i have literally tried EVERYTHING. Just imagine any option, and i tried it. Whatever my bank account was wiling and able to spend. I even went to an esthetician and she gave me great products, but i just couldn't keep paying those costs. So i did a bunch of research and just tried my luck, my face couldn't get any worse. After a few weeks of the boscia clear complexion cleanser, paired with Rose Water Mist with Witch Hazel and the Chia Seed Moisturizer, my face is finally getting back on track. 
It didn't at first because i was using a serum from another company, paired with a spot treatment from another company cause i just thought that's what you're supposed to do... 
but this simple three step process has really worked for me,
Hope this inspires anyone who was just as frustrated as i was to just keep trying and to find what your skin loves.
Glad to say, i finally found mine!"
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,Stuck on gum,not for my skin.My skin is not super dry so when I put it on it felt like a thick paste. I just felt too sticky and uncomfortable.
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,A Holy Grail Moisturizer!,"I was really surprised at how much I love this! I have absolutely nothing bad/negative to say about this moisturizer. It is so hydrating without being greasy or sticky. The texture is so buttery/creamy without that heavy feeling. It sinks right into my dry skin without clogging my pores, it doesn’t have a scent, it blends well with my serums, make-up and sunscreen, and the jar is pretty large so it’s a great value for the amount of product you get. I also love the little glass spoon with ball tip applicator that comes with this. 

I feel as not only does this hydrates my skin but it cools and calms it too, especially when I apply this after a professional treatment or a week of me doing some serious exfoliation with glycolic and other like acids. This really helps calm irritation that can sometimes come with the before mentioned. Again, I did not expect to love this as much as I do, but I definitely recommend this to dry, normal and sensitive skin types."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,Boscia Chia Seed Moisture Cream,I was torn between this one and the Clinique one. I already love this brand so I bought it. I hate the way it just sits on my skin. It does absorb and it leaves a film. Needless to say I plan to return and exchange.
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,Great buy,"I use this as my night cream. It's thick but doesn't clog pores. There is no fragrance, which is a huge plus for me. You don't need much of the product to cover your entire face and neck/chest area. It's perfect for after I apply my retinol."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,Not for sensitive skin,"I really wanted to like this, but my sensitive skin couldn't stand it. Made my skin red with a burning sensation. Also made me breakout which I am not prone to at all. It was moisturizing, but left a film on my skin. Would not recommend."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,Canada,"Good moisturizer, good value","Very moisturizing and a little goes a long way. I like that it’s scent free and clean. Maybe a little heavier than I need right now but come winter I’ll probably be grateful for the extra moisture. Love the little scoop that comes with it, though I only need a dab for my whole face! This jar will probably last close to a year with everyday use."
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,perfect for really dry sensitive skin!!! love love,So I got this as a sample and I’m in love !!!!! This is super moisturizing !! My skin is really dry naturally and especially sense it’s starting to get cold out this is perfect !!! It’s a rich thick cream and a little goes a long way !!! I have super sensitive skin too . Other moisturizers would burn because they are just to harsh .. this has like no scent which is perfect !!!!
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,Boscia Chia Seed Moisture Cream,I got this as a sample in store and I absolutely love it! A little goes a long way! Very think and it feels luxurious. I love how hydrating it feels and how soft and supple it makes my skin feel! I don’t have a greasy after feel with this. I normally use Philosophy Hope in a Jar as my night cream but I love using this one for both morning and night!
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,Boscia Chia Seed Moisture Cream,I really really enjoy this. I like how nourishing it feels on my skin and look forward to applying it every night.
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,Great product,Deeply hydrating and gentle. Many clean products claim to be for sensitive skin. Unfortunately that’s often not the case. Happy to report that this chia seed moisture cream hydrates dry aging skin without irritation. My skin is replenished with no redness!
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,so far so good!!,"I really enjoy this product. The consistency reminds me of FAB ultra repair cream but more airy( if that makes sense lol). My skin absorbed it really nicely, It felt very hydrated without feeling greasy; even under a full face. A little goes a long way, also there’s no scent which is a nice plus!!  I have dry and sort of sensitive skin and im prone to clogged pores . So far I’m very satisfied with this product!!"
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,Love!,This is a great moisture cream. It is nice and rich. I have been using it at night and in the morning. My makeup sits well and I love how it's a clean product. And you get a lot of product for the price!
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,Boscia Chia Seed Moisture Cream,"I had my hopes up for this one, but it sits on my face and is very greasy doesn’t really sink in much like my other HG moisturizers. I love how it doesn’t have a fragrance though, so that was a plus. I’ll still use it up since it’s a fairly small jar and i don’t absolutely hate it. Hopefully this one works out for others!"
BOSCIA-Chia Seed Moisture Cream,USA,AMAZING,I have tried many moisturizers and this one of the BEST!! It actually moisturizes my skin... NO dry patches. LOVE it!! Thanks Boscia!
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Malaysia,loveee,this formula is so thick that just a tiny pea size can keep my face moisturized for hours - great for application before a primer - make up stays in place 
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Malaysia,Fabulous Fantastic!,"LOVE this moisturiser! 2nd purchase. This is the product that turned me into a fan of Nudeskin. Nice smell with such good results almost immediately.

I have mainly been using it as my night cream. Use it quite generously. 

It made my late 40’s skin feel plump. I have rosacea with sensitive, combination skin. Redness is so much reduced that some days I don’t see it upon waking up. Skin has a lovely glow. 

This cream works! It’s worth the money in my opinion. "
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Australia,one of the best,"I am constantly on the hunt for a great moisturiser and this has become a favourite. A great day and in a pinch night moisturiser. I have brought a number of times now and will be come a staple for me. With dry tight red skin often, my face loves this one. "
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nudestix Citrus-C Mask &amp; Daily Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product for free from bzzagent to try. I love to use turmeric in my skin care. This product comes in a tube packaging so it’s very easy and hygienic to use. I have oily and acne prone skin, unfortunately this product broke me out. It might be a good moisturizer for those with dry skin."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Absolutely Great.,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product from BzzAgent as a free sample box. I was pleasantly surprised how moisturizing this product was. I definitely saw a change in the feel of my skin after a weeks use. For someone who does not love moisturizers this will continue to be a daily part of my skin care routine. Loving this product.
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Malaysia,the best!,my everyday moisturizer for day time. it’s perfect and a little goes a long way. it also works great as a makeup primer. just one thing to note is that the scent is a little strong! but it wears off quickly. 
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Great Product.,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I recieved this product from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest review.  I really enjoyed the fresh orange scent, but found this product to be a little heavy as a moisturizer.  I liked using it as a primer/moisturizer under my make up."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Singapore,Nudestix,"I am always on the look out for good moisturisers and this was on sale at half price, so I have to purchase and give it a try. Size is generous for a moisturiser "
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Pretty good lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I will say that I do like this lotion quite a lot. 
Pros:
It feels very light on the skin.
It sinks in quickly.
No oily residue

Cons:
The smell is a bit strong but faded after a short bit so not to bad."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Citrus Dream,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received the Nudestix Citrus-C Mask and Daily Moisturizer for free from BzzAgent. I’ve been trying it for a couple weeks now and I’m happy with the product itself. I have been using it at night before bed as I am a moisture nut. It definitely has a stronger smell so those of you who like unscented products, it’s probably not for you. 
The consistency is gel-like and my skin absorbed it within minutes. I live in Calgary, our winters are very dry so this was a perfect layer of moisturizer needed to revive my skin.
I would recommend it to those who like to combine their vitamin C drops with a cream instead of doing it separately. 
I’d probably purchase this product again once I finish it."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,awesome,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Nude Stix Skin Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer - it is very hydrating and moisturizing. I used it as a sleeping mask as well as a makeup primer.
It is light weight and hydrating. At night, use it as a brightening sleeping mask."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Did not agree with my skin,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I gotta agree with others. I found this to be heavy on my skin, which I’m not a fan of. I like things to be light on my skin, kinda like I didn’t put anything on to begin with. I found the scent to be strong and stuck around for quite some time. I feel it also left my skin kinda oily, which is a total flip for my skin as I’m usually more on the dry side. I did receive this for free and gave it more then 2 weeks before posting my review so I could give a honest review on it. I would not buy this again as overall, it’s not right for my skin"
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Good for dry skin,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product as a free sample and I tried for 2 weeks. I think the moisturizer is ok but not amazing. It has a very strong smell of orange that I like it, the cream is thick and it gives the skin a layer, like a mask. I don’t think the product is fully absorbed by the skin, and that’s why I didn’t like 100%. I prefer light products that I don’t feel after use there is something on top of my skin, and it’s not the case of this one.

I didn’t notice any improvement in my skin. If you have acne or oily skin, I don’t recommended, but if you have a very dry skin, go for it!

I don’t think I’ll buy this product after this one, because as a said, I’d rather light texture. But I’ll continue to use until the end and see if is going to do something better for my skin."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Smells awful!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is not a product I would buy or use again. While it was lightweight, the smell was overwhelming, and it made my skin super oily."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Not Impressed,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I did not like this moisturizer because the fragrance was so overwhelming. The consistency was fine but the extreme fragrance was so off putting and made me concerned that it would trigger a breakout. it's quite thin and feels pretty light-weight but you smell like a citrus fruit for a while which is not pleasant at all. I would not buy this again and i wouldn't recommend this to anyone with skin issues or normal skin. It just seems like a trendy product to attract shopaholics.
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nudestix Citrus-C Mask &amp; Daily Moisturizer,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I was fortunate enough to receive this moisturizer/mask free from BzzAgent to test out for the last month. I absolutely love this moisturizer and it became an everyday product in my routine quickly. My skin is super sensitive and I have rosacea so I need to be extra diligent when it comes to ingredients on my skin. Thankfully I haven’t had any issues with this moisturizer and it’s actually helped calm down my redness and puffiness first thing in the morning. I’m loving the sleek packaging and less plastic. The smell of the product is very pleasing but I understand it’s not for everyone. The formula is thick but applies smooth and doesn’t leave any residue on your skin. I will definitely repurchase this product once I finish it up.
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nudestix Citrus-C Mask &amp; Daily Moisturizer,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I was lucky enough to receive the Nudestix Citrus-c  mask and daily moisturizer free from BzzAgent. This moisturizer is a very thick and rich cream. I tied it both for daytime wear and nighttime wear. I absolutely love it for and overnight moisturizer. It made my skin feel soft and supple.  I found this product to be too rich to be worn as a daily moisturizer. Overall would definitely recommend as a night cream!
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Every day Moisturizer,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love this daily Moisturizer because it's so light and airy and it's wonderful citrus smell.
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,A beauty must have!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I was pleasantly surprised to be able to try the NUDESKIN Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer - it goes on super smooth, smells great and provides much needed moisture, especially those who live in cold climates like I do. I'll definitely be adding this to my regular beauty must haves!"
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,So lightweight and moisturizing,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love how lightweight yet moisturizing it is. I Use it in the mornings under my sunscreen or at night. Its perfect for all skin types. If you are someone like me who likes lightweight moisturizer that makes the skin soft and supple, this product is for you. There is no pilling or itching. Just soft amd smooth skin. I am quite impressed."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nudestix Citrus-C Mask &amp; Daily Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have really started to enjoy this product. It is not as hydrating as I thought it would be, I find my skin absorbs it quite quickly; but it does a good job at making my skin quite smooth and glowy. The vitamin C, yuzu, and turmeric are all beneficial for my skin and it does have a nice light fresh smell to it. I have been using it day and night to get the most benefit. I would recommend and buy again!"
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nice Product,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Firstly it smells amazing. Light citrus scent and the texture is so nice and light. Application was nice and the texture isn’t sticky. It definitely hydrated my skin. I have been using it for one week straight and it has made my skin texture very smooth. I would definitely recommend this product.
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nudestix Citrus-C Mask &amp; Daily Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really like this moisturizer, it has now become a staple in my daily skin care routine. I can greatly feel a difference in my skin and appearance on the day(s) when I don’t have this moisturizer on. It really helps my dry skin, especially now in the winter with all the dry air. I would highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin and to anyone looking for a “younger-looking” skin."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,love this clean skincare product!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really enjoyed this product! It looks like a cream but has a gel like consistency and really melts nicely into the skin. I love that it has tumeric in it which has both anti inflammatory and anti microbial properties because I have acne prone skin that has been going through it for the last few months. I found this did a great job of making my skin look brighter. 

The best part of this product to me is the multi functional use. I love when I can use a product as a moisturizer and a face mask in the evening for extra hydration. I definitely plan on repurchasing this product and would recommend it to anyone I know looking for a new moisturizer."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nudestix Citrus-C Mask &amp; Daily Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product has some nice ingredients and vitamins C is an amazing addition to any skin care routine. Though normally, I prefer to include that separate from my moisturizer. It was fairly hydrating! Tried with two foundations though and it did pull with the more matte foundation, so just keep that in mind. I would say best for makeup free glow days!"
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Love it,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Love love love this moisturizer. After only using a week i feel like like my skin tone got even and glowy. I love using it in the morning
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nudestix Citrus-C Mask &amp; Daily Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I liked that the product is free of parabens, phthalates, sulfates SLS & SLES. Compared to other moisturizers it it is a bit more on the tacky side. It is moisturizing and my skin does feel brighter. It worked well as a makeup primer under my pressed mineral powder foundation. The scent is nice and light and not overpowering. Overall it was a decent moisturizer, the only con is that the texture is slightly tacky."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nudestix Citrus-C Mask &amp; Daily Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) this is an awesome, thick and moisturizing cream that smells absolutely citrusy and delicious!! keeps my acne prone skin so happy and glowing!"
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nudestix Citrus-C Mask &amp; Daily Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This absorbed very quickly into my skin. It left a slight tacky feeling for a while after application. I didn't see any effects of the vitamin C but also prefer to use my vitamin C as a separate step and not combined in a moisturizer. As a primer, I found it caused my foundation to seperate on my face (I tried it with 2 types... Full coverage matte and foundation serum). I'm going to continue to use this in my travel bag because it will take up less room instead of using 3 different products. Once it's done, I would not purchase. 
 I received this product as a free sample box."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nudestix Citrus-C Mask &amp; Daily Moisturizer,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love the light lemon smell of this moisturizer! It’s very smooth and applies nicely to the skin. Love the pretty packaging as well.
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Pretty good moisturizer!! Feels good on the skin!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product is pretty good! Smells nice and citrusy and feels good on the skin. It’s a bit thick so a little goes a long way. I find you need to wait a bit before applying makeup since it’s a tad greasy, but it does dry down. I prefer to use it as a mask or thicker moisturizer at night time, but it does work for both. It feels quite luxurious and I’ve been enjoying using it!"
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Lemon cupcake scent,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I've been using this at night just before I go to bed for just over a week. The whippy, luxurious texture leaves my face feeling soft especially in my dry winter apartment. Cream absorbs fast! I am not a fan of the sweet lemony cupcake scent but it's not a deal breaker."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Loved the product and its results,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It is dream for winter skin. i totally loved it. it makes my skin smooth and soft. If i compare to the moisturizer i had earlier it doesn’t moisture my skin in this canadian winters. It acted like a saviour. I have been using it for a week now and loving the after affects. I would recommend it to everyone to atlease try once.the scent is also just amazing . Loved loved loved the product and its results.
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Great overnight moisturizer,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I like this moisturizer to use at night. Nice consistency. I recommend just using it as 5 mask; there is no need to wipe off after applying. Definitely recommend. Will look into other sinkcare items from this brand.
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Loved it,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I was a bit hesitant with this moisturizer but it really surprised me, it has a lovely fragrance and works so well for my skin, I have dry skin and it helped keep me moisturized."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,A good sleep mask for refreshed skin,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product is more effective when used as a night sleeping mask since it gets absorbed by skin overnight thus making it soft and glowing.
I used this as a primer for which it preps my skin into a smooth base. Overall, it has good benefits but the only con is its price.
I would get a similar product at drugstore which provides similar effects for less bucks.
But for people who believe in branded products and vegan ingredients, I guess this would suit you.."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Hello  All....I received this product to test from my buzz agent. When I saw the product I was shocked at how big it was...60mls. A little goes a long way when you apply it to your face. It automatically feels silky and soft but absorbs fast !! For my experience with it, is that my skin went red and blotchy as soon as I applied the product. But it soon decipated and my skin went back to normal. Trying to find a good moisturizer in the Winter is hard but I think this was a home run in that department!!"
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Holy Grail for Dry Sensitive Skin,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I absolutely love this moisturizer and finally have the glowing skin I’ve been trying to achieve for years! I have dry, sensitive and have struggled to find a moisturizer that helps with dry skin without breaking me out in whiteheads. I used this moisturizer twice a day in conjunction with salicylic acid cleaner from The Inkey List and noticed smoother, brighter and more even skin within a couple of days. And no more whiteheads or dry skin patches! After a few weeks it has made my skin sooo supple and it looks the best it ever has in my life. I wear makeup daily and use it as a moisturizing primer which makes my makeup settle very nicely. I personally love it’s thick consistency and slightly lemony smell. I’ve tried moisturizers from Cerave, The Ordinary, First Aid Beauty, Tatch, Glow Recipe and Tarte unsuccessfully. I did receive this product free in return for my honest opinion which I’m super thankful for because I’m not sure I would have tried it otherwise due to the price unless I received a free sample down the line or something. That being said I will definitely repurchase for life because I have been hunting for a moisturizing this amazing for a long time so I find it worth the price. A little does go along way as I’d say I’ve only used about 1/4 of it in a month. I would definitely recommend this product to others, especially if you have dry, sensitive skin."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Smells Like Summer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product absorbed well and I loved the smell of it. Often I find face products to have overwhelming smells but this was summer to me so I loved it. It's probably going to be my new ""go to"" product as I really loved it that much. I also really loved how my skin felt after only a few days of using it. Definitely hydrated and softer feeling! I'll definitely be sharing my experience with friends and family!"
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Prefer As a Night Cream - But Does The Job Well!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Love multi use type products! This night face mask + day cream/primer fits the bill, however I prefer it as a night cream/mask over the day cream. The consistency is quite thick and although not greasy per say.. it does feel more mask like (ie. I’m aware I have product on my skin) but My God it’s so moisturizing!! I wake up, wash my face and I actually feel like I’m glowing/ my (combo) skin feels more hydrated and supple.  As a day cream/primer I did find it a little too heavy to wear under my makeup and found it made me look shiny. Very light citrusy smell, and absorbs well. 
I did feel like my face seems clearer and just more glowy too after consistent use over the week. 
I also love the compostable packaging - it looks expensive and yet is still environmentally friendly. Very cool. I’d buy this again."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nudestix Citrus-C Mask &amp; Daily Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this as a free sample in the mail and love it. I'm a huge skincare person and always looking for something that works for me super dry skin. This smells nice, is creamy, doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. It keeps the dryness away the entire day and makes my skin glow."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Fantastic Hydration,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This came in the mail as a free sample at the PERFECT time! It's been snowing, cold and dry in Toronto and my skin was not happy with my current moisturizer. Enter this beauty! It's rich and creamy but absorbs so quickly and doesn't leave my face a sweaty mess. My skin is hydrated, and it doesn't break me out. Its great in the day under makeup, or on it's own and I like to put it on extra thick at night. Will definitely buy!"
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nudestix Citrus-C Mask &amp; Daily Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I absolutely loved this moisturizer! I received this as a free sample and I’ve been using it for the last 2 weeks. I see a huge difference in my skin. My skin is glowing and feels so smooth! I love that it contains vitamin c, tumeric extract and yuzu oil. This moisturizer applies really nicely-very smooth and lightweight with a very nice scent. I will definitely be buying this moisturizer when I finish this bottle."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nudestix Citrus-C Mask &amp; Daily Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The moisturizer has a light citrus scent and is not too heavy for my combination skin. Although the packaging is not that nice, there is a lot of product and is easy to squeeze it out. This leaves my skin hydrated, but it does not leave my skin feeling oily. Very good for under make up."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Great cream for harsh winter,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have really dry reactive and sensitive skin with rosacea and I had no reaction to this cream which is rare and nice! The smell is pleasant like light citrus. I loved it as a night mask it really hydrated my skin and left it soft and smooth for the morning. I removed a star because it was a little too heavy on my skin as a morning cream I personally prefer gel creams with hyaluronic acid for daytime skincare. For the price you get a great amount of products because a little can go a long way if you apply thin layer for hydration and even if you use it as a mask you only need two pea size amount for your whole face. My face is a trainwreck in winter time and so far it helped me out.
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,A moisturizer that improves my complexion!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The Nudestix Nudeskin Citrus-C Mask and Daily Moisturizer is a dream for my dry winter skin. It has a rich, creamy consistency that absorbs beautifully into the skin. I was afraid that the richer texture might feel heavy, but even after applying a bit too much during my first application, the Citrus-C Moisturizer felt very light on my skin. I love the dewy glow it gives my skin - it doesn't look at all greasy. 

I have been using this product for over a week now, and I have already noticed some significant improvements. My skin feels velvety soft and a lot smoother. My face looks much brighter, and my overall complexion has become more even. This makes perfect sense, since the Nudeskin Citrus-C Mask and Moisturizer contains Yuzu Oil, which is known to have brightening properties, and turmeric, which aids in the reduction of the appearance of blemishes. The product does have a bit of an earthy, peppery scent to it - but it is nothing like perfume. The smell does dissipate pretty quickly, however. I will continue to use this moisturizer, as I am really enjoying all of the benefits and changes I am seeing in my face."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,A Smoothie for your face,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) In full honesty, I begin to judge products by their packaging and I loved the sleek tropical look of this moisturizer. Overall, it was a good moisturizer. The Yuzu, vitamin C and turmeric advertised on the package made me feel like I was putting a smoothie on my face ;) It did leave my face feeling fine so I'll take that."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Pretty good!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product complimentary. I’ve been using this moisturizer for a couple weeks. It’s actually very nice. I like the smell it’s not over powering at all. It almost smells sweet. The texture is nice especially if you’re a dryer skin type. I do have to let it soak in a bit before I put my make up on but make up applies nice.
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nudestix Citrus-C Mask &amp; Daily Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is the best moisturizer I have used. It smells great is very moisturizing and left my skin looking smooth, hydrated and younger. The ingredients are really good and the plastic packaging the tube came in is actually biodegradable."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nudestix Citrus-C Mask &amp; Daily Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a great moisturizer. Gentle on my skin, absorbs into my skin really nicely and smells nice. I like that the smell is gentle. I use it twice, in the morning and at night. My skin is looking plump and refreshed. I will continue to use it until it finishes to see the long term results. Happy with it so far."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Smooth and glowing,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love the product and it’s color. I always used turmeric on my skin for the fact how glowing my skin looks with it. Its a great product with vitamin c.
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Great night cream,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Such a lovely cream! The scent is so unique, but very pretty and it doesn't linger. It doesn't burn or sting. I only wear it at night, so can't comment on wearing it under makeup. But I can say that when I slather this on at night, my skin is so soft and dewy when I cleanse in the morning. I have noticed some redness has gone down, especially around my nose. The only reason why I give it 4 stars not 5 is the price. I received this from Bzz Agent to try free and as much as I like it, it's just too expensive to repurchase."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Great clean moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Love this moisturizer. It is a lovely texture, and absorbs nicely into the skin without leaving a tacky residue. It has a very subtle scent, not too strong but really nice. I would buy the other products they make. I like that the ingredients are clean and how my face feels after using it for almost a month."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nudestix Citrus-C Mask &amp; Daily Moisturizer,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I’ve been using this product for about a week now and I’ve noticed a difference in my skin! My skin appears to have a nice glow and it is incredibly smooth! The scent is not overwhelming at all which I was previously concerned about! It’s a bit pricey but we’ll worth it considering it can be used as a mask or lotion! Will definitely be buying this product in the future and would recommend to others! It’s also a bit thick in consistency so a little goes a long way!
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Healthy looking skin? Yes please.,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have been trying this product for a few weeks now and I must say it is one of my absolute favourites. It leaves my skin so silky and shiny looking while also making it smooth to the touch. My skin has never looked better! The smell of it isn't too strong but still is very nice. I have quite sensitive skin and this stuff doesn't irritate it at all, which is awesome. It is very hard to find products suited towards sensitivity. I use it daily, and nightly. I also put it in the mini fridge I have which helps with my rosacea when I put it on. I would recommend this to anyone honestly! Not one bad thing to say about it."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Smooth and Citrusy,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have somewhat dry-normal skin type. I usually prefer very mildly scented and hydrating moisturizers for my skin. Firstly, I was really interested in the ingredients of this product as Vitamin C and turmeric are known for their brightening properties. The first time I applied this moisturizer, I did notice an instant glow. The moisturizer is on the thicker side, a little goes a long way! When you apply it your skin may appear oily at first but its gets absorbed and gives you a nice plump moisturized glow. I also tried It as an evening moisturizing mask and my skin looked soothed and rested the next day. I noticed it made my makeup last all day as well and just realized it is also a makeup primer! It also has a very soft and pleasant citrusy scent. I definitely see myself purchasing  this product again. You will not regret buying this product."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Lovely overnight mask!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I’ve thoroughly enjoyed testing this product out and will definitely repurchase! I have dry, sensitive skin so I tend to avoid scented products, though I didn’t have any breakouts or reactions to this moisturizer. It’s got a lovely, lightly herbal and citrusy scent that doesn’t linger. Consistency is somewhat thick, though it absorbs beautifully. I did notice a brightening effect after using this as an overnight masque for a couple of weeks as well as waking with a plump and hydrated complexion. 
Also, can we talk about the packaging being 100% biodegradable?! Love this!"
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nice consistency and smell.,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I've used this moisturizer for 2 weeks now everyday after cleansing my face in the morning and before bedtime. I was a bit worried that the turmeric might make my skin yellow but its lower on the ingredients list so it could be used to colorize the cream. The consistency of the cream is good, not to runny or thick and it was used during the wintertime and was enough to keep my face from drying. It does not have a residue that some thicker moisturizers might have. It did not lighten some of the brown spots I had but I have yet to find a cream that does. I like that it's in a tube and stays fresh longer. The smell of the product is a mix of herbal medicine and lime and a bit of hemp but I like it. It's not overpowering."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Awesome!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I loved getting the chance to try out this daily moisturizer from bzzagent.  It's been working wonders on my skin so far.  It has a light scent which I enjoy compared to other moisturizers I've used in the past.  I find it works very well for a night mask too.  I wake up looking and feeling moisturized and dewy.  It also never hurts to have vegan ingredients such as yuzu and tumeric.
I'm going to have to repurchase when I run out of this tube and I definitely recommend it to all my friends."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Powerful and light moisturizer.,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) A little goes a long way with this powerful moisturizer. It goes on thick but feels light and not at all greasy. Citrus-C feels wonderful on my dry winter skin, leaving it feeling moisturized and happy. The scent is not too powerful or overwhelming, which is lovely for my sensitive skin. This is now a regular staple in my everyday routine."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Perfect Morning/Night Cream,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Really enjoy this moisturizer. A little goes a long way despite the thicker consistency and the light citrus smell is not overwhelming.This is an ideal moisturizer for normal to dry skin and leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated. Also worth noting after applying and allow the moisturizer to absorb into the skin it does initiatlly have a tacky feeling which acts well as a primer under makeup.
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,A little goes a long way!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This moisturizer appears thick at first but goes on in a smooth thin layer - perfect for my daily use and to build as a mask at night for glowy, soft skin in the morning. I can’t recommend this product enough as it really helped hydrate my dry, winter skin all day without any greasy feel or breakouts! Honestly, this could really work with any skin type. I love that it has a brightening effect on my skin as well. The scent is amazing, almost citrusy and a bit spicy but disappears very quickly so it’s also great for those who like non scented products. A little goes a long way, so this product will last quite a while!"
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Nudestix Citrus-C Mask &amp; Daily Moisturizer,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) As far as moisturizers go, the NUDESKIN Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer is a strong contender as a daily staple in the beauty drawer. With a creamy, soft texture and a lack of oily residue, it works just as well under makeup as it does as a face mask for when you need a little extra hydration. 

It absorbs well into the skin without leaving behind grease. With a vegan-friendly ingredients, including turmeric and yuzu, I find it does a rather good job in increasing skin uniformity and decreasing redness where slight blemishes are concerned, helping to remove marks faster. There is a slight scent of yuzu, similar to a lemon smell, so those with scent sensitivities should take this into consideration.

Overall, it was pleasant to wake up in the morning and feel my facial skin being incredibly silky. I appreciate that softness in skin texture, as it helps to plump up fine lines and gives a youthful appearance to the skin."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Smells Great but feels greasy,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product to test. The pros: The product smells amazing! I love the scent and really wakes me up after I put it on. The yuzu really comes through. The product also very moisturizing. I have dry skin and it does work well. The con: I found the texture of the product to be really greasy. Once I had it on, it looked oily and did not sink into the skin as well as I had hoped. I like a dewy skin but when i tried to use it under make up it just made my skin too shiny and looked oily. It actually was starting to break up my make up even though it was recommended to be used under make up. 
My suggestion, this product should be used on it own and given time to sink into the skin properly before doing anything else. If not it just becomes too shiny."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Essential product,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This moisturizer is now part in my everyday skin routine and will forever be. It’s the perfect consistency, rush, smooth, thick and smells very fresh. The only fragranced product I can use in my sensitive skin."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Very rich and luxurious moisturizer!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have combination skin so I'm usually oily in the T-zone, while the other parts of my face are insanely dry. When I first applied this moisturizer, I loved the feel of it as it came out of the tube as it was very rich and thick yet absorbed immediately without leaving me looking greasy. My hands (which have been so dry and cracked due to using hand sanitizer so much) also benefitted from this moisturizer. I could see and feel that my hands were so much more hydrated and moisturized after just applying the cream to my face after the first time! I can see some people perhaps not being crazy about the Turmeric scent, but find the citrusy scent of the Yuzu generally overpowers the Turmeric and I rather enjoy the scent. This is a great moisturizer that I will continue to use and will recommend to friends!"
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,"Smooth cream, great scent","(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product to try for free in exchange for an honest review.
I used the product for a week as directed and did notice that my skin was well moisturized and looked bright. You definitely do not need to use much for day time use as the cream is thick and spreads very easily (kind of like butter but without the greasy feel). It goes on smooth. At night, I used twice as much as a sleeping mask. The product smells great and is rejuvenating in the morning.
I don’t like that it doesn’t have anti-aging properties and for that reason will use it more as a sleeping mask a couple of times a week and an “ai didn’t sleep well last night” day cream rather than a daily moisturizer."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,GREAT DAILY MOISTURIZER,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product is great I have been using it twice daily and it gives lots of hydration to the skin! It feels nice under makeup as well and lasts all day making the skin feel refreshed! I use it at night and sleep with it all night as a mask and it works wonders! I would recommend this product for all skin types but especially combo to dry skin! I will be purchasing it once this one is empty, it is an essential of my skincare routine now!"
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Great product,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I been using this product for the past 2 weeks and can say that my skin felt soft, refreshed, bright and evened out my skin tone. I use it twice a week and seen changes to my skin. I do however think the scent is a bit strong for my liking. I prefer my skincare products to be a bit lightly scented. I would recommend others to try, because it is a great product."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Great product!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) How does this product compare to other products you’ve tried?
It works instantly and you are left with an immediate glow to your skin! My skin was moisturized for the whole day. The effects last long.

What are some benefits of owning this product?
I love the texture. Not sticky and doesn't leave any residue. 

Would you buy this product?
Yes, of course!

Would you recommend this product to your friends or family?
Yes. I think it's great for all skin types."
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,"Great smelling product, but not for me","(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) My skin is pretty dry in the winter so I was pretty excited to try this product. Packing was great and the smell of the product was very pleasant, however I was a little skeptic all considering I have sensitive skin and unfortunately, this product didn’t work for me. Despite the pleasant smell and creamy consistency after using this for just over a week, my skin couldn’t take it anymore. My chin and cheeks got very oily causing acne to form. After a while I stopped applying the product for a few days and my skin cleared up. 

Hopefully this works for someone else, but unfortunately not for me :("
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Definitely a nice add to the routine,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It made my skin feel noticeably softer after a week of use glad i decided to try this product the only suggestion i may have is the scent is strong for those with sensitive skin
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,Amazing,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I was having the worst hormonal break out and so when I was offered this to try I was sceptical if this would help or make things worst! My gawd this stuff is amazing! Not only did it clear up my face but also it evened my skin tone and any red pigmentation from prev acne break outs were gone!!! Smells amazing like lemon orange but light enough it doesn’t bother you and a little bit goes a long way. I did find it to be a tad bit drying which is saying something because I have oily skin but that’s why I liked it. If you already have dry skin it may not be the best for you
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Singapore,Amazing,"First I got it as a free sample and when I tried for weeks - it works well for my sensitive skin. Smell nice and it’s not like those kind of sticky moisturer, it applies well into your skin. "
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Australia,Great all round moisturiser ,"This is great. I have oily skin, and this product is both light on the skin and hydrating. You can build it up depending on your skin type. It works nicely as a primer. It has some nice skincare benefits, as is the norm for Nudestix. "
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Singapore,awesome ,I have oily combination skin. Definitely LEaves a shiny glow to my face but does not irritate my sensitive skin at all love it so much highly recommended 
NUDESTIX-Citrus-C Mask & Daily Moisturizer,Canada,"Amazing moisturizer, on my third tube","I'm on my third tube of this moisturizer. It is an amazing texture, it smells fantastic, and it makes my combination skin feel really good. It is good to us all year around. I don't use it as a bedtime moisturizer, I use it only as a daytime. It sits well under makeup and it is not greasy at all. I just wish they made it in a bigger tube! I feel like you can go through this quickly. It is however a standard moisturizer amount, it just comes in a tube instead. Nudestix please make thing in a bigger tube as an option! ❤️"
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Cooling Aqua Jelly,Canada,Dermalogica Clear Start Cooling Aqua Jelly,I got this moisturizer in a rewards bazaar gift set and I’ve used it a couple times and so far I am liking it! I don’t find the scent to be strong at all. I find this dries on my skin quite nicely and my forehead is not oily by mid day. I pair this with the micro pore mist and the two seem to work great together!
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Cooling Aqua Jelly,Malaysia,LOVE THIS,I store this in the fridge and it gives off a great cooling effect upon application. Love using this before workouts too. Defo will repurchase in the future. 
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Cooling Aqua Jelly,Canada,PERFUME TOO STRONG,"Overall, the moisturizer is not bad. I dont like the fragrance which is strong and you can smell it all day long. It is kind of annoying."
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Cooling Aqua Jelly,Singapore,Smells like Baygon bug killer,"This smells awful for the price. It is the distinct odour of insecticide spray we use at home and makes me gag. While it works well as a lightweight moisturiser to control sebum, the strong scent is why I would not repurchase.
"
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Cooling Aqua Jelly,Singapore,Love it!,"It smells amazing, like an intense bouquet of roses. Might not be everyone's cup of tea but I like the added aromatherapy. The product itself doesn't cause me any pimples etc even though there is quite a bit of oils in the product. Lovely for sensitive skin days. 100% will repurchase."
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Cooling Aqua Jelly,Singapore,great for oily skin,Purchased this after seeing a couple of influencer reviews and this is truly a great moisturiser for those with oily skin. Really fuss free and easy to slap on for lazy days! However the fragrance can be a little strong so if you’re picky about scents this might not be suitable for you. 
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Cooling Aqua Jelly,Malaysia,Not bad at all.. ,I do like this - it’s enough to moisture my face and calms heated skin during the day. This is not bad at all for oily skin. Minus one star as I wish the price could be cheaper. 
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Malaysia,Good,"It is a good product, Function very well for me to reduce eye wrinkles, use each evening as part of my night-time skincare routine, waking up to a younger looking and radiant skin, recommended "
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Not for sensitive skin.,"I have very dry and sensitive undereyes and no matter what I do, this eye cream eventually irritates my skin. I've tried introducing it once a week for a few months, always over moisturizer but it still causes the under eye area to get dry and patchy."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Malaysia,Just an eyecream,Not sure me or anyone else. But this eyecream literally don't do anything to my undereye. Even my dah cirle also didn't remove even after 4 weeks of usage. Definitely will not purchase again
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Save Your Money for Better Products,I really wanted to love this product but I can’t. I’ve been using this product for 3 months and I’ve seen no difference at all. It does nothing for fine lines and wrinkles.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Malaysia,Ms,"It's really good and hydrating but it does not go well under makeup, it makes my makeup look cakey. I would recommend to buy this only if you want to use it for your night skin care only. Other than that, I love how it makes my skin feel,"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,No change,"After using this product for months, I saw no change and gave up. Got a sample of a different eye cream from Sephora and saw improvement within a week."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,Didn’t see any change . I didn’t use it consistently though. I suggest to do more research on what to purchase.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,It’s q good product… it’s very soft and mustoiring,My favorite product right now it’s very soft and good
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Affordable retinol!,"This cream is a staple in my skincare routine! I haven't noticed significant differences, but I have noticed I don't get as many defined fine lines and wrinkles under my eyes."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,good product,lifted my eyes and make small first wrinkles less visible. both photos I took smiling and wear same makeup as usual so I can see the good difference in eye bags and lines.( before glasses after withouth.) easy to use and makes me feel more confident
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,A must have!,"4th repurchase! I’m 20 and started noticing some aging around my eyes so I purchased this, it’s been a holy grail. Those signs of aging have disappeared. Super easy to use, doesn’t sting my eyes. 10/10"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,"I can’t believe how well this works. I use it as a preventative measure because I  have noticed dark circles around my eyes and when I smile I can see crows feet starting  to form and what they will look like in years to come. Ive used this twice and this completely smoothes out my under eye lid, no smile lines or dark circles. In the past I used the Kiehls Retinol serum under my eyes which also did this but its much more expensive. Glad I found this. Ive had retinol burn a few times so Im careful with what I use and I had no irritation with this product. 

I am exicted to see how this affects my skin two months from now."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,didn’t work,Haven’t noticed to much of difference might not be the right product for me
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,such an affordable retinol product. i can’t comment on the effectiveness as I use the product for preventative care
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,Nice firming eye cream at a really nice price point! Love all The Inkey List products so far!
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Give it a shot!,"I've tried many eye creams and this one is my latest purchase.
I have been using it for a little over a month and did notice that my fine lines reduced in size.  The makeup application of my concealer is also smoother.
I do apply it only at night.  I take about a pea-size amount, even smaller, and it is enough to apply it around my eyes, the 11s, some frown lines on my forehead and the lines that are near the nose & mouth.  Afterwards, I apply my Tarte Drink of H2O moisturizer.  My skin can tolerate retinol & hyaluronic acid together. But if you are new to using retinol, do not mix it with hyaluronic acid as it can cause irritation to the skin.
Also, please do not forget to apply SPF when using this product as it can have an adverse effect with the sun's rays and cause irritability. 
I went away to the south for one week and stopped using it a week before my departure date.
So far, I'm very pleased with this product and will intend to repurchase once this tube is used up."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,it actually works,"I was so skeptical at first because of the price, but seriously within 1 month of using this every night I noticed a big difference, I’m so happy with this product and the outcome"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Incredible,"i didn’t think a product could surprise me given how many i’ve tried and abandoned, but in less than two weeks the difference i’ve seen with this product is incredible. i’m 50, with relatively light creasing at the corners of my eyes, and it’s reduced the lines dramatically. i’ve had no irritation or peeling either and i use it nightly. i do put a regular eye cream over top once it absorbs. highly recommend."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,INCREDIBLE,AMAZING! I’ve been using it for a while now and the makeup under my eyes looks SO GOOD!
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,Worked really well to soften fine lines around my under eyes after using every night for a few weeks
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,great,"Works great on my fine lines, easy to use and inexpensive"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Highly recommend it..,Eye cream that actually works for dark circles. Very affordable and great product. I have tried many eye creams for dark circles but nothing beats it. I highly recommend it
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,correct,Je suis mitigé je ne vois pas vraiment d'amélioration mais ça hydrate
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Good Budget Friendly Eye Cream,"For the price, I enjoy this eye cream. It does the job and this packaging makes so much sense to me!! Good job Inkey List."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,"I’m giving this five stars because it’s one of the only eye creams that doesn’t burn/irritate my eyes. I have extremely sensitive eyes and most eye creams or retinol eye creams especially are super irritating. So the fact that I can use this means I like it. In terms of effectiveness: hard to tell. I know retinol is not an overnight fix kind of ingredient, it’s more of a long haul/marathon thing you have to commit to."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,"I use it on my eyes at night 3/4 times a week and my eye puffiness has improved and colouration. I can’t be sure if it’s this product as I use many, but it’s definitely not increasing my wrinkles."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Bye bye undereyes,Been using about 3 times a week for the past month and my undereyes are very noticeably less sunken in and dark. Also my makeup sits a lot nicer under my eyes since I started using this as my nighttime eye cream. Warning - it is not very hydrating so I top with a facial oil when I put it on!
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Doesn’t absorb at all..,"Not a fan at all.  It doesn’t absorb at all, just sits on top of the skin and eventually pills off.  Kinda gross to be honest. Big no from me."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,I'M IN LOVE,"Wow Wow Wow, I'm in LOVE!!! I already saw a difference after 1 week! I'm definitely going to rebuy it!!!"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Removed milia,Helped remove my milia those little annoying white bumps around my eyes. My skin is sensitive and I had no bad reactions or dryness
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,"Absolutely love this! Very soft and moisturizing, love the tube and simple packaging and honestly, you can’t beat the price. I have quite sensitive skin and I haven’t had any issues (been using nightly for about a month now). I would highly recommend."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,"I visibly saw a change after a couple of weeks. The harsh lines around my eyes lessened. I like the consistency of the product and it’s also easy to apply around the eye area. If I see even more progress than I have right now, I’d definitely buy this eye cream again."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,Blends easily into eye area.  Seems to be fine on my mature skin.  A good value purchase.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,not bad but there is better out there,I have used this product for about more than two months now it works just okay nothing major  for reducing signs of ageing but I am using this as more of a preventive measure as I do not suffer from drastic signs of ageing and I am just trying too keep them at bay as long as possible
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,I myself haven’t really noticed any changes but have received 2 (SUPER RANDOM) compliments about my skin around my eyes LOL.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Yes and no!,I started using it because I noticed my eye area felt tight and dry. Didn’t help considerably with moisturizing however did lighten my dark circles noticeably. For fading dark circles yes but no as a moisturizing eye cream.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,Good eye cream but I didn’t like the consistency. It breaks apart when it comes out of the tube
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,I haven’t used it enough but it stings my eyes sometimes… hoping it works though
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,No definitive conclusion,"I started using this over a month ago and I don't see any noticeable changes. Considering I am using it as a preventative rather than a treatment, I would say it does its job. The only thing I don't like about it is the amount of wasted product. No matter how much you squish, squeeze, and shake, a weird oil always comes out when you squeeze it."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Made the eye feel weird,I was excited to try this out after seeing a dermatologist review this on YouTube. This however didn’t work for me. One of eyes seemed to have a hard time opening and closing. Like it drooped the lid or something. I thought it was just me but when my mum tried she also felt like something was making the eyes feel weird. I tried it after a while just to make sure it’s this and then again the next day the same eye felt weird.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Reducing milia,I’ve struggled with milia on my eye lids for a while and this has been causing them to come to the surface and go away with AMAZING speed. Obviously having the milia surface is a bit unsightly but they’re going away and not coming back. Really great product at a great price.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,LOVE! Price is amazing and great results so far,"I looked at many other retinol eye products before trying this one after an employee recommended The Inkey List ‘Retinol Eye Cream’. The price point is a no brainer if you are in the market for a good eye cream and I also love that it is a clean beauty brand. I waited about a month after trying this product to write this review and I can happily say that my under eye wrinkles and texture have already improved in the short time I’ve been using this product. The consistency is almost like a oily, liquid texture and I warm it up between my fingers and it creates a smooth cream that is easy to apply (doesn’t tug! So important!) I am so excited to see the results after a few months of using this product and am amazed at how fast I’ve seen results already. Remember to use a good SPF always in the day (don’t forget those eyelids!). Highly, highly recommend this product. 
P.S. My first post didn’t work so I rewrote this review. It’s THAT GOOD."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,so good for this price,I really like this eye cream. It keeps my asking under the eyes so hydrated.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Great First Impressions!,"I really enjoy this eye cream so far. I have sensitive eyes/skin and it hasn't caused any irritation or redness thus far. It is very hydrating and it applies smoothly. I have only been using this for a short time, so I will continue to use this regularly to see if the fine lines around my eyes improve."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Try it !,"My first retinol eye cream. I liked it, it's not irriating my skin (but I'm not using it every day). A little bit goes a long way and it's a good price to try retinol."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Decent but separates within the tube :/,"this is a decent eye cream (hydrating and not too sensitizing) but after a few weeks the cream started to separate inside the tube, so whenever I squeezed some out i would get a thin watery liquid and some thicker cream and it just doesnt feel the same. It worked alright for the first few weeks but isnt life changing or anything, it was worth a shot because of the excellent price point but its just not a nice user experience."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Improved skin texture around eyes,"Works in some way. I have noticed the skin around my eyes is smoother. Less texture. Might be helpful with fine lines, but I'm 29 so I don't have many fine lines anyways and hence not one comment about the product's performance for that. I like that its more affordable than other eye creams, easy to work with, you don't need much. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I barely use a teeny tiny amount every night. Its fragrance free, which is awesome. If you want to buy an eye cream, definitely try this one out. At least if it doesn't work, you won't have spent too much."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Not good for sensitive skin,"I'm 90% sure this product gave me some reaction around my eyes as it's the only change I had in routine and then have had a bad reaction for a couple of days. Normally I would love to rate this brand high given price point, but I am certain its not for ultra-sensitive skiin like mine."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Good for sensitive skin,"Bought this for my mom who has very sensitive skin and she’s loving it. She’s finding it hydrating and soothing, and it hasn’t irritated her rosacea. She’s been using this for two weeks now and so far nothing noticeable anti-aging wise, but I think that will take more time."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,Feels good under my eyes moisturizing without being greasy
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Yaas,Have repurchased a few times. Great retinol product for the price.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Not the Best Choice for Dry Skin,"It is moisturizing and it's light, and cheap. All good things. It just isn't right for my skin which is super dry. But I still use it sometimes. I just have to use more."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,"I bought this product to combat the little wrinkles around my eyes, but it’s ended up doing SO much more.

I’ve only used it for 3 days, and my dark circles have almost completely disappeared and my little wrinkles already look better.

Very happy with both the efficacy and the price point. Highly recommended!"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,So far so good,"Haven't been using it for very long, but I have already noticed that in the morning when I wake up, the fine lines under my eyes are not as bad as they used to be. I am sure I just need to take it slow and stay consistent and I will see even more results."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,This is not a product for dark circles!!!,"I’m reading a lot of reviews saying this did nothing for their dark circles, and that’s because this eye cream helps to reduce aging lines under the eyes! For me, it did exactly that in such a quick amount of time. The skin under my eyes was getting dryer and “older” looking and this cream came to the rescue! For dark circles, you need a brightening under eye cream! This cream helps my eyes lay nice and flat and texturally blend in with the rest of my skin."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Waste of money,The worst eyecream I've tried so far. Maybe for hydratation but not good at all for dark cercles. I've tried some of drugstore's brand and I saw better results.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,Not worth your money at all. Its ok for hydrating.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,This is a must have from now on. I see a significant difference with this! I have to have this from now on!
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,I bought this in early August and it’s now early September and all I can say is that when I apply it I can see that my under eye skin looks a little less wrinkly but over all I still don’t see a big change.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,I haven't seen a huge difference in the fine lines around my eyes but it is hydrating and can't be beat for the price!
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Worth the money,"Excellent product, I noticed a visible improvement after about 3 days of use. I didn't have any adverse reaction to the retinol (sometimes retinol makes your skin red and flaky until it gets used to it). I was a little concerned about the size at first but 15ml is plenty. This was my first retinol product and I've had a great experience with it!"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,"I had to give it 4 stars because it works, but it intensely dried out my skin. I'm not sure it's worth the compromise. I likely wouldn't buy again, unless in a pinch."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,meh.,"It’s ok. Nothing to write home (or here) about, really. I know you have to be consistent and I was and didn’t see a ton of difference. Perhaps just not the product for me."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Decent,I got this primarily to help with milia and as a preventative product as I get into my 30’s. I can’t speak to effectiveness for fine lines as I do not yet have any around my eyes but it absolutely eliminated a couple milia I had that were not going away on their own. So I’m happy with it especially for the price.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Nothing Special,Just a regular eye cream. I’d be surprised if it had retinol at all. Consistency is a little clumpy coming out.  If you just want a regular eye cream that’s cheap buy it but for anyone looking for a real retinol cream you’ll need to pay more to see results.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,"aide à diminuer mes ridules, en la combinant à ma crème à l'avocat de Khiels mes yeux ont l'air vraiment plus réveillés."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,"Works soo well I can definitely see a difference in my fine lines!

Do be patient tho! Especially if it is your first time using retinol products. At first it can be dry and burn so use little doses and take breaks from it if needed. But if you are persistent the results will show!!"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Doesn't do too much,"I do not really see a difference, its been a month plus. No fragrance and is a nice texture but no positive changes. Great Value price though"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,"PROS: very moisturizing, does not irritate or sting eyes, low price
CONS: none"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,This was the only new product I added to my night time routine. Since using it my under eyes have been so dry and flakey. I’m not going to continue to use it…
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Works for me.,"This is definitely doing something. The sun damage dark spots on my face are slowly fading. (I put some on the back of my hands and the spots there are fading, too! Hooray!)"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,Light weight oily type cream. Went on smoothly. I experienced some irritation at the beginning and my under eyes would sting so bad. Took a break from using it and when I went back I didn't experience any irritation. I didn't see an improvement of my dark under eyes.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,"Good for mouth, not eyes","I really like this for around my mouth at night. I found it a bit drying around my eyes, so am keeping my Kate Sommerville regime (although I really wanted this to work, as it is so much cheaper)!"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Does the job,I'm not a huge fan of the texture BUT I feel it does work. I noticed a difference over time and would definitely repurchase for the price.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Good nightime eyecream,"Good nightime eyecream, your undereye may be slightly sensitive but get better with continued use. I did see a slight difference after my first use and believe that there is change happening but it takes time."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,I recently started noticing fine lines around my eyes. This product was recommended to me by a friend and I am glad because it’s a great product. Apart from fine lines it is also good for reducing puffiness around the eye. I like the texture and the feel of the product too. It is so light. I’d give it a 10/10.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,"So far so good. I’ve been using it for about a month and it has slowly but surely improved the fine lines around my eyes, and I’m 40. 
Important reminder to folks, you must follow this up with a moisturizer on top to seal it in, otherwise you won’t see the benefits. I found this out the hard way and was getting super dried out at first. But once I started adding a moisturizer on top (cerave night renewing cream), it made all the difference."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,It’s good!,"Doesn’t irritate the eye, good price point. Haven’t notice major changes to my eye area yet but I will probably repurchase again to give it a fair shot, the price is so reasonable I’m ok to try another bottle."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,"Not bad, not too good","Good, but not anymore than any other moisturizing eye cream. I thought the retinol would give a more dramatic result.  Maybe I need something stronger."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,amazing price point and it works!,Gentle for under the eyes. I have been using for three weeks now and see a difference in the fine lines under my eyes when I smile. I also find my under eye concealer goes on better and doesn’t crease. I am using this at night in conjunction with the under eye brighter in the morning. The price point is awesome and just ordered some for my mom too.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Start slow and stay consistent! IT WORKS!,"I've used prescription tretinoin for several years so I knew the benefit of retinoid but was uncertain about OTC retional. But all of those concerns vanished because wowww is this ever the real deal! These pictures were taken four months apart (note I'm smiling in both to ""show"" the fine lines). I started using it 4 to 5 times a week and found that was too much (I experienced redness and irritation) so I cut it down to 2 to 3 three times a week. After about two months, I had built up a better tolerance and have since used it consistently 4 times a week. I'd say I started noticing some results after 3 months but now I'm really getting the wow factor. Side note I'm 31 so while I wasn't necessarily showing extreme signs of aging, the fine lines were definitely showing up. All I can say is start slow but stick with it! The results will come with consistency."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,worth it,"I started using this product a month ago.
let's see. Good price and seems worth it."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Not for me,"The lines around my eyes aren't terrible.. but after using this product for a couple of months I think it actually made them worse. I'm mixing a little in with my nighttime moisturizer now just to use it up (since there is retinol in it), but won't repurchase and can't recommend. I gave one star for the cost (its very affordable) and the fact it is unscented."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,I love this night eye cream. I often find I get puffy undereyes in the morning but I don’t anymore when I use this. It’s super comfortable and doesn’t irritate my skin.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Great retinol eye cream,"Honestly I only bought this eye cream because of the retinol and mostly because the great price. I like the tube it comes in. For me it is really moisturizing. I am in my early 50s so my eyes need some help, although mother nature helped me a lot. I don't have big wrinkles, but if I lough they come out. I can't say this cream made them disappear, still my skin around the eyes has improved, a little. I use this almost every day, morning and evening. With the Covid lock out, I don't need much sun screen. All in all I love it and I'll buy a new one when I finish the tube."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,amazing,"This does exactly as advertised! Makes you’re eyes look younger!! I love this and can’t believe the price
This tube lasted 3 months for me now buying my second"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Great price for a great product,"I purchased this product because I was looking for an eye cream formulated with retinol for the under-eye wrinkles I'm developing. This is my first retinol eye cream so I started using this once a week at night for a few weeks, then twice a week. Now I'm using it every other night when I apply another retinol product (Versed's Press Restart Gentle Retinol Serum with Bakuchiol) on the rest of my face. The biggest thing to keep in mind with retinol is that you shouldn't use it at the same time that you're exfoliating (both products can strip and dry the skin) however, because this cream is specifically for the eye area and you shouldn't be exfoliating your under eye area, you probably could use this cream everyday. It's a lightweight cream that spreads and absorbs into the skin well. I have noticed a difference in the prominence of my under eye wrinkles. I've been using this INKEY List Retinol Eye Cream as well as the First Aid Beauty Brightening Eye Cream with Niacinamide during the day. Niacinamide is another great ingredient for reducing the appearance of wrinkles so it's a good alternative for those days where I don't use retinol. One of the great things about the INKEY List is that their products have a great price point for their quality. It's also simply but effectively formulated and is fragrance free, which my dry, sensitive skin loves. I will use this product over and over again. I don't need to look for anything else."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Be aware of risks,"tl;dr: this may be too strong a retinol for people with especially thin skin under their eyes and/or who are trying to prevent wrinkles vs treat

I'm 34 years old and have just started getting fine lines around my eyes when I smile. I thought I'd use some preventative retinol.
But I'm 90% sure this product made everything WORSE. My fine lines and baby crow's feet got deeper and new lines appeared and the skin under my eyes got crepey, despite the fact that I drink lots of water and also moisturize my under-eyes. 
I've now read that sometimes retinol can make eye wrinkles worse before improving them. I'm sorry, but I'm unwilling to take that risk for months in the hopes it will get better. Now I'm having to undo the signs of aging this caused, with non-retinol products."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,crazy good price :) havent really noticed any significant change BUT imma keep trying :)
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,big results!,"I’m 40 this year for reference.  My crows feet only have one toe and it slants down from my eye lol.  I love the packaging/application of this product.  I just squeeze it right along my crows toes and let it sit for about a minute to warm up before spreading it in.  The consistency is a water cream and it spreads nicely. 

I’ve been using it for about 2 months now and I notice a big difference.  So do my friends.  This helped clear up a milia I had on one of the crows toes lol.  Ugh I can’t tell you how relieved I am about it making my crows toes go away, they were getting pretty bad and now I can even wing my eyeliner again, I couldn’t even do the old person Wonder Woman trick any more.. so yeah, big difference and I’m happy.  

Cant beat that price either.  

It is drying so when I put it on at night with my face retinol I wait a 20 mins or more then I put a collagen serum on everywhere and during the day I focus on moisturizing.  

I recommend this product on my fb groups for older ladies and other people come and agree with my recommendations so clearly we have a gem here!!"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Bye Bye Eye Wrinkles!,"Absolutely love this retinol eye cream!  It’s silky and it feels so light going on.  Been using it for 2-3 weeks now and I can see a slight difference in my eye wrinkles.  It’s enough of a difference for me
to notice and I’m impressed!  Worth the $12.99 for sure!  Honestly I would pay 10x the amount for this cream because it honestly WORKS!  I was hesitant to buy it at first- thinking I have too many eye creams already.  But I am glad I talked myself into this self care cutie!  Ugly packaging LOL I’m so sorry but I hate the boring packaging... but the cream works so I wouldn’t care if the packaging was 10x more ugly! BUY THIS RETINOL YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,"A good introduction to a retinol eye cream for me. It's very hydrating and gentle. A little product goes a long way and I love that it comes in a tube. Gives me complete control over how much product I need to dispense. I have not seen any changes in the appearance of my eyes, but I don't really have fine lines and wrinkles. As I am in my 40's, I did want to introduce retinol in my skincare routine. Overall a good product in terms of price point, package design and the level of hydration it provides to the eye area. I would purchase this again."
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Retinol Eye Cream,"Noticed my eyes looked tired.. i started using this a week ago and it kinda helps, not sure yet! But i like it a lot!"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Good for hydration.,Good a creamy texture and it is not too pily but good at hydrating the skin.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,LOVE IT,A little goes a long way! It’s the perfect creamy consistency and my under eyes are always left feeling so smooth!
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,"Be aware,It causes milia","This eyecream is horrible.I have milias under my eyes and had to book an appointment with a dermatologist to get rid of them,although nothing has happened. I thought maybe My oily skin can’t bare this eyecream and I started to use it for my bf. SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIS EYES. I’m really surprised with the reviews on this product!"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Really gentle retinol formula,"I’ve been using this product for about 6 weeks now, and I quite like it. I have never used a retinol product, so I was a bit apprehensive about using one for my eyes to start with. But it is very gentle and doesn’t irritate my skin at all. I have noticed a very slight improvement of the static/dynamic wrinkles around my eyes, specifically around the outer corners and under-eye areas.  Sometimes though, it does not spread as nicely as I’d like it too - so I try to be conscious when layering products together and to not use too much. But I will continue to buy this product and keep using it!"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,doesn’t do anything,I’ve been using for 2 months every night and noticed zero difference in the condition of my under eye wrinkles. I don’t have deep wrinkles or anything just some fine lines and thinning skin as I’m in my 30s. This didn’t do anything. Only up side is that it’s cheap for trial and error purposes.
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,I use this every night!,"I have been using this for a little over a month and really like it. I have noticed a change in crows feet when I smile. I am 31 so my wrinkles are not too defined but always good to start before it gets worse. I did get a little sensitivity while using this after about 4 times but I took a 2 day break and then continued using everyday and the sensitivity went away (I do have mildly sensitive skin). It was only sensitive when I rubbed under my eyes. This did not dry out my skin, it actually felt moisturized. I will continue using this and so happy the price is so affordable. Overall great product!"
THE INKEY LIST-Retinol Eye Cream,Canada,Drying,"Personally I purchased it because I read that retinol eye creams can help with milia bumps. I slowly introduced it and tried to use it nightly and using sunscreen in the day as recommended. It’s very drying and possible made my milia worse. I can’t say it did much more me. Made my eyes dry, the skin around my eyes dry, and didn’t help with my milia."
WEI-Royal Ming Empress Cream Moisturiser,,Expensive but worth the money!,I can really see the result after using this product. Skin tone became lighter and the even though it's a cream but it is not oily. I have tried the toner and it was great as well. I have repurchased and I hope Sephora Malaysia will bring in more products from Wei.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,AMAZING,"I’ve been using Tatcha for years. This is by far THE best moisturizer. It melts in the face and it’s really incredible, it’s hard to describe. It’s thick but doesn’t leave the face feeling weighed down or having a layer of stuff on the face. Price point is high, but worth it! If not this one, Dewy or Water cream are great as well."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Malaysia,Tatcha Silk Cream,Tatcha Silk Cream is really suitable for hot and humid Asian countries. It is a weightless gel cream and it doesnt leave a tacky or sticky feeling after application. Skin feels a lot more plump after several months of usage & would highly recommend it.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,not moisturizing enough,"i wanna start this review by saying i love tatcha, im a huge fan of the dewy skin cream and their rice polishes, i was really excited to try this product because of the amazing reviews so i went ahead and bought it, i gave this product a good try i made sure to finish the jar before writing this review, for my nightcream i like a really thick moisturizer so i use creme de la mer and that’s just an amazing night cream, however for the day time i wanted something more lightweight as i was using the dewy skin cream and that worked amazing but i wanted something lighter so i tried this,  it’s just not moisturizing enough, i like that it adsobs quickly but that’s about all it does since my skin feels dry after a few minutes and i found my self having to re apply more moisturizer which is something i never do, if you have dry skin this just simply isn’t for you, going back to the dewy skin cream for my day cream"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,"HG moisturizer (dry climate, mature/normal skin)","This is my HG cream. It is extremely moisturizing for the dry climate I live in (and I have fairly mature skin). It feels great going on - very emollient - and then is quickly absorbed by my skin, leaving a soft and silky texture, not sticky, slimy, or oily. I have tried a few products and nothing else so far comes close."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Singapore,OMG! ,The hefty price tag on this is a killer to the good vibes that this moisturiser has. The gel like texture is amazing and it really smooths things out. The hydrolysed silk also helps to even skin texture and builds skin resilience. I do mix this in with some other moisturisers and aloe gel to make this product go further to last through the night. 
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,dry skin beware!,"If you have dry skin, this isn’t for you. Not hydrating also not worth the cost."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,Super lightweight moisturizer! I use this in the morning as the last step in my skincare routine and it has me glowing an feeling really refreshed.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Malaysia,ok moisturizer,a bit sticky for my preference. did its job as a moisturizer but did not see significant changes to skin texture nor helped much with hydration. too pricey.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,Not bad but definitely not worth 124 for a jar that lasts ~ 4 months.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Don't Touch my Tatcha,"I am a huge Tatcha fan! This product didn't disappoint, it is amazing. A little goes a long way."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Works for Oily Skin,"I know that this isn't recommended for oily skin, but it worked amazing for mine! The Water Cream is my holy grail for my day moisturizer and I thought I would try this one for extra firming since it has been described as a combination of the Water Cream and Dewy Cream. I found it to be closer to the water cream in terms of texture and absorbs quickly. The Dewy cream doesn't work for my skin, but the Silk Cream sure does! I like to use it at night and wake up to super soft skin."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Singapore,worth it,"No kidding, the price is steep but it’s definitely worth it! In love with this moisturiser! Applying it makes me feel so good! My husband kept complimenting my naked face!"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,been using it 1yr+ &in love with this moisturizer,"By far one of my top 2 favorite moisturizers.  I have the silk cream, which I’ll use in the morning and use the dewy cream at night.  It’s very light but extremely moisturizing for my skin.  I have dry skin, especially in the cold, dry winters on the east coast I’ll get dry patches and my skin just screams for moisture.  I haven’t experienced dry patches like I used to since I started using moisturizers, and this one keeps my skin in check.  I love it because it goes well under makeup too.  It feels like water almost & dissolves into the skin quickly.  Whereas with the dewy cream, it takes some time to unslug & allow the skin to breathe.  I will continue to repurchase this cream and use it in the AM.  Sometimes I’ll use it in the PM too just because I love it so much!  Using it mostly 1X daily, it lasts me pretty much 3-4 months.  I switch between this & La Mer, also some other creams I want to use up so maybe it lasts me more than others using it every day, or 2x a day."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Malaysia,smooth,It’s very light and smooth. Perfect for hot days when you don’t want heavy moisturizers that make your face feels sticky.  I love most of Tatcha products!
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Clogged my pores!,"This product clogs my pores and breaks me out occasionally. This is the only new product I introduced to my skin care routine. Other than that, I don’t think it does anything to my face."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Malaysia,it's okay,"I use this at night after my serum and it's okay. Don't feel like it's life changing but does it's job. Perhaps due to the texture and formula, i should use it for daytime? "
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,"My skin is on the dry side, so I’m more partial to Tatcha’s dewy skin and ageless creams. That said, I recently got this silk cream in a value set and began using it again after many years (like maybe 3-4) of having not used it. It’s great especially for my morning routine and the slip of its gel-like texture is great. I actually find it more moisturizing now than when I had used this many years back. This is likely impactful for those who have normal-to-oily skin, like could be holy grail status; as for me, given my dry-leaning skin, it’s not holy grail but it is a great, effective moisturizer I can happily incorporate into my skincare routine."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,"Silky, light, and gentle","Been using this moisturizer for about two weeks now and I really like it! It’s a light, sort of gel-like texture. It hasn’t broken me out at all (sensitive skin over here) and is just moisturizing enough without feeling heavy at all. Sinks in fairly quickly and doesn’t pull with my other products. It’s think this is ideal for those with combo or oily skin (I’m combo, myself), but may not be moisturizing enough for those who are very dry. It’s perfect for daytime and for spring/summer. It has a very subtle but lovely scent. I took one star off due to its high price but will most likely repurchase."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,great for dry skin,"I have very dry and sensitive skin that gets oily through the day but stays dry feeling and gets flaky - it’s confusing tbh. I’m trying to change my skin care because the things I was using before were so hard to get a hold of - I could only get them from a specific place and it’s really far away. So recently I tried a different product that made my face break out into a itchy rash. I didn’t do any prior research before getting this because I was so desperate to fix my itchy face so I impulsively bought this, but I’m so glad I got this! It has helped with my dryness and itchiness a lot - considering how sensitive my face is. It has only been a few days since I started using it so I can’t really say much besides it helping me with my dry and sensitive skin. But I would definitely it let purchase this again, it’s worth the splurge for me!"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,A treat for the skin,"I think is is possibly my favourite cream from Tatcha.  I've tried several others, and this is the one that absorbs the best on my skin.  The texture is light, and it leaves my skin feeling soft.
Even though the price is a bit more than I'm usually comfortable paying, I've purchased it twice now, because I like the results I see.
I have hyper-sensitive skin that seems to react to practically everything. But it seems to like this just fine. 
I use it with the Silk Peony Melting Eye Cream when I want to give my skin a bit of extra TLC."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Pills!!!,"I was expecting this moisturizer to be the best of Tatcha. After already having tried the Dewy Skin and the Water Cream, I really wanted to love this product.  But I've never seen a moisturizer pill so badly, with or without foundation.  I gave it 2 hours to absorb, and then just swiped my hand across my cheek.  Wow, the moisturizer pilled and rolled like crazy.  Time to return this product."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Reduced redness on my sensitive skin,"This is my go to moisturizer! I have very sensitive skin and I'm always fighting redness left and right. I tried the tatcha indigo cream which is supposed work well with sensitive skin and, it did. But not as well as this one!! After 2 days of use, my redness decreased by so much! I'm seriously SHOCKED this helped so much at calming down my skin and I don't think I can even look at any other moisturizer ever again!!"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,"Tatcha's silk cream is my all-time FAVORITE moisturizer! I have tried many face moisturizers, including Clinique, Drunk Elephant, and Mamonde - Tatcha beats them all! Compared to Tatcha's dewy skin cream and water gel moisturizer, the silk cream definitely feels lighter and less oily. In fact, it doesn't feel greasy at all and absorbs into my skin extremely well. After applying the silk cream, my skin feels super smooth yet doesn't feel like there's anything on it (no stickiness). In terms of packaging, I like how there is a separate cover inside to prevent moisture and a spot to hold the little spoon so you never lose it!"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,"My skin was so dry and I was trying everything to help hold the moisture in my skin all day. This was my miracle answer! My skin is also prone to eczema and I haven’t had 1 flare up since using this. I’m also in my late 20’s and wrinkle are starting to form and this is helping them stay at bay. If you have sensitive, dry, and aging skin then this is your answer."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Canada,not impressive,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) it’s an okay moisturizer for normal to dry skin. it’s not super thick but i would call it in between of the drunk elephant protini and the lancôme absolue cream. it’s fragrance free which i do like like but does carry a slight alcohol scent which is unappealing. overall it’s not a terrible moisturizer but definitely not worth the money.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,the best!,"I’ve been using this moisturizer for the past 2 years and will never stop! 
I have extremely sensitive combo skin that is acne prone and this moisturizer is the only thing I’ve been able to use consistently. I use this at night and the dewy skin cream in the morning."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Malaysia,pricey but so-so,"The price has been increasing.I’m in my third 
jar and I won’t be continuing.At first it was a good mosturizer,not too much of a smell and not too thick or sticky and lasts quite a few months (4 months/jar for me) but now it doesn’t quite work so well for me as it used to..don’t expect any changes cos other than mosturiser it didn’t do anything else for me"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Malaysia,a tad too heavy,"Nice product - strong smell - a tad too heavy for my combo oily 30s skin eventho for night usage - heavier than dewy cream - still prefer dewy skkn cream and water cream
"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Malaysia,alright ,"I love the tatcha essence and hence wanted to try the silk cream . It was alright , my skin  didn’t absorb the silk cream quite well and it felt like it was sitting on my skin. I’m not sure if I might repurchase if but I nightly recommend the essence . "
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,beautiful silk cream!,I’ve been using this for about a month now and love it so much! I started using the dewy cream at night and this in the morning and it is the perfect match! This is a lighter cream that absorbs beautifully into the skin and makes my skin feels smoother than it ever has. I have very dry skin and it soaks this up! I have loved almost everything I’ve purchased from the Tatcha line and this is expensive but worth the price.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Malaysia,Silky!,This was a purchase made on behalf of my mother and she really enjoys this face cream. It is the cream she prefers to use at night and she enjoys it more than the Dewy Cream. She still prefers the green tub for daytime.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Great cream - not the best for irritated skin,"I love the silk cream and it smells so amazing. It's a great all-purpose moisturizer and I think would be perfect for normal skin types. My face felt so soft after using this product! My dry and sensitive skin, however, needs sometimes a little more intense, especially at night. It would also sting a little in areas where my skin was irritated."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Malaysia,Tatcha The Silk Cream,"Tatcha The Silk Cream. Very nice packaging. Bought for my mum birthday gift, and she very like it. Texture wise quite heavy and suitable to use for normal to dry skin."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,NOT Japanese. It's an American-Taiwan brand,"This is an American brand created by a Taiwan founder. People should know that they are buying a Japanese inspired product which appropriates Geisha culture.  I go to Japan every year, and there is no Tatcha in Japan. The salespeople at SK-II and Shiseido don't consider Tatcha to be Japanese either. I have tried Silk and Water cream, and both leave a lot to be desired. There are many gel like moisturizers available for 20% of this cost."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Australia,Mr,Nicely textured emollient as you would expect from Tatcha. Works well as both day or night moisturizer. Price point is a bit high but at least the packaging and content are of superior quality.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Do it...,I'm glad I did. You've already got it in your cart anyway. My skin has never been smoother.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,"This left quite a bit to be desired. Even after applying a generous amount my skin still felt as if it needed something more. I added a different moisturizer over this and felt much better. I wanted to like this, I really did."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,LOVE JUST WISH IT WAS CHEAPER!!!,"I removed a star for price because it’s insane $120! But I will say this is my favorite moisturizer of all time and it kills me that it’s so expensive! This moisturizer has perfect ingredients and does what it claims. When I wear this my skin is nourished, bright, and I don’t breakout or have any redness! It’s so perfect and I wish I could find a dupe for this because of how great it feels. My skin is really dry but can be combo during those times of the month but this is amazing with dry skin without being too heavy. The consistency is like the water cream but the hydration is like the dewy skin cream. It has no dimethicone as well which is so hard to find with moisturizer and I love that it has none because then it penetrates my skin deeper. LOVE!"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,"Soft, lightweight cream","Soft and lightweight, but keeps my face moisturized all day. I have dry skin and no known sensitivities. I also have the Water Cream and Dewy Cream, and while I like both, this is my favorite. (For my skin, the Water Cream needs an oil added on top or a reapplication later in the day. The Dewy Cream is better suited to nighttime, or those days when I want to stay in, slather on a thick heavy cream, and watch movies.) The Silk Cream is just perfection. I love it."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,overpriced and not as good as the Dewy Skin Cream,"Not as good as the Dewy Skin Cream. I've been using it for about a month and find The Dewy Skin Cream is better for my skin and less heavily scented (TDSC smells fresh, this smells overly floral). it doesn't moisturize as well as the other imo. I'll be going back to my tried and true when this jar is done. this is overpriced for what it does."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,"$120 per gar certainly leaves my skin smooth and shiny the next day, but when I try a $35 face cream from Kiehl's, it gives me the same result. So I don't know if that's my skin's problem or my wallet's problem."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Made me break out,"I didn't have acne prone skin, but this made me break out really badly (huge pimples all over my face) after 10 years of not having acne. After I stopped using this, my acne cleared up in 1 week. I wouldn't recommend this."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,"I got a mini sample from my BI rewards, and I'm liking this! A little goes a long way, just one ring finger dab is enough for both eyes.  I apply this on my eyelids, undereyes and the corners of my eyes. I don't have dark spots under my eyes, but I do have a lot of puffiness that can create a dark shadow. This product doesn't really help with the puffiness too much but def over time reduces and blurs the shadows. I have also noticed my eyes looking brighter and fine lines have disappeared. I've been using this for four weeks now every night before bed. I'm new to eye cream, but this has done a great job. My eyes feel so moisturized and less tired looking, although I still have some deep puffiness, I've noticed a BIG improvement."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Singapore,night cream ,I use this at night to hydrate my skin after a long day of wearing makeup. It is not greasy and absorbs quickly into the skin upon application. Lightweight. 
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,"love this moisturizer, I use it during the day all year as it has a really nice gel texture but still adds plenty of moisture, in the summer I also use it at nights, but during the winter I switch to the Dewey Skin cream and concentrate! the price is insane, but you can never go wrong with Tatcha and your skin will thank you"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Malaysia,amazing ,It’s an amazing addition to my skincare routine. During day I use it with the firming serum. In the night on top Of dewy night concentrate . Both times it worked wonders. During day my face was not oily but hydrated . And in the night super super glowy and dewy. By the way my skin is pretty dry so I had to use silk cream along with the night concentrate during night.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Worst Acne!,"I bought this cream, because I tried the sample and loved it. After the sample, I bought the full size. My skin never ever had any acne problems, but after using this cream, I started having pimples and blackheads on my forehead."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,BUY IT!!!!!,"FAVORITE. MOISTURIZER. EVER. I’m on my third or fourth tub of this. $120 for a moisturizer seems excessive, but trust me it is worth every penny! I’m in my 30s and I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to acne. I have combination skin, which usually tends to be on the dry side but can easily get too oily if I use the wrong products. This moisturizer gives me the perfect amount of hydration without leaving my skin feeling sticky and oily since the cream has a lightweight texture. It goes on great underneath makeup. It has not broken me out or irritated my skin. I use this on my face and on my neck. It keeps my skin looking hydrated, young, and bright. If I could only splurge on one skincare product, it would be this!!"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,Great moisturizing lotion that is great during the winter months.  A little goes a long way.  I see a lot of improvement in my skin since it’s normally quite dry.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Solid Face Cream,"I like this cream. A little goes a long way, which is great for the price.
It's lightweight but doesn't feel sticky like some lightweight creams do. Its not greasy either. It does give me a dewey complexion, which isn't my favorite, but i'll just use some matte powder to get rid of that. But if you like that dewey look it's great, it doesn't make you look oily.
It's not amazing, but also not terrible."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Singapore,Another repeated purchase!,"OMG I love this the most and I gotta say it’s probably the most expensive moisturiser I own. The scent is soooo calming and I loves how the skin looks so dewy, YET NOT OILY after application. I usually use this as my day moisturiser Everyday!"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,great for extra moisture,"I travel often and my skin dries out easily when climates change and this moisturizer keeps my skin soft and smooth in both. Plus, it’s a clean brand which I find doesn’t clog MY pores as easily!"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Malaysia,Amazing product in a cure little jar. ,This is a gel-cream moisturiser which feels heavy on the scoop. You need to warm it between your fingers before dabbing onto your face. Easily and rapidly absorbed and importantly it gives your skin a matte glow effect. I use it during the day as the texture is gel-like. I rated it 4/5 because of its expensive price. 
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Singapore,Great moisturiser,"I’ve always had problematic acne-prone skin even till now. Have been using this for a few years. Although expensive, a little goes a long way. This moisturises just nicely and yet is light due to the “silk” factor in the ingredients. I’ve sampled the other Tatcha creams on my hand and they feel heavier and stickier. "
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,10/10,"I've gone through 3 of these now. It's the best moisturizer I have ever used and I have very sensitive skin. Zero breakouts and makes my skin so soft. I use it before bed and before I put on makeup. 

My only complaint is that I wish they had a bigger size as I go through it pretty quickly. It's also expensive for the size."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,absolutely amazzzing!,By far my favorite tatcha cream and I love them all. I put off buying it for so long due to the price but it is worth every penny. It’s like a mix of the water cream and the dewy skin mixed together and creates this heavenly cream that is so incredibly soft and moisturizing. 100% would recommend
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Singapore,Nice feel,"Bought this 3 weeks back and has been using for more than 2 weeks now. I use this cream for night as I find that it gives me a very silky feel in the morning. It hydrates well and I do not feel dry on the skin the next day and in fact, the face feels more smooth and brighter. The smell is awesome too."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Malaysia,AZ ,"Rich and light at the same time. Like a mixed between cream and gel. Absorbs into skin easily. Non greasy feeling and non oily looks. Face definitely looks and feels silky soft. I think my pores had tighten too, which makes my makeup looks much better on me. However as for the lines and wrinkles - I am yet to see the positive effects. "
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,Feels like silk on my skin. I really enjoy putting this on my face each night. Love the smell. I believe it is worth the price. I've used lancome in the past and it has a very similar feel on my skin.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Very hydrating without clogged pores,"My skin is very sensitive. My pores clog easily. Some parts are dry; some parts are oily. For me, this cream does wonders! It has evened out the hydration in my skin without clogging my pores, and it just feels so moisturized. I have found that for myself, a few thinnish layers of products are the way to go. This cream is lush, but not heavy. Plus, there are no silicones, so in the winter if I add a sleeping mask over top, it can actually reach my skin! The price is a splurge, no doubt. But as far as I can tell from the ingredient list, there’s no cheap filler, so you’re actually paying for ingredients IMO. Plus, a pea-sized amount is enough for my face. It will last about four months. It does have a slightly tacky feel, but when applied at night, it absorbs by morning. And when applied in the morning, it actually serves as a nice primer for makeup, which doesn’t pill. I love it! I’ve used everything from drugstore to La Mer, and this is my favorite cream from my favorite skin care brand. The products works beautifully together, and I’m slowly using up everything in my routine and converting to Tatcha."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Silken skin- like a baby's bottom!,"This stuff is amazing. It really does help give that sort of poreless, silken complexion. My skin is soft and silky after using it for a while. It's pretty pricey but worth it for that lovely softness!"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,I’ve used this cream through several jars.  It doesn’t have dimethicone in it compared to other creams in this line and doesn’t break me out.   Yes it is pricey but a little goes a long way.  I use with the Camellia Oil cleanser and rice powder.  Perfect trio for me!
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,I like this cream but the price will prevent me from buying more in the future. I also use  Lancôme which I feel makes my skin feel very soft and has Spf in it for way less. The silk cream does feel nice and goes well with their primer of course but I doubt I’ll be buying this again. I would recommend this for someone who can afford this product repeatedly.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Malaysia,Ms.,I first got to know about Tatcha via some online research as I was going on a trip to US. Bought the starter kit in Sephora US and not long after I can find it in Sephora Malaysia too. One of the best moisturizer that I have invested in. Decided to give this a try as it contains collagen.  Will definitely get my second 
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Singapore,Tubful of luxury ,"The price turns you off at first, but I got it at the sale and this is one amazing cream. As the name, its spreads like silk and i love the faint smell is very nice! "
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,"This is a very pricey product which is a downside besides not having any SPF. This feels like a good day moisturizer because it’s light, but I also wear it at night sometimes although it doesn’t feel as moisturizing as the purple dewy skin formula. It’s just okay. It’s very similar to Dermalogica’s overnight cocoon cream which is a bit less expensive."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,Daily night moisturizer. Have used for a few years. Great for my sensitive skin. Isn't too heavy.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Worth it!!,I absolutely love this moisturizer! I ordered Tatcha's sampler to see which one of their creams worked best for me and I couldn't be happier with the Silk Cream. I used to use Clinique's moisturizer but my skin needed more hydration and this cleared up dry patches on my cheeks and also made my face more glowy. I use it with Tatcha's Vitamin C serum and my skin has seriously never looked better.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,One of my favorite moisturizers . I used it in the morning and it goes very well with any type of founfation
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,"I love this product!! It’s the only moisturizer I use that I do not have problem with. The other brands I’ve used does not give me the benefit I needed this brand is the only brand that truly helped me with dry skin issues! As much as I wish it’s cheaper.., but it’s worth my money. I cannot use the blue and purple moisturizer I can only use this silk cream as it helped me in all situation far better than any other creams in Sephora. This product is my number 1!!!"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,Very moisturizing ans silky. The only thing I don't love about it (besides the price) is it feels quite sticky on my face once completely dry.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Not worth the price,Replaced my water cream with this and I'm pretty disappointed. I see no additional hydration but my skin is going crazy right now and this is the only thing I've switched. I have acne like I haven't seen in years. I don't see improvement in any way. I'm going to continue using and hope that my skins just adjusting but I didn't have this issue with the luminous dewy concentrate or water cream. If you're on the fence I'd recommend the water cream over this.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Canada,Worst Acne of My Life,"I started using this cream and shortly after broke out in the worst acne I've ever had in my life.  I had 50+ zits all over my forehead, cheeks, and chin.  I didn't realize it could be the cream causing it, I thought Tatcha made good products so i didn't stop using it immediately.
As soon as I did stop using the cream, the acne started to disappear.  Still not completely gone, but getting better :/"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,silky dream skin,"This is the best night time cream ever! I cleanse my face and apply this and my face feels like literal silk. I wake up and my skin is perfect, this is not an exaggeration. This is worth the high price because you don't need to apply too much to see results."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Not worth it!,I got this as a sample and loved it so I took the plunge and bought it even though it's really expensive. I had read the other reviews about it causing break outs but there didn't seem to be that many. After a week of using it my skin is starting to look really blotchy and pimples are cropping up all over my skin. Definitely not worth the money at all.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Makeupless skin goals,"I’ve been using this with the Biossance Lactic Acid every night (so far about week and a half) and it’s produced amazing results. My skin is smoother, firmer, pores and redness have all reduced! It has a jelly-like consistency and is very lightweight. Some people felt that it was not moisturizing enough, but with the combination of using Biossance’s lactic acid first, then Silk right after, it gives it that perfect balance. No breakouts from this at all. During the day I use Tatcha’s dewy in the morning and it lasts all day! I’m a PCOS girl, so skin acne is definitely a challenge. Even just using the silk cream by itself was already amazing!"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Treat Yourself!,"After using this product for two weeks I have to say, this is my FAVORITE item in the Tatcha line. The silk cream feels weightless on my skin and creates a burst of hydration. It leaves my skin feeling so silky and moisturized throughout the day. Putting on this silk cream is currently my favorite step in my skin care routine."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Canada,Love it!,Actually quite liking it~ I've been using it almost a month and I like how it doesn't feel sticky after applying and it's easy to absorb by the skin. My skin doesn't get overly oily after a long day even the t-zone. Will definitely continue with this jar.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,tatcha is been my best friend!!!! ;),Amazing all tatcha products are Soo great....loving it soo far since I bought it... but the dewy moisturizer is a lot more hydrating but this product is also great I use both creams on my face as my skin needs...
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Perfect for dry AND oily skin.,I have very dehydrated yet oily skin so I tried the tatcha water cream and it still wasn’t enough moisture for me. I decided to give this one a try and it has to be the best moisturizer I have ever used. Yes it is pricey but is lasting me forever! It leaves a film of silk protein on your skin then prevents moisture loss and it doesn’t break me out like everything else !!! Forever inloveeee. Get yourself a sample and you will thank me.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Silky Sorbet for your Skin,"It has a jelly sorbet texture. Very light and refreshing to apply in the morning. I use it as my pre-makeup moisturizer, but I don't feel like it deeply hydrates my skin. I do like the scent; very light."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Left my skin feeling parched,"I have been taking care of my skin since I was in high school. I have tried moisturizers from Shiseido, Amore Pacific, Lancôme, Estée Lauder, and Dr Perricone. Tatcha’s The Silk Cream was my least favorite. 

 The Silk Cream was the only revision that I made to my regimen for three months. My skin felt hydrated only for a short period of time before it felt completely parched. I live in NYC and used this cream daily morning and night in the winter. I had to reapply at least four times a day to feel the least bit hydrated. On the days I did not, my skin would hurt. The Dewy Skin cream is slightly stickier but lasts longer. 

Despite the hefty price tag, the product is still very watery and therefore, does not travel well."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,"Did nothitng for my dry, rough and sensitive skin","Did nothing for my terribly dry and sensitive skin. I was very disappointed with this product with such a high price tag. I have combination skin that gets terribly dry, rough and sensitive in the winter. This cream did not cause me any additional issues which is great bu also did nothing to help my skin. I used it religiously every night for over a month but no results. I feel like it just sits on top of my skin but doesn't do anything to help it. I tried a travel size of the Tatcha water cream and I think I really like it. I won't be repurchasing this but i m considering repurchasing the water cream, I am only using it up so it doesn't go to waste."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,so this is loveeeeee,"Wow, iv dabbled my way through moisturizers but gosh this is just sooo nice. Its so hydrating w/o it being soooo oily? Does that make sense? It feels so light weight, when yiu apply it. Almost feels like lil burst of water when you spread it. This is definitely good for thw winter (probably will change it up for the summer)"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,A big thumbs up it doesn’t break me out.,This silk cream will give you a real hydration for your skin. I love it.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Perfect night cream for normal /combo skin,"I have been searching for a gentle yet nourishing night cream forever. I have a lot of actives in my skin routine, (retinol, vit c, lactic acid serums etc.) and al wanted a norishing night cream which would just moisturise! This is the perfect one! It makes my skin look like silk, literally! I love that my skin instantly feels hydrated, yet not greasy. I wake up with Uber smooth and moisturised skin. Not dry patches like before. My skin is normal to combination. I will also be using this in my morning routine during the winter months for extra hydration. And switch to the water cream during the spring/summer months. My routine mainly consists of tatcha products :)"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Dry skin again 10 minutes later....,"For $120 dollars I was expecting too see a change in the texture and appearance of my skin, sadly that didn't happen. Once applied, my face is dry again 10 minutes later (and I'm not even notorious for having dry skiin!!!!). The product also feels kind of heavy on the skin, at least it doesn't break me out because I do have acne prone skin. I'm going back to the water cream for sure."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,MEH,It feels great going on and makes your skin soft. But I saw no change in my skin and it is definitely not worth the price tag. I think you can find much better options for a fraction of the cost.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Canada,Tatcha The Silk Cream,"Nice texture and smell. Skin feels really good after apply the cream. The price tag of $156 Canadian dollar is a bit too much. If it is within the same range of water cream or dewy cream, I will purchase again."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Canada,Not moisturizing enough,"Great scent, texture and packaging but that's where my love ends.
It's simply just not moisturizing enough for my fourth year old dry skin. Minutes after the cream is applied and absorbed, my face feels stretchy and dry.
I tried to combine it to Tatcha's oil which I love but I'm just not getting good results.
I'm switching back to my previous moisturizer it's a shame as I really wanted to love this product."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,fantastic texture and light fragrance,"I went from La Mer to this cream and also the Dewy Tatcha cream and I don’t regret it. It is definitely not as emollient, but it is fresh and has a nice feel to it. It’s not thick or greasy and would be best for normal to dry skin. I use this in the morning and it does take a few minutes to fully absorb. My make up stays put and doesn’t run. I do not have issues with being dry during the day or oily in the afternoon from using this cream. I have not used the water cream, so I am not able to give that comparison. I am not giving this 5 stars, as it doesn’t work as a day and night cream for me. It does leave my skin feeling silky and on no make up days it does give me a hydrated healthy glow."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,perfect,"very nice and hydrite cream ,  i love it. i already use PURE ONE STEP CAMELLIA CLEANSING OIL for make up removal is lilltle bit expensive but he worth it ."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Found the *one*,"I'm one of the few that aren't fans of the water cream. In fact, I despise it (shh). I love almost every single product from Tatcha so when I realized I didn't try this, I went to a local sephora and got a sample. After going back for more samples (of this), I had to buy it. It doesn't break me out like the water cream, is extremely silky and sinks in. I also prefer the fragrance of this. I would recommend this if the water cream isn't working for you and you want a little more luxury. In comparison to the dewy skin cream, it's less heavy than that and very similar to the consistency of the water cream but just happens to work for my sensitive skin. I also actually notice skin results with this moisturizer (as I find with many moisturizers, they just do the minimum). This product has made my skin plump, glowing and radiant!"
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,Canada,Lovely !,Love it !! It’s so nice and smooth!! Love the feel of this cream and it smells so so good !
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,,loveeeee,Onto my second bottle and loving it! Smell is fresh but very faint. Good for those who doesn’t like products with a strong scent. Hydrating as well. The only downside is the expensive price tag.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,I love this product. My skin was normal-dry but just needed a pick me up. Now my skin looks so bright and clear.
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Bad reaction,"Holy mother of cystic acne. I’m sure this won’t be the case for everyone, but this product broke me out terribly. It was the only change in my routine. I gave this the good old college try, three nights total since i love other tatcha products, but it’s pretty clear the problem was only getting worse. Will be returning. Suggest staying away if you have sensitive, combination skin."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Holy Grail Moisturizer,"I am in LOVE with this moisturizer! It absolutely does make your skin feel like silk. At first, I thought it was a bit too heavy and it was leaving my skin feeling sticky like the product wasn’t fully absorbing. However, after a week or so I realized that I was just using too much moisturizer. I began to use a smaller amount and WOW! It absorbed immediately and left no sticky residue. When they say a little goes a long way they aren’t exaggerating! I use a tiny pearl size amount and that is enough for my entire face and neck. It’s also very soothing for my skin. I have extremely sensitive skin and this feels like heaven going on! It’s quickly become my favorite part of my daily skincare routine. I have recommended it to family and will definitely be buying this forever! My new Holy Grail moisturizer."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Tatcha The Silk Cream,"I absolutely adore tatcha products. I am currently using the polish, essence, vit c serum and this moisturizer as a part of my nighttime care routine. This is one of the only lines that do not break me out. It smells nice and light which is a must for me and although I’ve only been using it for 2 weeks I have noticed that my skin is bright and softer."
TATCHA-The Silk Cream,USA,Great product,Great but a little expensive. I got a sample so I’ll see if it’s worth buying. Love the smell and feeling.
LANCÔME-Clarifique Brightening Plumping Milky Cream,Singapore,Bright and supple skin,"I have oily combi skin so this cream is slightly more rich for me. It will be better for dry skin types. I use sparingly and spread on my palms before pressing onto my face, otherwise I will have bumps... so far so good. This moisturiser will make your skin glow with radiance. Too bad Sephora doesn't carry the stock for Clarifique emulsion.  "
LANCÔME-Clarifique Brightening Plumping Milky Cream,Malaysia,For  friend,"I got this for a friend and I personally think this clarifique range does a better job than the old blanc expert range. in term of quality, the texture of this cream is nice, and not sticky"
LANCÔME-Clarifique Brightening Plumping Milky Cream,Singapore,my fave moisturiser ,"
I love this product so much. I used it around 2 years already. Still I opposed with moisture. It’s give moisture with brining effect. Love this product."
LANCÔME-Clarifique Brightening Plumping Milky Cream,Singapore,so hydrated,"So far love this milky cream,leaves your skin hydrated the whole day ,moist and plump!not so pleasant at the smells compared to hydra zen but bearable!"
LANCÔME-Clarifique Brightening Plumping Milky Cream,Singapore,Works wonder!,Noticed the brigthen skin after few application. Love this cream on my skin and affordable compared to other skincare range. Would definitely repurchase and continue using this
LANCÔME-Clarifique Brightening Plumping Milky Cream,Singapore,must buy,thankfully this cream absorbs fast and not sticky at all. half a jar is already gone and it really helps with the pigmentation on the face and soothe the skin
LANEIGE-Time Freeze Intensive Cream EX,Philippines,fav! ❤️😊,This is actually one of my favorite creams! It’s been phase out in Laneige Philippines for so long. So glad I found it here!! Safe for sensitive skin. I got this on sale. Will definitely repurchase. :) 
LANEIGE-Time Freeze Intensive Cream EX,Malaysia,Laneige moisturiser,Bought this moisturiser for my mum for daily use. She likes the texture of this moisturiser for anti-aging purposes. The product is hydrating aside from its firming properties. 
LANEIGE-Time Freeze Intensive Cream EX,Malaysia,Time Freeze,This cream is super moisturising. It absorbs quickly and really helps with my dry skin. Its does not leave a sticky residue at all. It’s a good base for my make up. My make up does not cake after applying this.
LANEIGE-Time Freeze Intensive Cream EX,Malaysia,hydrating,Something that I bought after been using laneige products almost a decade.instantly hydrates and keep the skin moist whole day long...worth it and may try with good serum as well to see the best result.
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,refreshing ,This is great for use after cleansing on a hot day. Feels very refreshing on the skin. there is this slightly cooling feeling. I wouldn't use this on extremely dry skin as I find this quite light. I have oily skin so this is okay for me. Didn't break me out. But I probably wouldn't repurchase as there arr better moisturizers out there for this price. 
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,Ms,"I really enjoyed using this. I prefer gel 
moisturisers for day time use as they dont feel oily and sticky during the day. Purchased the small bottle as I want to try and see if I like it. Will buy the big bottle next time. "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Miss,"Great product and safe for breakout skin. The price is reasonable for sephora brand. Usually will use it before makeup. It will make my skin glow n stay hydrate. However, dif skin will have diff result. "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,engineer ,"
Keeps my face moisturized but slightly oily given I have a dry complexion. I think personally there are other drugstore moisturizer that could deliver a similar result without making my face feel oily 
"
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,does its job,"Keeps skin moisturised but does not absorb well. Will not use as day moisturiser as it leaves an oily sheen, especially on t-zone. Strange effect since it’s supposed to be oil-free"
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Good one!,I buy the small package and end up buy the 75ml. ahaha
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,Origins Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer - 30ml,"Tried as a sample, broke me out. Didn’t do a thing"
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,Origins Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer - 30ml,I couldn’t feel the energy boost from this product. My face felt pretty sticky after applying. The packaging is cute and compact.
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,Love it ,Have been uses this for ages - love it 
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Best moisturiser ever!,Love this so much I have been using this since my uni days! Light texture and love the citrus smell. Recommended this moisturiser to my siblings too and they loved it.
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,honest review,it doesn't works with my skin.. after applying I felt itchy.. may be not suitable for my dry and sensitive skin.. but I like the smell.. it's like tangerine
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,Best cream for combination skin. ,"Did not feel greasy at all after applied. The smell is so good, like orange and ginseng sell. I’m addicted with it. This is the first purchase during my birthday. The first origin’s product I tried is the mushroom water treatment. It’s work on my pimple. "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,Origins Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer - 30ml,i love this product and the way it spreads. i have super oily skin and have definitely noticed a difference. i especially love how lightweight it is.
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,oily combo skin,"was searching for gel type moisturizer and came across this product by chance at sephora store. Decided to try and im glad i bought this, it glides like butter on my skin and kept my skin matte whole day."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,GREASY ON FACE,I’m combination skin type person. Personally it doesn’t work with my skin. Greasy. Overpriced and doesn’t worth at all ! I wasted my own money to buy this product but I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone😔
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,#1 moisturizer ,"Tried the first time then second then third then forever! Been using this for years, my go to moisturizer! Love the smell and after feel application. Highly recommended!"
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,It works!,"This is the only product that improves my oily skin! No more shiny face at work. I tried several oil-free moisturizers, and they either cause breakouts or worsen the shine. I'm definitely going to purchase this product again."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,Gin my Zing please.,"I really like this for my make up free days when all I use is a light moisturizer. However, if you apply anything afterwards, it beads up and looks/feels like your skin is peeling off. It's a bit weird, but the product itself is really good."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,use it every morning,"Not that much different after a week. The smell is nah for me. But worth to try. It may take some time to see the result. But overall, just not a fans. It is not  a bad product..just not for me."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,Smells Good... Absorbs Terribly.,"Bought this because of the lemon, grapefruit, and citrus oils as I thought it would be similar to effects of a vitamin c moisturizer... however it does absolutely nothing. Smells lovely, but sits on top of the face and once “absorbed” leaves the skin feeling dry to the point where when I touch my face I can literally feel that the product has disappeared. Even when I mix it with The Ordinary’s Squalene solution which adds that extra layer of moisture to the skin when applied with a moisturizer it still does NOTHING. Tried it by itself and with added products. It may be cheaper than a lot of other moisturizers depending on your budget but it’s just not worth the purchase. Probably going to end up tossing it and chalking it up as a lost."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Not for my skin type,"It is a light weight moisturizer. It leaves my skin with flaky texture. I gave to my aunt to try it out and she loves it. So, I guess the moisturizer does not suit my skin type."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,Weird Texture and Pills,"I love the smell, but that’s all. Like others, I’m having issues with it pilling and leaving a weird film on my face. I wanted to try this because I love the Fresh Vitamin C moisturizer, and thought this might offer similar results."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,Love this! ,"I love this moisturiser! It’s oil free which is great for me because I do have combination skin, oily with dry patches. It’s good at helping with my dry spots without making me even more oily. It’s not a heavy duty moisturiser but in Singapore’s humid weather I think it’s perfect. 

Also, it does not break me out. It took me a while to find a moisturiser that does not break me out and this is it. I have repurchased this item and would definitely buy it again once I run. It works for me! "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,I’m not a fan.,"In my opinion, this is terrible. There is nothing moisturizing or hydrating about this. I personally didn’t like the consistency of the moisturizer either. I don’t have sensitive skin, and my skin is combo/acne prone. Although, this product didn’t worsen or harm my skin, it definitely didn’t improve or help. I would not recommend this. Murad’s vitamin c line is WAY better."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,Would repurchase ,"Ive been using this product for about a week now. I have very sensitive skin and so far it hasnt broke me out. Pretty happy with the product. Subtle smell to it, not very over powering. A little goes a long way!"
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Ah maaazziiinnggg,"I have used this moisturizer for a week now (as day). Loving how it sits on the skin. not oily, almost mattify yet you still feel moisturized. I use ole henriksen C and i feel like this can be a dupe for it! "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,The Best !,"OMG you guys! This is by far one of the best moisturizer I’ve ever bought. I woke up, my under eyes is puffed & look like bloated. After normal cleanse routine, I use this moisturizer but I put extra for my under eyes. After 10 mins, my puffy eyes is gone, poofff ! It really does everything that it says. The ginseng is better than the matte one. Loveee it !"
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,love it!!,I personally love the smell but if you're a person who can't stand strong scents in products then this is probably not for you. the moisturiser works really good on my skin 
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,Origins Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer - 30ml,Smells good but horrible product. You would think you bought it from the dollar store. Balls up and then you have small clumps all over your face.
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Not great for sensitive skin,"I bought this thinking that it will help brighten my skin from a bad tan, but it ended up irritating my sensitive skin. This product also causes pilling on the skin, and the orange smell is at first pleasant but it's actually way too strong for sensitive skin. Would not recommend"
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,LOVE IT,"By far the best moisturizer I've used.. bought the 30ml to give it a try and was so impressed that I purchased 50ml the next round. I noticed that my skintone is more even, looks brighter and more glowy after using this. Also works well for combination skin, doesn't leave my face looking like a greaseball or feeling sticky throughout the day. Would totally recommend."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,loveeee ,I buy the product because someone recommends it 😅 but when I use it I’m instantly falling in love 🧡🧡🧡 Really love the smell cause it smell nice like 🍊🧡
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Okay,"The texture is good, the smell is so good. 
Not leaving wowww impact. But, it is still doing it job. Okay, I try to finish it and I hope it will give impact as how it claimed it. "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,my skin love it! ,i used to use the cream moisturizer.. but i think too heavy for my skin. then I try thus mini size of gel moisturiser. and my skin love it so much. everyday i wake uo with a glow skin. thank you
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,customer,"I always wanted to try this as i saw a lot of people mention that this product is good. After a week with this, i can see that my skin complexion getting better. Its not bright, but its not dull. Didnt do anything to my acne. So yah, if you are looking for something to reduce your dullness, this is a good try"
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,Not bad.,My first try. Very light gel moisturiser. Easy to apply and absorb well. Pleasant smell. It doesn't feel heavy at all. Not the best but overall a good moisturiser. Prefer a bottle moisturiser instead of a jar due to hygiene purposes.
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Ms,I have enjoyed using this gel cream. it is suitable for my oily skin. It has a very nice citrus scent which I love. The cream absorbs into my skin quickly.
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,Perfection,"I will be honest and say this isn't my go-to daily moisturizer, especially during winter, but only because I prefer a more dewy finish and my skin is super dry. That said, I have zero complaints about this product. It was the first gel moisturizer I ever tried(received as a gift) and it's still the high standard I measure other gel moisturizers against. And unlike many gel moisturizers, this one is actually effective enough on its own that I don't have to add any extra layers under or over it to keep my skin from feeling too dry and tight. Plus it smells heavenly. Highly recommend."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,Perfect summer moisturizer for combo skin,"I struggle to find a good moisturizer for the summer. Cream moisturizers that I usually use during fall and winter are too thick for summer and make my skin oily. I’m usually hesitant to use gel moisturizers because they go on thin and don’t feel hydrating at all. You get the best of both worlds with this gel moisturizer. My skin feels completely hydrated but doesn’t get oily. There’s no spf, but I just use Coola on top so it settles in and doesn’t get greasy."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,Love it! ,"I have oily skin type. I use it at every night. The cream can be easily absorbed into the skin. However, it will leave a little bit sticky feel after that, as compared to the Matte Moisturizer. Really just a little tiny sticky feel. It btw won't bring any uncomfortable feel to me. The smell is fresh and feel sooo good. Like vitamin! It really helpful in oil controlling. I can feel my face is smooth after applying it. Recommended. "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,Perfect Spring/Summer Moisturizer,Hands down my favorite moisturizer. I have combo skin and so I need an effective but not greasy moisturizer and this is it. I've never had a problem with Origins as a brand. The smell is light and refreshing while the cream itself soaks in relatively quickly and need be applied conservatively in my opinion (I like to use the slick of my toner and serum to help spread the moisturizer and save on using excess product).
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,not bad,It's a lightweight moisturiser but doesn't seem to 'work' well when accompanied with some skincare items. It gives 'flaky' bits when building on with other skincare items so you'll have to trial and error to see what it goes with. 
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,Hydrates as needed,Good hydrating cream and pleasant smell. Sometimes observed skin dryness in few areas after few hours of application.
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,Ms ,I love it so much. I left half a star to give it perfect because it can’t be used with make up foundation. It will turn flaky texture and wear off. Otherwise the smell is lovely and texture is watery which is good when you apply it on its own. 
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,good one,"This is my first time using this product. This moisturizer  
is giving my skin moisturize and make my skin really smooth and brighten. Worth purchasing this item and will re purchase it again soon. Recommended. "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,So so,"Its no that good, it leaves a film in my face and its kinda irritate my face in its fragrance aka essential oils, i dont know, may be its not just compatible in the skin on my face. "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,lightweight!,"When I opened the jar, the smell is so fresh as it has a scent of orange zest. When I slide it on my face, it is soooo smooth and lightweight. It is absorbed quickly into my skin and does not feel tacky or oily at all. It is so travel friendly as the size is small but on hygiene aspect, it is less as it is in a jar but you can make sure to keep your hand clean and just swipe it. "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Super moisturizer,I'm super loveee this moisturizer. Will repurchase it since it was super good even i have sensitive skin but it was soothing and hydrathing. Just put little portion on your face and ur are ready.

ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,The best I’ve tried so far,"My favorite moisturizer. All origins products please me. Although the brand is a little pricy I always splurge to get these products because nothing else works as good without irritating my skin. It’s really not that much considering how long the containers last, and compared to other brands. 
This moisturizer is lightweight, feels clean, smells great without being overwhelming, and does the job. Even the smallest container will last a while."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Too sticky,"I buy for trying.. Unfortunately, It doesn't suit with my skin.. My skin become itchy and have tiny bump😔 Somemore the gel was soo sticky when applied to the skin. "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,3rd purchase already!,My absolute skincare routine. Mosturize my skin perfectly well. Doesn't make my skin feel too oily or dry at all. Most definitely suits my combination skin. 
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,Ok everyday use,"Its an okay not so bad everyday moisturizer that you just slap on and leave the house. Fragrance reminds me of mornings, it doesn’t annoy me but if you’re sensitive to fragrance, maybe give this a pass? "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Good,"Really loved the smell and texture, very moisurizing but I didn't quite liked it. Not sure why exactly. perhaps it didn't go well with my other facial productss




















.......?..

ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,Not suitable for me,"I have been using ddg peeling pad & decided to go for a more cost efficiency moisturizer, but then my face break out immediately after using this, already purchased ddg moisturizer & hope the same line product will be more suitable, one star for the smell did smell very nice."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,good moisturiser,first time using it. it is a good moisturiser. i have a very dry skin and this is gives me a subtle hydration that i need. but it does make my skin feels alive. so far so good
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,light and mositurizing ,"I’ve always used heavier and creamier products, but thought to add something lighter to the mix to keep the skin more balanced. This does the work of mositurizing, but do know that it’s light and easily absorbed. I didn’t feel that it delivers anything special, so would not repurchase."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Miss,"Finished this small jar in 2months. This is indeed a very light weight moisturiser, however it does not deliver sufficient moisture to the skin as it claims. Skin gets rather dry after few hours of applying it. The only plus point is that it has very pleasant orangey smell. "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,PERFECT AMOUNT OF MOISTURE!,I have combination skin and I’ve struggled to find a good moisturizer that doesn’t make me feel like my face is drenched in oil or very dry when I wake up. I’ve tried soooo many moisturizers that were too heavy or did nothing... This made my skin feel very refreshed! Especially when waking up. It was literally the perfect balance! This also sits well on my face under my makeup (before primer). A little really goes a long way! My face feels sooooo gooooood. This has been repurchased & will continue to be.
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,life saver,"I have used Pixy for the first time after listening to all its hype reviews...honestly, it works for me but by bit...have been using it for a week...Really remove dirt effectively...Reduced my breakouts and make my skin more make up friendly, easy to apply my foundation....Loving this new toner...gonna use for long term and see more differences in future..."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer 30ml,"This product is the bomb. My face didnt feel greasy after i applied it and it is also lightweight, so for those looking for a lightweight moisturiser this is for you to buy. "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Non stick moisturizer,"the smell is comfortable with citrus scent. abit oily when first apply but after it absorbs, not oily anymore. dont see a very big difference after using."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,No further buybacks,"This moisturizer is a bit hard to use. Could it be my skin? Need enough protect wet, still cannot thick apply protect wet frost, must thin besmear goes up, can have the effect of flaking otherwise
"
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Singapore,Love it!,"i love this moisturiser and also its smell! i have a combination skin. After applying this moisturer, i can feel that my skin are getting fresh and smooth. i love origins products which always never disappointed me. "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Holy Grail Moisturizer ,I love this Moisturizer. I have combination skin and this Moisturizer is just perfect. I've been looking for a good Moisturizer for so long and nothing can beat this. I love the texture and the scent and its so good to the skin. 
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,Ms,"Super suitable for my oily skin. It smells nice, easily absorb into the skin and 30ml lasts for about 2 months++. Worth to buy. Been my holy grail since ever "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,"would not buy, sadly",It smells like an orange creamsicle but it's not too overwhelming. I really wanted to like it but I hated how it dried. The product would easily come off from lightly rubbing your face post drying. It formed into this grey gunk and i don't understand why. Luckily it was gratis cause it now sits collecting dust.
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,Dosent help oily skin break outs,This moisturizer smells greate but doesn’t work for my oily skin. it’s supposed to be for oily skin but it cause my skin to break out instead of helping it. I bout it about a week a go online and unfortunately because of quarantine situation I cant return it to store!
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,Malaysia,great,"I bot this bcuz of a review, totally love this, love the texture, it thick n vry moisturising, smells amazing, this product will remain in my skincare routine "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,,strong fragrance in the Moisturiser ,"Had been using this for 4 days, the bright side is it is a lightweight Moisturiser which melt in the skin within few seconds after applied, really good to apply under my make up👍🏿. 
But on the other hand, it smells like orange and has too much extract and fragrance in it. 
But in conclusion, it is worth the money but still, there's other Moisturiser better than this. "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,,great product,"Worth buying , it does what it claims. It is easily absorbed and doesn't leave sticky feeling. I prefer this range compared to willowherb range as it will make your skin sting upon application. "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,,Good moisturiser ,"Smells very good and refreshing in the morning. Was hydrating and refresh. I'm sensitive skin, and this mosturiser suit me well. I will recommend to friend. "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,eye cream,I just got there eye cream. And I really like it. My eyes don’t feel or look tired. I got the mini size I think it’s perfect. You don’t need a lot just a bit and enough
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,,Hydrating and non oily,"It hydrating while non-oily as described, works well for my combination skin. Even under hot weather it doesn't give oily feel, which is just what I need!"
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,Origins Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer - 30ml,"I generally love origins and I wanted to try this ginzing line of products but I believe this whole line is a bust. On the origins website the other product from this collect, the toner spray, is rated very low as well, and this is not a good moisturizer at all. I was tempted by the oil- free part because of my oily skin but I totally missed the gel part, which ruins this cream completely. This thing barely soaks in and dries up. You have to let it dry sooo long and even after that the products that go on top are moving around. I bought it for the am moisturizer and that didn’t work out because it doesn’t keep anything in place. Now I know that I absolutely don’t like gel moisturizers. It is also hard for me to see any great qualities to it, since the cons are overwhelming and I will not repurchase. I ended up using it up for chest hands and just misc parts."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,,superb,2nd purchase on this product. Amazing moisturiser 💕 i love the smell so much. Orange citrus smell so good 😊 can’t wait to repurchase it. Hope to get more discounts hahaha
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,,This cream does exactly as it says. ,"This cream does exactly as it says. It smells really nice (hint of orange)￼ It is Perfect for all skin types. It is hydrating, refreshing and gives your skin that perfect energy boost. Absolutely love it! I have sensitive skin too and I have had no problems whatsoever with this cream! Really happy with this product￼￼￼￼￼ And I would definitely recommend"
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,,Love it! ,"The texture is soft and seeps into the skin! Does NOT leave any residue and does not leave skin feeling oily. Could really feel the energizing energy. Second purchase, good dupe for Tatcha water cream (plus the zing feels)! Would purchase again! "
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,smells great but not as good in cold weather,"i’m on the fence about this. i love the smell and the lightness of this product but don’t think it was meant for cold weather. i was dealing with what i now realize was post-vacation skin peeling and found myself reapplying this several times an hour! it’s great in warmer weather, and paired with certain serums or cleaners it will give that “glow effect” for a short while after applying. however, i’ll have to wait until the summer to see how it holds up."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,LOVE IT,so I have been trying this for the two weeks and my skin feels amazing not greasy at all since i do have oily/combo skin I love put it on every morning smells amazing

ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,love the scent,"The scent is really pleasant. Texture quite smooth, though Javier than I expected it is not clogging. Will restock for sure. Some other oil free has too much silicone that makes makeup hard to stay, but this doesn’t which makes me very happy."
ORIGINS-Ginzing Oil-Free Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer,USA,love it!,"I love this moisturizer, it leaves a cool effect and absorbs nicely.."
BURT'S BEES-Sensitive Night Cream,Singapore,rather disappointing ,"Not too impressed with this cream, really. Used it for two weeks, but no results whatsoever. I really wanted so much for it to work! Such a bummer to have spent money on it. "
BURT'S BEES-Sensitive Night Cream,Singapore,wow,Surprisingly work wells for my oily combo face! Did not have pimples after using . Btw i pair with hydration serum as my cheeks area are dry .
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Ferulic + Retinol Anti-Aging Moisturizer,Singapore,A starter to using retinol,"If you would like to use a retinol based product, you can try this moisturiser. Despite it containing retinol, it still leaves the skin moiturised the day after. Also, it also contains ferulic acid which is an anti-oxidant which helps to fight off free radicals. A little pricey but it is worth a try!"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Ferulic + Retinol Anti-Aging Moisturizer,Malaysia,Too Expensive,Love and hate relationship with this. It works as what they claim but too expensive for me. 
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Ferulic + Retinol Anti-Aging Moisturizer,Singapore,first time use,"this is my first time purchase this product, i’ve been using for almost 2 months, I don’t know if my face is sensitive to this product it starts to have a little pimple on my face,

"

DR. DENNIS GROSS-Ferulic + Retinol Anti-Aging Moisturizer,Singapore,Great Product,I was looking for a good retinol moisturiser and heard good reviews about the dr dennis gross one. it’s a good moisturiser but i dont like the smell of it. overall it seems to work well
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,excellent day moisturizer,"I adore this moisturizer so much! The full experience is fantastic, and I look forward to using it every morning. It smells and feels wonderful and luxurious. It is a thicker consistency, and a tiny bit can go a long way. It took me a little over 2 months to go through my first container, and I was using it morning and night the entire time. I've switched to using it only in the day, so I anticipate this second container will last even longer. It layers great with all of my other morning products, and leaves my skin feeling soft and looking radiant even after putting on SPF."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,A must have for dry skin,Just what my dry skin was craving!! I will continue to purchase this cream as I love how hydrated my face feels.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Clear Skin,This moisturizer and their cleanser gave me some pretty clear skin which I didn’t expect. Almost felt effortless. Didn’t want to love it but I secretly do.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,LOVE this product!,I LOVE This product! I've only used it for a few days but so far so good. The smell is a lovely orange smell but not over powering. The texture is luxurious and very hydrating. My skin is dry and mature and I've had no bad reactions to it.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Singapore,Good C cream ,I like this cream as it’s small packaging and I can carry it with me everywhere I go. It leaves skin with glow. I use this usually few times a week. The price is not expensive and it’s a value for money. 
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Very thick,"Purchased this because I swear by the vitamin C brightening serum. It’s VERY thick and makes my skin look almost oily, so I use it at night. It might be good for someone w dry skin. I definitely won’t purchase again."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,smells so good,This is the best smelling face cream ever. So hydrating.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,"I love this moisturizer, it’s a very small amount but a little goes a long way. I use it everyday and it makes my skin look moisturized and not dry at all"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Malaysia,best moisturiser ,"I’ve purchased this over and again, just keep going back to this moisturiser because it really makes a huge difference in my skin care routine. I use this daily at night and my face feels much better in the morning! Highly recommended "
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Malaysia,C.E.O C + E,"My skin feels soft , radiant and glowing after apply it , a little bit goes a long way not bad ."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,only okay,"I got this moisturizer as a substitute for the purple tatcha as it was sold out and it has honestly only been okay, i’ve been using it for like three weeks and with acne scarring i haven’t seen any results. I also noticed that this product fully dried tends to pill? (I’ve fixed this by applying some snail mucilin lotion before this one) Overall it smells good and has a cool applicator but i probably would not repurchase."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Not what I thought.,"While I want to love this product, it seems so refreshing with its light citrus scent, I just don’t feel like it moisturizes as well as it claims. I feel dry, especially in the under eye and cheek area even after use. Very disappointing."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,Amazing Product,This product is amazing!!! I chatted with a beauty advisor and this was the first product she recommended to me. I thought it’s expensive so I asked for more suggestions but ended up buying this one because of the benefits plus the rating. And I didn’t make a mistake. It helped me with my very dry skin in just 2 days and gave me a nice glow. So worth it.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Malaysia,Ms,"Work wonders on my skin and surprisingly it didnt break me out at all. Note: I have a very super sensitive skin. Purchasing the big size hydration cream, now it almost finish. Just amazing. "
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Love the scent and how it feels on my skin. I like my moisturizer to be on the thicker side and this one is. Will totally purchase the regular size eventually.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Malaysia,Ms,I have dry skin esp on my T zone. This moisturizer texture kinda have oil base which is great on my skin. I love this. I combined with niacinamide to achieve best result 👍🏻
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,My favorite daytime moisturizer!,"Love this stuff! You only need to apply a thin amount and your skin will feel comforted and nourished. I use this everyday following the other Sunday Riley daytime products (oil and serum) and my skin stays hydrated through the day. I used to get dry patches on part of my cheeks, but yet grease on my nose and general T zone.. since beginning the use of these products I’ve noticed that my skin feels balanced. Highly recommend!"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Rich Hydration!,"I LOVE this rich moisturizer. It is thick and hydrating but not greasy at all. It stays on your face. It has a gorgeous, subtle glow that instantly gives a brighter look. It smells amazing. You only need a tiny bit compared to most moisturizers so you really get your money’s worth out of it."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,"This is a good rich moisturizer.  I like a heavier richer formula for nighttime use and this fits the bill.  I liked the C.E.O. Serum as well, but this smells even better and gives me a nice gloss. I have somewhat dry skin and live in an extremely dry climate.  I would not suggest for oil skin in a humid environment.  Overall… would recommend."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,heavy,"I liked it however it was very heavy, I ended up returning but may circle back to it as a winter cream."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Smells beautiful but it was too thick for me - even during the winter months and found the product went quickly.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Nope,Very greasy & heavy. Wasn’t good for me. Probably nice to wear in very cold climates or during tough winters.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Great vitamin C moisturizer for sensitive skin.,The best vitamin C moisturizer for sensitive skin. A little can go a long way. Sits on the skin for a bit and then my skin glows.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,Deeply moisturizing,"I love this cream. It’s thick, heavy and smells wonderful.  I have dry sensitive skin and it loves a deep skin drenching cream and this does just that. It’s perfect for a night cream, I use this with a few drops of the UFO clarifying oil at night and it’s the perfect combo. Subtle glow from the vitamin C in it also, which is a nice bonus.  I was new to Sunday Riley but after CEO and UFO I am now a forever costumer. Very expensive for a cream, especially the larger container, but that’s something I’ll have to deal with because I do love this product."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Malaysia,makes my skin look oil,"I am sure what to think of this one. I don't think it made any difference. Infact, it made my skin look even more oilier. May be not the right product for my skin which is oily-combo. NOT on my repurchase list. "
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Malaysia,Its ok ok,Not really suits my skin. Maybe because my skin cannot tolerate with vit c
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Nothing special for so much $$$,"Wanted to try this product cause of the great reviews and ""rich hydration"" in the title...it really is not very hydrating and doesn't do anything special otherwise. The jar was so ridiculously small for the price on top of that."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Malaysia,Love this Vit C cream !,Visible changes in my face after using for 3 days 🥰 simply love it ! The reason bought this product due to dull skin tone and pigmentation issues… felt so relieve after experiencing the outcome… will definitely repeat order !
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,"For me this is the best day cream, the only thing I add to it is Sun protection other than that this is so far the best skin care routine cream"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Not for oily skin,This product was way too thick for my oily skin and made me even more oily. It smells really nice but it felt really heavy on my skin and I had to take it off within an hour because I looked like I was starting to break out. The educational videos were great but the skin types they list are misleading.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Not very moisturizing for super dry skin,"I got the full size after I used a sample of this because I thought it was so good. It was not as great as I thought. The weather has made my skin super, super dry and this did not help. It felt like I had not put on any moisturizer. I dont know if it’s because it’s winter now & when I used the sample it was during the summer, but it really does not help. For the price, you would expect it to be better. I’ve had to use a hyaluronic serum to help keep moisture to my face and started using a diff moisturizer. Gave 3 stars bc maybe it works better during the summer than winter just because my skin does get really dry during winter months."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,broke out,Looked nice and glowy but broke me out terribly :(
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,Sits on top of the Skin,"This product is super thick and hard to blend in. I find myself pulling on my skin to blend it in. It doesn’t absorb properly and sits on top of the skin. It feels kind of sticky and wipes off super easy. For skin that dries out easily, I need a cream that stays ON all day, this just wasn’t it."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Don't Use in Sunlight or Tanning Beds!,"As a moisturizer, I dig it. It smells great and leaves your skin soft. But do not use if you will be exposed to the sunlight because citrusy essential oils are phototoxic and may cause skin irritation or dark spots. I'm a little surprised there was not a warning on the label. This would definitely be better as a night time cream, which is cool since orange is good for insomnia."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Malaysia,the best,Very Hydrating. Love the smell. My skin become plump after few times using it. Really recommend this. Worth the price . Will repeat the order. Loveeeeeeeeeeee it !
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,it’ll be a no for me,"I found this very heavily fragranced, and though it claims to be a hydrating cream I did not find that to be the case at all. The cream feels thick at first, then oily and then eventually sinks into the skin. The moisture doesn’t last and my skin was left with dry patches at the end of the day. Better vitamin C formulas are out there."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,"My skin still felt dry after using this and used twice daily, not as hydrating for my combo skin."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,"Dont buy it, it made me dark spots . Terrible product. I dont recommend it."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Singapore,CEO,"Tried some of Sunday Riley’s products but unfortunately this doesn’t sit well with me. It is sticky, tacky for my oily skin. Doesn’t feel comfy at all especially staying at a humid country"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Emphasis on RICH,This is a great wintertime moisturizer for dry skin. I don’t use it everyday because it’s rich and I feel like it builds up on my skin a bit. I love it for when I need a deep moisturizing. Smells great!
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,CANT LIVE WITHOUT!❤️❤️❤️,"I’ve used this for a few years in combination with good genes - to say that it’s moisturizes with a beautiful glow is an understatement!  I have received dozens of compliments on my skin -
Strangers comment on it and ask me what I use on my skin!  My sister is 16 years older than I am and let’s jus say we’re both over 50!!  She is very particular about her skincare and just recently finally tried the sunday Riley ceo moisturizer & good genes- the next morning she said her skin hadn’t felt so good in over 20 years!!  The results from one use of this power duo was enough to convince her to switch immediately over to Sunday Riley!  She’s been wearing it for about a month now and is obsessed!!  Different strokes (& brands) for diff folks- but as for me and my sister- we are fans for life!"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Totally love the product. Smells great and my skin feels so hydrated! Totally recommend for dry skin!
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,"Rich and Hydrating, as promised","Good product. This moisturizer is a great base for dewy makeup. My only complaint is that I cannot place this anywhere near my eyes because my eyes will tear all day long. Otherwise, great product and gets the job done."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,It’s a great moisturizer but it’s heavy ! It’s not for oily skin it made my skin much more oily :( but overall it is a great product but NOT for oily skin
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,feels sticky and heavy on skin,"This product was recommended to me by a Sephora associate . 
This cream feels very sticky and heavy on skin . Also it lasts for just a month if you are using this twice a day . I switched to tatcha dewy skin cream instead."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Hydrating but Greasy,"Hydrating but I stopped using as it’s supper thick and the greasy feeling lasted all day. Personally, I would only use this in the winter when the extra layer feels helpful against the wind."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Full of Antioxidants!! Love it!!,"I love love this Hydration Cream! I am a big fan of vitamin c. I am 50 years old and I like the fact that it makes my skin look brighter. I've talked about this anti aging moisturizer on my Youtube Channel ""NeeCJae"" Check it out!!"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,BEST PRODUCT EVER,"I absolutely love this product! At first I thought it would be greasy, but as I smoothed it into my skin and it finished ""drying"", it surprisingly left my skin feeling soft, NOT GREASY one bit and it actually lifted my spirits overall. The scent is wonderful, just gorgeous. the best way I can describe the scent is that of an orange creamsicle. It's not over powering or very long lasting, but just enough to brighten your mood, even if only for that moment in time. Even my boyfriend loves this! He has a hard time finding a moisturizer that goes through his beard, isn't greasy and actually feels moisturizing.. but he LOVES this! And a little bit goes a long way! Seriously, I only use about 4 finger dabs (maybe a nickel-quarter sized amount) for my entire face and neck. Start off small!! you don't need much! I've seen too many people try to use globs of it which of course will leave you with too much product which equals greasy"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,"I live for Sunday Riley C.E.O. products. They really work for my olive skin, post acne scarring and general brightness. I don't find this cream greasy, it dries pretty quickly, though, I wouldn't use this product as a replacement for any sort of Hyaluronic acid treatment. Many people I know can't stand the smell of this product so I don't recommend if you are ultra sensitive to smells."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Not so moisturizing,"I really wanted to love this because of how good it smells and how nice it feels. Unfortunately, it just doesn't give the hydration level I need for my dry, rosacea-having skin."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Best moisturizer I’ve ever used. I apply daily in my morning routine!
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,REALLY nice!!,Love this moisturizer!! I’m dry and on the sensitive side. I received a sample jar and noticed the softness of my skin almost immediately! Seems to absorb really well and does not leave me greasy. Also sits well under makeup. I’m very impressed! I like the type of vitamin c used in this product. Already purchasing the large size. I’ve tried MANY high end moisturizers sold at here at Sephora and by other companies! I will continue to explore more products by this company.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Great for Dry Skin,"Great moisturizer if you have dry skin, but mine is combination and it's just too heavy for me. It causes my skin to be greasy and break out."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,"wonderful for dry skin, let it soak in","I have dry skin and I live by this cream. It does feel oily at first, but as others mentioned, as soon as it “dries”/sinks in, it leaves you with hydrated and plump skin. I actually use it both AM and PM but recognize that for most people it’s probably more of a night cream. Since I’ve been working from home, I use it in the morning and let it soak in and follow up with my WFH makeup routine."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,"Bad for me, but not for everybody","I really wanted to love this product! My initial impressions were that it is very luscious, thick, and creamy. Great scent. And vitamin c! All wonderful attributes. Unfortunately, this just never seems to sink into my skin. Each time I apply it, no matter how much or how little I apply, it turns into a layer of grease on my skin. I spend the rest of the day walking around with the feeling of an uncomfortable oil slick on my face and neck. Eventually it starts to pill up. All in all not a good situation. 

Once I gave up on this product, I did give the other half of the container to my friend, who says it’s the best moisturizer she’s ever had. So maybe this is really specific to each person. Hence the 3 stars! 

For reference, I have very dry skin."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Buy it!,"Love this product! I’ve been using it for about 6 months now and I have noticed a visible difference in my skin. It’s brighter, more supple, and the light scent is a plus! Best of all, my hubby has noticed the difference in my skin and he’s starting to use it too. Love the applicator that comes with it!"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,It's okay,It smells nice but didn't do much for my skin. I used it daily and didn't really notice any change in my face or skin.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,thick hydrating cream,Love this! It’s a very thick and hydrating cream. I always come back to this after 1-2 other moisturizers in between. It absorbs well and completely hydrates.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,This cream is what it says it is...rich! Thick ‘ luxurious...you actually feel as though the product works immediately! Smells like oranges!
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,worth it,"I love this. Feels hydrating, not to thick and I notice my skin is brighter immediately after putting it on. I never leave the house without it. Smells great"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,"It is a nice moisturizer but didn’t notice any benefits of vitamin C, maybe I had to use it longer than a month. If I am only using it as moisturizer I would get First Aid Beauty Ultra repair cream instead"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,not a good product,"the container is big but very little product inside, it only last me a month, not very happy for the price I think I could of bought a better brand."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,lovely,"This is by far the most wonderful delicious stuff ever FYI i have very dry skin… why 4stars it’s pricy and the container is big but again (you’re paying for the bran and ingredients) we need to keep in mind… for me it’s worth it and its so delicious,rich and buttery i did see a difference i would recommend this only if you’re dry not convo, or oily Dry very dry"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Malaysia,Not for my skin ,please use a tester or sample before you purchase.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Malaysia,not the best product from Sunday Riley,"I love sunday riley’s products especially the water moisturiser but when I tried this, it broke me out. Thankfully I got the trial version. It did help hydrate my skin a little bit but I always had tiny bumps after using this."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,Perfect Hydration,I adore this cream. The texture is luxurious and feels like silk. I wake up feeling deep hydration that lasts the whole next day. Coming back for my second tub.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Smells nice and is very hydrating without being greasy.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,rich and occlusive,"Love it for mature skin. It’s rich and occlusive, just what the doctor ordered. The only downside is the steep price ;)"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Glow without the grease,"Overall, I really liked this. The main draw of this is that it's a THD moisturizer, which is a form of Vita C that I prefer. It is on the pricier side so I wouldn't say I loved it so much I'd pay regular price for this as I went through the 1.7oz jar in about a month. The consistency is super rich and luxurious but does not feel heavy or greasy on the skin. It absorbs quicker than other rich moisturizers I've used, and somehow felt mattifying but still gave my skin a really nice glow. Even by the end of the day, my face still felt hydrated and moisturized. It layers nicely over serum and toner and under sunscreen and makeup. The quick absorption makes it ideal for daytime.

Fragrance is a fresh, light orangy/citrus scent that doesn't really bother me like the citrus scent by Ole Henriksen. The packaging is high-quality and comes with a really nice spatula. Wish it had a magnetic component since the round end of the spatula makes it hard to store flat."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Malaysia,Nothing special ,This product SUNDAY RILEY - C.E.O.C + E ANTIOXIDANT PROTECT + REPAIR MOISTURIZER not suitable for me. My face become very worse and it is very expensive . Won’t buy it again.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,healthy looking skin again,"Since my skin care products from Korea run out, I needed a new cream for my daily routine. My skin looked really dry and dull. At Sephora I asked for something to make my skin look bright, healthy and moistured. I like it when the cream feels rich but and is quickly absorbed at the same time. This one really meets all my requirements, so I’m totally happy to have bought this one. Plus it also has a nice orange/citrus smell to it. Love it."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Malaysia,Sunday Riley,"Product smells funny. The colour also appears to have changed (not sure if it’s spoilt or this is normal) very pricey and you will only receive a small amount

Won’t recommend "
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,"I was a little skeptical about this product at first because I had never heard of it, but honestly I enjoyed my experience with it. I will say that if you are sensitive to fragranced products, this product is not for you. It heavily smells like oranges. Although, it has a creamy and thick texture that's great for dry or combination skin. It is kind of pricey so although I am saying it is a good product, I don't think it's life-changing."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Malaysia,luxurious cream,"It is true the orangey scent can be quite strong. I personally like the scent and it dissipates and doesn’t feel that overpowering after application so i am ok w it. As for the vit c effect, i have used better vit c serum that works better. So to me, this feels luxurious and an extra step for me "
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Horrible,I wanted to love this product so much. I’ve used it 3 times already and am ready to just throw it away. It has a pretty strong sent and leaves my face feeling greasy. Every time I’ve used it I have had to wipe my face after 30 minutes and the towel has looked like I poured grease on it. Would never buy again or recommend.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Malaysia,C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair,"I tested a small jar of this cream and pair it with Good Genes. It stings a bit during the first application.

In my honest opinion, the Vit C serum might be more suitable for less sensitive and dry skin as it really dries up the skin.

Tad disappointed."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Hard pass for anyone with dry or sensitive skin,"I love the Vitamin C serum from this brand so when I saw this cream on sale I was eager to try it. I’ve been using it for 3 weeks and I’ve noticed the following: 
- Extremely dry, peeling patches of skin have appeared in various parts of my face
- Red skin and itchiness where this cream is applied
- acne on my chin and cheeks where I’ve been using this product. 
- On my chest and neck where I’ve used this I’ve experienced itching/redness.

If you’ve got sensitive or dry skin this product is a hard no. I love the vitamin c serum but I would not recommend this product. Going back to YTTP’s moisturizer that doesn’t break me out or cause intense dryness."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Just okay,"Purchased the smaller size through HelloAva. I've been using for about a week, and think it's just okay. Not in love. This moisturizer is pretty heavy, and has a fairly sticky/tacky feeling that I don't enjoy. Can also give me a tingly feeling upon use (I have sensitive and dry-combo skin.) I now use this in the AM only, as my last step before SPF. 

Does leave skin feeling soft. However, I've used other moisturizers that I've loved more- I think I will buy a separate Vitamin C serum in conjunction with a tried and true moisturizer, once I use up the rest of this jar. It does smell like oranges, but the smell is like that of a very strong essential oil. Or like you just ate a Cutie, and didn't wash your hands afterwards. The Ole Henrikksen vitamin C products in comparison, have a delightful creamsicle scent that I prefer."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Loving it so far,"Can't give it 5 stars yet since I've only been using it for a week so don't know the longer term effects, but so far it's one of the most hydrating face lotions I've ever used and gives a light dewy glow to my otherwise dry skin. The smell is light and citrusy and I like it, even though I'm generally smell sensitive. I've been using this in the mornings (and retinol at night), and feeling like my search for a perfect combo might be over- for now."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,"Not worth $30. This is the smallest thing ever, kind of ridiculous they charge this much. Even if you don’t need a lot it still doesn’t last long"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,*Adds to basket...,"I’m new to skin care. However, now that I am in my early 30s I realized that I needed to start doing more.  I have relatively dry skin, especially in the winter months and I noticed that my skin tone was beginning to look dull. I’ve been using this for about a week now and my skin looks noticeably healthier, more supple, and dare I say, a bit of a GLOW. I would recommend giving it a try!"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Easy Way to Vitamin C,"I'm a fan of Sunday Riley products as I think that their ingredient lists are extensively thought out and cover multiple benefits in each. This came as a sample in my Best of Dermstore kit and I really enjoyed the consistency and luxurious feeling of it. I also made a purchase on Ulta for my twin sister as we are both in our 30's now and have never acquired high-end products. Of the many samples she received this was her favorite and she is buying a full size of it. I struggle more with acne and am targeting different problems than she is, while she has nice skin that could use the brightness boost, the hydration, and the protection offered in this cream. You can find so much information about their products and it's very consumer friendly. I think this is a really lovely Vitamin C cream that absorbs nicely and makes you want to keep using it."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,The price though?,"I do believe this to be an excellent moisturizer- I bought the small one to try, but I'm not sold on the price for repurchasing the lg one- I see a few comparable moisturizers that I will go onto trying next. I like the formula- its a little sticky but sinks in really well. The smell is quite strong but can overlook it. I'm very on the fence."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,C the difference,"I have another brand of vitamin c serum for many years . But this past year I discovered Sunday Riley Good Genes and fell in love . I have been adding new products and this was the latest addition .The C.E.O Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream  is absolutely the best C I have ever used. Fast absorbing , no greasy feel on face use this as my first layer under my Good Genes."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,"Absolutely obsessed! Loving the scent- literally smells like a creamsicle, and keeps my extremely dry skin feeling and looking hydrated! Cannot wait to buy more!"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Great for dry skin!,"I LOVE this cream! It’s perfect for dry winter skin, and like others have mentioned it has this lovely citrusy fragrance to it that is absolutely my favorite way to start the day.

The formula is fantastic, tons of vitamin c for tired or uneven skin.

I will say, it is probably best for dry or combination skin. It’s a very thick rich cream, I don’t think those with oily skin types would need this thick of a cream. But for those of us who suffer from dry skin, it’s amazing!"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Great hydration,"Smells like sunshine in a jar, love the skin brightness and the creaminess of the product...will buy again"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Malaysia,Repair skin,"This product is definitely my top choice!! Although the price is a bit expensive and the size is too small, but this product worth every penny!!! My skin getting better and my breakout was totally healed after few times apply this on my skin. It is smell nice too. I love this!!! "
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,"I like the scent of this cream, but it's a bit thick and hard to absorb into the skin."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,I am on my second jar. I tried a different moisturizer in between jars and had to return it because the glow was just not the same. I am in LOVE with this moisturizer!!! Will continue to use.
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,Beautiful product,"This is a beautiful moisturizer. The scent is present, smelling like oranges, but very natural. No synthetic notes.
It goes on your skin beautifully and when paired with the Sunday Riley Vitamin C serum, makes your skin have this revived luminescent look. I have more mature skin, and it does a wonderful job making my skin look and feel fresh and brand new."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Amazing!!!,So hydrating and really gives you a great glow! I actually sampled the vitamin C serum first but wanted to try it in the cream and bought it in the full size just hoping I’d love it and I do!! This is probably my favorite Sunday Riley product so far!!
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,Brilliant alternative to SR vitamin C serum,"I love this product! So, I got the Sunday Riley's vitamin C serum and I loved it because 1. it lightened and brightened my skin 2. it smelled amazing and 3. I had NO allergic reaction (I've had allergic reaction to 3 different vitamin c serums from sephora). The only problem with the serum is it's so damn expensive, so I decided to try this. It does all the same stuff for my skin as the serum with the added bonus of hydrating. It's also $20 cheaper and the tube is full, no skimping on product. I'm not a bougie skin care person, but I will happily pay 65 dollars for a product that completes my skincare routine and makes me glow."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Canada,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,"I’ve never purchased a moisturizer twice, I’m on my second jar and will continue to buy! It removed all of my hyperpigmentation and early signs of aging (I’m 36) within a couple of weeks. It smells good. Love love love."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Best moisturizer I’ve ever purchased. It feels like butter. It’s pricey but worth all my coins!
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Singapore,Researcher,"Helped to even my skin tone. Remove pigmentation on face. I was able to see results in 2weeks time. 
Smells good too.
Bit oily when worn alone but it is fine with the makeup on top."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,AMAZING SKIN,"This moisturizer is AMAZING. I've tried more than I can count (including La Mer) but this one has a very special quality to it. The baby soft texture it gives your face, all while...plumping, brightening, refreshing, and full on GLOWING is just crazy. The fresh citrus scent is to be expected from a vitamin C product and it's lovely. Absorbs very well and doesn't ""sit on"" your skin. Definitely one that can be worn under makeup or alone. The price point is pretty spot on considering what you're getting out of it, and what other quality moisturizers cost vs their benefits. It's also a good sized jar and a little goes a long way."
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,glowwww,"This is my second purchase of this product. Love that they now include a spatula. This cream is on the thicker side but skin looks hydrated, plump and healthy after using. I use both day and night and nothing compares. You wont regret purchasing this!"
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,Malaysia,glow ,"It’s good to try on for beginners. I used during my night, so it lasted for 2 months. Made my skin glow , smooth and pimple free. The smell of Vit c is so nice. Definitely will recommend this! "
SUNDAY RILEY-C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,USA,SUNDAY RILEY C.E.O. C + E Antioxidant Protect + Repair Moisturizer,I’m very impressed! It’s super rich and hydrating leave my skin feeling hydrated and looks great under my makeup definitely will repurchase again.
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,It saves my summer!!! The cooling sensation is very long-lasting
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,LOVE IT!!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product does everything it claims to do. I have rosacea and since using this moisturizer, it's not even noticeable! The texture is really pleasant, it's light and quickly absorbs into the skin. But it's still hydrating enough for my combination skin. The cooling effect is there but not very intense, I only feel it a little. I highly recommend this moisturizer and hope they will restock it!"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,Meh. Kind of a gimmick.,"It's ok. I love their face wash but their other products aren't impressing me. I feel like this is more of a gimmick with the cooling sensation. Nothing quite wrong with it, I would just pick other lotions over this one."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"Amazing. Feels great, absorbs quickly, leaves skin feeling refreshed. Just don’t put it on and then head out to cold temperatures… can’t wait to try it over the hot summer."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,the best cooling and refreshing moisturizer,"HOLY GRAIL. It’s cooling affect soothes my skin and feels perfect after a fresh wash. It calms down any irritation while helping my skin feel hydrated. The best thing after wearing makeup all day or after a makeup free day when I want to ease the stress on my skin. Highly recommend, especially after wearing a mask all day it’s very refreshing"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,"I never write reviews, but this deserves it!","I have been struggling with rosacea for 10 years (relatively mild compared to some, but enough that has really bothered me).  I had a noticeable difference within 2 days even though the “refreshing” feeling was almost too much for my sensitive skin. I really couldn’t believe it could hurt and be so good! It has given me back some confidence after being so self conscious about my pores and bumps, esp on forehead, after YEARS! I hope others have the success w this product that I had."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,Instant Relief,I absolutely love this product! I have eczema prone skin along with redness. The cooping agent in this lotion gave me instant relief from itchiness and the heat. I've just placed another order!
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"This product along with the wash and the peel help my skin to feel fresh and have brought my adult acne under control!

The lotion requires very little to make my skin tingle with a cool sensation.

Highly recommends his product!"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,"Lovely cooling sensation, but breaks me out","(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Cooling effect is very lovely and gentle (not quite the same as the stinging sensation of straight mint) but my skin broke out after using this for two days. I suspect it might be the mint derivative it mentions in the ingredients list, as nothing else there stands out to me as something sensitizing. The lotion texture was actually very nice and very lightweight. Considering I have oilier skin, this would probably have been fine for me."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,Not Moisturizing,I tried this as a sample in one of their kits.  It has a cooling affect.  I don't find that it was not moisturizing enough for me but may work for others.  I noticed that if you rub this onto your skin it will pill.  It works best if you dab it onto your skin as per instructions.
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,Cooling and light,Pairs great with their face wash (when used with cool water). Great for hot summers (this is so refreshing and cool) and the feeling lasts for a few minutes. It’s light and absorbs well.
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,"Love, love, love!!!!","My holy grail moisturizer! My skin was out of control for years and this finally calmed it down. I believe it’s absolutely worth the price because you don’t need to use as much as other moisturizers. The only thing is that it seems to be getting harder to get your hands on it, it’s never in stock and I haven’t been able to find it anywhere else."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,perfect cream,"Amazing, have been using it for years with the face wash as well, so refreshing and love the peppermint smell. Love the texture! I use it all year round, only need a little to cover face and neck!"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"This moisturizer is amazing! Feels great on rosacea skin too with the cooling. It also doesn’t cause any acne. It lost a star because of the container. While it’s a thick glass it’s still VERY FRAGILE. I knocked it onto its side on the counter and it cracked down the side a bit. It’s still usable but I put a scrunchie around it worried about any farther cracking making it unusable. I love this moisturizer but out of fear of cracking another bottle I will not replace it, and don’t think it’s worth the price."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,So soothing <3,"Very light cream, i though it would not be enough to fully hydrate my skin, but it works really well! After you apply, there is a cold feeling, it's veeeery soothing and i am obsessed!!"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I’ve been using this everyday for about a year now and I’ve noticed a huge difference in my skin! Absolutely love the cooling effect, and the way it makes my skin feel. Not greasy at all! Highly recommend."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) i love this product so much i have sensitive dehydrate skin with eczema issues, redness, and i've started to use this product for only 2 days and i already see a big difference. i recommend it at 100% with the facial cleanser!"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,"Sensitive skin, watch out!","(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I was really excited to try the benefits of kelp but I have extremely sensitive skin, while I can understand some people enjoy the cooling sensation it provides it just burns and my skin is red after application and for a while longer. I've tried it a few time and my skin didn't feel hydrated at all. Would not purchase product nor recommend for sensitive skin."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,Menopause Bonus,"I ordered this product from the reviews to help with Adult Acne.  Oh Yes, it does help with that.

The Major Bonus was discovering its other fantastic gift.  Having a Menopausal Hot Flash right as youre ready to apply your makeup (or half way finished) is so frustrating!  Wait for it to subside, drying off all the sweat, then having to stand by until your temp returns to normal - oh yeah - hate it!!

Well Fellow Menopausal Gals, I realized that applying this product as a primer 1st step, compleatly stops the heat from getting to your face.  The cooling factors keep my face cool for 15-30 minutes.  Its such an incredable discovery.  

For all those who know exactly what I mean, please try this out.  Its Really Life Changing."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,Great Moisturizer!,"I love this product! Great for sensitive, acne-prone skin. Leaves skin feeling refreshed and soothed after use; specifically a minty, tingly, cooling sensation. 

Before I started the use of this product, I had really bad fungal acne and sensitive, dehydrated skin. After use, I experience fewer breakouts, and have hydrated skin. 

Quick Tips I Use...
-Leave the moisturizer in fridge in order to maximize the cooling effect.
-Add water to the moisturizer when you're running low, it'll gel-ify."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,Try with caution!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I like the reduction of redness using this product, and it dried down quick. The thing I have am issue with is how strong the cooling affect is. I dont have sensitive skin but it started to burn a little once I put it on. That went away but the feeling is like putting toothpaste all over your face and letting it sit. The smell of the product is strong and I can smell it on my face. :("
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,rosacea who?,"I have facial rosacea, primarily on my cheeks. Since using this cream every morning and some nights I haven’t felt flushed or noticed any local redness that is typical for rosacea. It’s a lighter cream which is nice for wearing under makeup, however.. if you’re looking for primarily hydration I would suggest using another cream with this or getting a different cream entirely. For irritated, inflamed, flushed skin however.. I would HIGHLY recommend"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Singapore,Refreshing,"I have combination skin with oily t-zone. Recently, i suffered breakouts on my chin area. Was looking for a moisturizer and i happen to saw this product. This moisturizer is not oily on my skin and leaves my skin fresh and hydrated. Also, I love the refreshing scent of this moisturizer. Will definitely repurchase again."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Singapore,Soothing cooling effect,"I could certainly feel the cooling effect of this moisturiser. I've been using it in the mornings on my face and neck and the cooling feeling lasts for some time, it's quite nice. Not a super thick moisturiser so it leaves feeling quite balanced and fresh. "
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Singapore,ms,Cooling effect is very interesting particularly for hot weather. Love the tecture as well. Bought second bottle thus far. Will recommend to combination skin ladies or guys that are not used to uaing moisturizer. Good for day use.
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"I've been using this for a week both AM and PM. It seems to have reduced inflammation and redness quite well and has not broken me out. I wouldn't consider this a one and done product especially if you have dehydrated skin. It is however great if you love layer skincare products. I will say that when layering certain oil based or more moisturizing products over this, I've noticed small amounts of pilling, so it's best used as a last step product. Surprisingly it has helped reduce the appearance of my under eye fat pads and for that alone I'll likely repurchase!"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,Best redness reducer I’ve tried!,I have ordered almost every product Sephora carries that specifies redness reduction. This one has made a bigger difference after 2 days than any of the others did with weeks of use! It is INCREDIBLE.
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,My favourite face product!,"This is my 4th time re-purchasing, and it is still my favourite face lotion. I love depuffing products in general, and this is the best face one I've found! The tingling effect lasts for about 20 minutes after applying, and it really helps depuff my face (which I always have problems with). I hope this never gets discontinued!"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Singapore,Refreshing moisturizer,"I have really sensitive skin and this goes so well with my routine. Despite having a slight cooling sensation, it did not break me out. In fact, it’s super refreshing for a quick pick me up in the morning! "
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"Nice light moisturizer that I can even wear underneath makeup, love the minty fresh feeling too. Highly recommend!"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Very similar in texture to Kate Somerville's Wrinkle Warrior™ 2-in-1 Plumping Moisturizer + Serum (which is amazing!) for a fraction of a price. Good for combination/oily or even normal skin type... doubt it will provide enough hydration for dry skin.
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,"Nice, but a bit strong","I've used this lotion before - it is part of my summer routine as it has a cooling sensation in it and is also good for detoxing clogged summer pores. I find that this time, though, the minty cooling effect is stronger than in past purchases; it's a bit of a turn-off as it stings and takes a half hour to dissipate. Hydration is on the lighter side with this lotion. It is good for acne prone skin and reducing blemish inflammation. Worth a shot, but would consider alternating with another moisturizer for summer."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"I rarely review products but this lotion is fantastic! I love its texture, it's light and not greasy, quickly absorbed leaving the skin with a light tingling sensation. I have rosacea so finding something that works for my skin is hard, this lotion is perfect. Will definitely buy again."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,The Best,I have very sensitive skin. I stopped wearing face makeup due to my sensitivity. I’ve tried more lotions and serums than I can count and I always have bad reactions and breakouts. This is the first one that doesn’t cause a rash or irritate my skin. Very lightweight and hydrating. I use a dime size for my entire face and wow. This stuff is the best and I am a customer for life. I pair it with SKYN ICELAND Glacial Face Wash and my skin routine is forever changed. If you have sensitive skin like me go and purchase this you will not be disappointed and you here skin will love you.
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,Will be repurchasing,"I have been using this product for a few months now and I have never been so impressed with a moisturizer. My skin often goes through periods of being red and irritated and when that happens I use this product. You can really feel the tingling, cool sensation, and the scent is quite nice."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,LOVE LOVE!!,"I always use this after I am done using the facial wash! The cooling affect feels so nice on the skin, can definitely tell that it’s working! I always wake up with my skin looking refreshed! Highly recommend!!!"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Malaysia,cooling lotion,"I really enjoy using this lotion. It feels cooling on the skin which is a nice sensation when the skin feels stressed out. However, I'm confused whether it works as a moisturizer because I don't think it's moisturizing enough on its own for night time use if you have dry skin"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"Been using this for years, and it is a holy grail item. It does not break me out. Perfect balance for my skin type (extremes of dry and oily). The cooling effect is also a nice touch. No other day time moisturizer has come close to this one. I absolutely love it. I suggest it to all my friends!"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Singapore,good,I love the cool feeling on my skin and this is my second purchase.i have oily skin and large pore . I always apply before make up . This product will let my make up more long lasting and minimise the pore .
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Singapore, nice and cool feeling ,It leaves a nice cooling effect on my face and I loved it. My skin is dry and sometimes red. This lotion is great for me and most likely will re purchase again. 
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"I love the cooling feel, very refreshing... this definitely helped with my forehead lines and puffiness under my eyes! But don’t get it too close to your eye, the cooling effect made my eyes water."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"My skin is severely rosacea/acne-prone and this product by far worked the best, I love it... Used it for only 2 weeks and my skin tone is much more even and I don't see the bumps and redness on my cheeks like before. It has a bit sense of burning and tingling first but in a few minutes it cools the skin and is very calming."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,,must try,"I love this brand especially the cooling lotion keeps my skin hydrated And prevent breakouts... The Eye pad is the best! It’s give you cooling sensation and won’t drop off just stick on to The Eye area .. I can do my work, walk around with The Eye pad, so convenient "
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Love love love this. Hydrates without making your skin feel heavy or greasy. I have super dry skin and it doesn’t ever feel dry after using.
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,IF YOU WANT TO RUB THE POLAR ICE CAPS ON YOUR FACE,"I'm just going to let you know right now, if you're looking for a daily moisturizer to keep your dry skin moisturized, this ain't it. HOWEVER, if you want to feel the best feeling ever on your face in the morning to wake you up, you are going to put this on your eyelids your under eyes and your cheeks and bridge of your nose area and it is going to feel like you've spread Antarctica itself all over your face. Best feeling ever. It's especially great after a rave or music festival with friends. Does it moisturize your skin? Not in any noticeable or meaningful way whatsoever at all. Is it a fantastic experience? Absolutely omg. I've gone through a full bottle and I will be buying another one."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"I got it for Christmas with a gift card and I wish I didn't. Is this a moisturiser or a treatment lotion? It is not clear at all and it's also not very moisturizing. I need to put about 5 pumps on my face to feel that my face is moisturized and does not feel tight after washing. I am 38 years old with oily but clear skin and you would think this would provide enough moisture however it does not. I do not like the smell of this lotion and it does burn for a few seconds once the cooling feeling kicks in. I really don't think I would re-purchase this again. Maybe this is great for Nordic climates however it does not work with my skins genetic make up. My skin does not like it nor dislike it. It's just ok. I'm of 96% of Eastern European origin, 2% West Asian and 1% North African."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,,cooling ,This leaves a cooling and minty feeling on the face after application. But it doesn’t do much to moisturise. Redness doesn’t really reduce either. So It’s abit pricy for my taste. 
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,,THE CORRECT ANTIDOTE!! ,"First, I have few breakouts, dry skin and few tiny bumps over forehead. Been wearing it for a week & 1/2 and I've seen my skin transforming. My breakouts have perished, only remaining marks and dry skin no more! Smell just fine, I don't think they have fragrances. The cooling sensation tingles quite 20-30mins but I don't feel as tingling wearing it 4 days afterwards, just coolness. Worth the money. "
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,,love the cooling effect,"It so hard to find a super cooling cold or icy product . I need it this so badly . 
When days I’m lazy . This apply to my skins make my face having this very cold windy on my face . "
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"Imagine skiing in the Alps on a cool crisp winter day- well that's at least what this moisturizer feels like on your face. 
It smells minty fresh, and gives a bit of a tingly on your face. I love using it before shower and after face masks because it is so refreshing! 
Also my roommate keeps borrowing it and forgetting to give it back so I guess you could say it's pretty popular."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,Pretty good - cooling sensation is a bit much,"This is *almost* the right moisturizer for me. I have oily skin and I sometimes like to use products such as retinols, Vit C, and chemical exfoliants, which can leave my skin a little sensitive, so I wanted something to calm it. This usually does a pretty good job as it has a cooling, minty sensation; however, I noticed it stung the skin around my nose A LOT while using it when I had a cold (and thus had been blowing my nose all week). The cooling sensation was similarly a little bit too strong after I used a retinol recently.
As for hydration, it feels like it immediately quenches my skin but leaves little protection or hydration on the outer layer. Though it comes out of the tube in lotion form, it feels thin upon application - like water. I didn`t love the Tatcha water cream for the same reason. 
I`ve just tried the Saturday Skin waterfall glacier cream and am LOVING it -  a similar consistency to this one (light, hydrating, and fast-absorbing) but leaves my skin feeling plump and hydrated for a long time afterward.
Overall, the Skyn Cooling Daily Lotion is a good quality moisturizer but not right for me."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,Didn't seem very cooling,"I bought this to cool my face because I suffer from rosacea. It didn't irritate or burn my face, but it wasn't very cooling either. I won't be repurchasing this."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Feels amazingly refreshing on your skin. My face tends to get slightly red and this help even my skin tone.
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Canada,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) In love! Received this as a sample and I absolutely love the cooling sensation so much!!! I am definitely going to buy the larger size!!!
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"I have very sensitive combination skin, picked this up on a whim and I can't believe how effective it is. Redness is reduced, my skin is clear and balanced and the cooling sensation is really nice, away from the eye area."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,LOVE for my inflamed skin!,"I LOVE this moisturizer. I have acne-prone skin and sometimes it hurts. Not only does this moisturize but it cools my inflamed skin, making my day just a little bit better! I originally tried the REN moisturizer and went to buy it, but this was sitting beside it and I love this one so much more."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,It Burns!,"Not for my sensitive skin. Burned like crazy, had to wash it off right away. A really shame as I was looking forward to it. Recieved a sample, would not buy."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,im not a big fan of the mentol smell and feeling but this does make my skin look very good !! my acne scars are better and the gel is amazing for my very oily skin.
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"I'm torn about my review for this lotion. It didn't cause me to break out and fully absorbs in the skin making it a good option for me to wear under makeup. I don't mind the cooling feeling either, although some days my skin must have been more sensitive as the feeling was initially quite strong. So overall this is a decent lotion. But I didn't find it hydrating enough, even in summer, and I had to use a few pumps just to feel some moisturizing effect so I went through the bottle really fast. I will keep looking for a daytime lotion that works better for my skin. This might be a good option for really oily skin."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,irritating,This is very irritating and doesn't moisturize much.To claim that a product with menthone can soothe sensitive skin is just absurd. I got a sample of this in a set and I would've never bought it myself.
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,thank you JESUS,"long review warning! After reading the bomb reviews I bought this early February and lemme tell you the reviews AINT LYING!!! This is by far the best moisturizer I’ve ever used. I’m on acne meds, got a bunch of scarring, and red sensitive skin that gets super itchy. After 3 months of use day and night I can confirm this is extremely gentle and safe for sensitive and acne prone skin. Let me just note I’m only buying another bottle NOW like it can last you a good 3+months. My skin feels so soft after use, the texture/scarring on my cheeks and chin is going away, doesn’t make my face red or break me out, and when I do get a breakout with itchy pimples this does not irritate the pimples, it’s so cool and soothing. The texture is kinda weird it’s like a thick gel and took me a few days to get used to but I love it now. The ingredients are very clean as well as the smell it’s minty and lovely especially if you love mint and want your sinuses unclogged;) Only complaint would be it’s not the most moisturizing under makeup in my personal experience. Being on meds my skin is very dry and when I use this before makeup application my makeup clings to the dryness, so I always find myself applying A LOT before makeup. I also don’t use primer cuz my skin hates almost all of them so I only rely on this before makeup. Other than that I’m in love and wish I could give this more than 5 stars. I’m shocked this moisturizer isn’t more popular, super super underrated! Thank you Skyn Iceland <3"

SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,LOVE !,I LOVE this lotion! I first got it as a sample and couldn’t believe how amazing it felt so I bought the full size. The cooling effect you can definitely feel and it lasts quite a while. My skin is very oily when I wake up so I wash my face with ole heinrikson oil control face wash and then use this lotion. It has definitely calmed the redness down in my face and tightened my pores.
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,Very refreshing!,Very light and hydrating moisturizer. I love the cooling feeling that lasts about 20 minutes after application. This is a great moisturizer for sensitive skin.
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,"Great lotion, mixes well","Great lotion.  Cooling feeling going onto the skin which is lovely. I mix this with a BB cream for some SPF and a bit of colour and it mixes beautifully.  You don't need a lot, making it good value for the money.  I break out with every new thing I try but this didn't cause any issues for my light, sensitive and breakout prone skin."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,,Super cool!,"I've got sensitive, acne-prone skin that gets red easily if it gets too warm/cold. This moisturiser has been wonderful! I really love the cooling sensation which lingers for quite some time. Perfect for SG's weather. Also, I realised that my skin looks less red and irritated throughout the day and my blemishes look less angry. It's moisturising enough for my skin and gets absorbed quickly though it comes out pretty thick. Highly recommend this product!"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,Face-Saver,"I have always had pale skin that flushed easily and sometimes stayed red for a short time... but about a month ago I developed a raw red “rash” all over my face. The doctor said it was rosacea and prescribed me some cream... which made it SO much worse! My face was red and bumpy and extremely sore. I ditched the prescription and tried several other drug store creams with no luck. After a search on sephora.com, I found this SKYN product and figures it couldn’t hurt to try it.
Let me tell you, it feels amazing and cooling on irritated skin! Also, it may have been coincidence, but my skin irritation has cleared up since I started applying this cream twice daily."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,Great summer moisturizer,"I originally tried this as a sample when I placed an order online. It goes on smoothly and doesn't leave a sticky or heavy residue. Personally, I love the minty, tingly feeling...but I only use this as my summer moisturizer for that exact reason. Skyn Iceland is overall a great brand and I love that their products are clean!"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"great product,  very good for puffines"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,perfect for RED & SENSITIVE skin- amazing,"OK THIS PRODUCT IS DIVINE !!!
I have THE most SENSITIVE skin that’s breaks out & flares up at anything that isn’t clinical grade or high quality. After reading the reviews on how great this was for redness I decided to try this (after taking an antihistamine for a previous flare-up- ya I’m sensitive). This gel cream went on soooo smoothly & my redness lightened within minutes. The cooling feeling isn’t as intense as the reviews make it out to be, but it feels nice. It leaves a smooth, soft finish which was lovely. The only thing consumers should be cautioned of is that this product does contain retinol, but states apply am & pm- make sure you’re wearing your spf. Overall this product is the blessing after a very long trial of multiple creams.
I’m sold!!! Love!"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,Stressed Skin No More!,"There are not enough words in the English language to describe my love for this product. I love the way it feels on my skin - my skin feels happier when I put it on. The cooling effect is amazing. My skin is less red, less bumpy and less angry looking after consistent use. I will continue to buy this product because it is worth every penny! The smell is stronger than expected but it doesn’t bother me."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,refreshing af,Got a sample of this and I love it. It has a refreshing and long lasting cooling effect. I’d absolutely buy this.
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,Absolutely Amazing,"So my skin hates EVERYTHING, but this. The cooling sensation is fantastic and feels like you’ve stuck your face in a bowl of ice cubes. It’s helped soothe my redness and acne scarring. It’s not quite enough moisture to completely solve my extreme dry skin from acne product damage, but it is when I layer another product over in my problem areas. Also, it hasn’t broken me out and it’s been a week so I think I’m in the clear. Definitely give this a try if you’re at your whit’s end."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,"So, so good.",Amazing for my rosacea and not too greasy for oily skin. Keeps my cystic acne and acne rosacea under control. I can use it twice a day without problems - great under makeup.  One of the very few moisturizers I’ve finished a bottle of (my skin usually rebels after a week of two with anything else). Holy grail. Love.  Just wish this brand was carried in store near me. I’d love to try more from them but need samples first!
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"I’ve dealt with a red nose and cheeks for years now and I have seriously noticed an improvement after a week straight of using this product day and night. I have dry skin, so I have to use moisturizer on top of it, but it absorbs quickly. I actually find my makeup stays much better when I use this product under it! Highly recommend this product for people dealing with redness! Plus the cooling aspect feels super nice after a shower when my skin would usually be really red and hot."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Terrible for my rosacea skin. Especially if prone to pimples breakout.
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,I love the cooling sensation. It absorbs quickly and feels great
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,Great for acne prone and dry skin,"I have acne prone skin and use an acne treatment that really dries my skin and gives me redness. This is the only moisturizer that can appease the burning sensation because of the mint. Plus it is hydrating enough and it diminishes the redness. However, I would prefer if it was more natural."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,Skyn for the Win,"Love Love LOVE this stuff! If you have dry skin, acne, or rosacea you should really give this stuff a try. Works wonders on skin. I use it twice a day, morning and night after I was my face and my acne has improved significantly since I started using it. The only thing I don't like about the product is when it gets low, the pump doesn't work so you'll have unused product at the bottom that you won't be able to get out of the bottle. It's not a big deal but it's definitely annoying. Other than that I have no problems with this product."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,AMAZING.,"This lotion is life changing, it’s light so I reccomend a heavier one if you have very dry skin but together with DE Lala retro whip is a game changer."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,This product made my skin tingle and it feels like it’s stinging my skin .. not good for sensitive skin.  Also I thought since it was a “clean” product it would have no parfum ....
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,Holy Grail,"So so good! If you have red or stressed skin this is your new go to. It has a subtle peppermint scent that doesn’t linger but wakes your skin up (so I’d suggest using this during the day and not at night). It properly cools your skin for about 30 minutes so you can feel it working it’s magic. Trust me on this, you’ll love it."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,Skyn Iceland deserve to be talk about!,"I am surprised we don’t see more of this company on skincare bloggers posts. This is a great CLEAN ingredients skincare company. I have sensitive skin which is prone to clogged pores even tho my skin never feels oily. This lotion is hydration enough but I always start with a good serum. There’s a cooling feeling coming from the peppermint that last about one hour so you have to enjoy this to be able to appreciate the lotion. I enjoy it very much. The fragrance is light so the cooling effect is a bit surprising! After a week of using, skin is clear, hydrated and redness start to be controlled. No more red inflamed skin. I really think they deserve we start talking more about them!"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,love the cooling sensation!,"Wow I don’t even know where to begin! This stuff is amazing!
I have dry skin, when I get out of a warm or hot shower my skin is red and tight. I was using a water cream every morning after my shower but found it wasn’t doing enough to combat that dry right feeling. I tried this on a whim and glad I did. 

The product itself is very light weight, and feels amazing on my skin. It’s definitely has a cooling sensation that you feel immediately and wears off in a few minutes. Trust me that’s good. It also smells incredible

I have noticed since using this every morning my skin has been clear, the redness has gone away and it doesn’t feel right or dry after getting out of the shower. 

I still use my normal Fresh Toner and Oil in the evening and my skin is very happy with this added to my morning routing."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,Cool and Hydrating!,"Super cooling and amazing feeling, I find it feels best for me to use on my neck and jawline, and sometimes around my temples. Absolutely going to purchase the full size!"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,The Best!!!,"I️ absolutely love this lotion. I️ have very sensitive, dry, and often sore skin. This lotion is amazing, the cooling sensation feels lovely. I️t goes on really nicely, doesn’t irritate my skin (also doesn’t cause breakouts), and dries nicely matte, which feels great under makeup. I️ will definitely be repurchasing."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,Iceland is the best,"One of the only products I've tried that actually cools your skin, other brands say ""cooling"" whenever they add aloe, etc, in their products but this stuff is the real deal. The smell is amazing, feels like a fresh winter breeze on your skin, vegan too!"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,Real Deal Soothing,"This stuff is amazing! The cooling affect is real, it's like sticking your face in a freezer! I have really sensitive and irritated skin that's been breaking out like crazy lately. This day never clogs my pores or leaves a stinging or scratching feeling, it's just super soothing! 
If you have very dry skin (like me) you may need to supplement with another moisturizer on top or a tiny bit of facial oil."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,Love it!,"This product is absolutely amazing. I love using this at night after a long day, the cooling sensation and peppermint smell relaxes me and feels great on the skin. 
The only downfall would be that it isn't very moisturizing at all. 
However, I would definitely rebuy over and over again."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"absolutely love. received as a sample first and loved it so much I bought the full size. not greasy, gives a fantastic cooling feeling without being too much, and hasn't broken me out. very satisfied."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,Cooling and clearing,"I love this lotion, especially in the hot and humid summers. I have aging skin but still battle breakouts and pores and this keeps things in balance while refreshing my skin and not weighing it down. I bought the full-sized and like the travel kit to take the mini with me on trips."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,An actual miracle,This stuff is amazing.  I get some cystic acne during my time of the month and nothing has cleared it up faster than this (including prescription medication)! Works great for my regular pimples too.  Overall feels great on my skin and moisturizes well without being greasy!  Easily worth every penny.
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,"I highly recommend this product. I have fairly sensitive skin and have been dealing with a lot of acne which makes my skin patchy and red. I can confidently say when I added this to my skin care routine that my skin did decrease in redness and my skin feels less irritated. My skin feels so calm I debate not wearing makeup on top of it. Having sensitive skin, it is very rare for my skin not to break out when using a new product, so I was very pleasantly surprised when this did not make me break out!

On top of cooling my skin, it smells amazing and I love the packaging."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,great for morning and night and for sensitive acne prone skin.
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,Y'all ever want to get punched by mints? buy this,"This product is like getting punched in the face by a bag of scotch mints. they weren't kidding when they said 'cooling sensation'. as someone who does their skin care almost religiously, I have other mint products I use that are nowhere near as intense. after exfoliating and cleansing the lotion was borderline painful as it sunk into my skin. it's been great with helping the dryness and my skin has been looking healthier than ever. I would recommend to a friend, if only for them to be surprised at how 'cooling' this sucker is."
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,Sort of odd but this lotion is really helping me get through a common cold! The peppermint feeling and smell helps clear up my sinuses and it leaves my face feeling nice and cool. No burning up or using excessive amounts of tissues for me!
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,Love it!,"This feels amazing on the skin, it leaves a cooling feeling for a little while after you apply it. I haven't really noticed a difference in my skin after using this so I'm not sure I will re-purchase, but it definitely sinks into the skin and leaves your skin feeling soft!"
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,skyn Iceland The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,I really like this moisturizer and I will definitely repurchase when I’m done. I love the tingling sensation after I applied it. It soothes my skin and calms it down when it feels irritated. Sleek packaging too! Bonus!
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,12/10,This is everything I have ever wanted in a moisturizer. I would be extremely hard pressed to ever stray away from this!
SKYN ICELAND-The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion,USA,Game Changer,"I originally tried this product at a demo in Ulta, when I walked in looking sweaty, uncomfortable, and full of hives from an allergic reaction to my sunscreen while travelling down south. This is an actual godsend. The cooling sensation was heavenly, and my hives were soothed with the cooling effect. 

I was hesitant about the price, but my skin smelled so good, and was so soft for hours I knew I needed to take the leap. I ended up driving back to the local Sephora the next day and dropping $50 + taxes.

With oily skin, I usually go for La Roche Posay's Effaclar Mat moisturizer, but this bumps up to the top of my list. A little goes a long way, and keeps me feeling fresh faced and confident enough to handle the incoming summer heat!"
SKYN ICELAND-Oxygen Infusion Night Cream,Singapore,Ms,"I didn’t like this product.
It was not so good for my dry and sensitive skin. After using my skin was redness. 
The texture is too light for a night cream.

"

SKYN ICELAND-Oxygen Infusion Night Cream,Canada,skyn Iceland Oxygen Infusion Night Cream - 56g,"I've been using the while skyn Iceland line for a while now, and I still love this cream now just as much as I did when I first tried it. It's lightweight, feels nice going on and really improves the overall look and texture of my skin without leaving it greasy"
SKYN ICELAND-Oxygen Infusion Night Cream,Canada,Did nothing for dryness,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I tried a sample to combat some winter dryness and flakiness but woke up to no noticeable change in how dry my skin was. Pass!
SKYN ICELAND-Oxygen Infusion Night Cream,Canada,So soft and so smooth!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This left my skin so smooth and glowy after using it for just one night. I received it as a sample and am not really into the ‘day’ cream and ‘night’ cream rhetoric but I loved this so much that I plan to purchase the full size.
SKYN ICELAND-Oxygen Infusion Night Cream,Canada,Less than I was expecting,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received a sample packet of this with a Sephora purchase and I was expecting this to be a wonderful product because the claims sound very desirable.  Two nights may not be long enough to form a meaningful impression but I was disappointed to find that this wasn't very moisturizing at all - from the claims, I expected it to be re-energizing and wonderful.  I was also surprised that the ""glacial flower extract"" didn't stop this from smelling a bit unpleasant."
SKYN ICELAND-Oxygen Infusion Night Cream,Singapore,Not working,"Based on the ingredients, I would expect smtg from its but this is jz a normal night cream to me, no any difference after applying. this, too expensive "
SKYN ICELAND-Oxygen Infusion Night Cream,Canada,not quite sure,This cream smells like an antique gift shop. Not quite sure about whether it’s good or not as I can’t get past the smell.
SKYN ICELAND-Oxygen Infusion Night Cream,Canada,skyn Iceland Oxygen Infusion Night Cream - 56g,"Love this moisturizer! I find it a great weight with other products and one of few moisturizers that doesn’t cause a breakout. It has a light smell but I definitely wouldn’t say it’s a chemical smell, and I have a VERY good nose and have actually been violently ill from perfumes in the past. I also love that in my area, the packaging is totally recyclable, unlike many of my moisturizers which have a black plastic lid. I will certainly buy again!"
SKYN ICELAND-Oxygen Infusion Night Cream,Canada,MIRACLE,"I have bad adult acne and I swear this stuff heals it over night! It’s a heavy cream/lotion, the consistency of yogurt, but it doesn’t feel heavy. It’s seriously a life saver."
SKYN ICELAND-Oxygen Infusion Night Cream,USA,skyn Iceland Oxygen Infusion Night Cream - 56g,I love this night cream. It’s rich and very hydrating. Leaves my skin feeling soft and doesn’t irritate.
SKYN ICELAND-Oxygen Infusion Night Cream,Canada,Strong Chemical Smell,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product as a sample and I was so put off by the smell I had to give it a low rating. I give it a 2 star because I can’t see how it likely leaves skin moisturized, but the scent gave me such a headache before I went to sleep. I probably would not purchase this in the future."
SKYN ICELAND-Oxygen Infusion Night Cream,Canada,I loved this! face felt super soft and silky!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Got this as a sample and I love it. It’s got a lotion texture to it but a little goes a long way. My sample lasted me a week because I didn’t need to use all of it. It didn’t feel heavy or thick when put on and the feeling of your skin when you wake up... wow!! Like it’s heaven!! Suppppper soft and silky. Doesn’t make your skin oily or anything. Very nice night cream. I may have to use this in my routine!
SKYN ICELAND-Oxygen Infusion Night Cream,Canada,skyn Iceland Oxygen Infusion Night Cream - 56g,"I bought this cream on a whim, I like the texture and scent but wish it did more for fine lines and wrinkles, especially at this price point."
SKYN ICELAND-Oxygen Infusion Night Cream,Canada,skyn Iceland Oxygen Infusion Night Cream - 56g,Smells like paint. Still trying it out to see if I like it or not. But can’t get past the smell.
SKYN ICELAND-Oxygen Infusion Night Cream,USA,skyn Iceland Oxygen Infusion Night Cream - 56g,Leaves my skin very soft the next morning
SKYN ICELAND-Oxygen Infusion Night Cream,USA,Really good,I really like this cream. Hydrating for my combo skin
SKYN ICELAND-Oxygen Infusion Night Cream,USA,This product not for me,I do not care for the cream.  It is very runny and is more like lotion.  Has a chemically smell to it.  I like the Pure Cloud much better
GALLINÉE-Hydrating Face Cream,Singapore,like it very much ,"Less one star, coz it took some time for me to like it. Compared to other moisturisers, the hydration lasts for me. My makeup leveled up with just applying this and IT cosmetics cc cream. A little really goes a long way. Will definitely be getting a second tube. Also, as others have commented, there is a scent to it, slight vinegar scent. But its nothing too off putting. Recommend to try. "
GALLINÉE-Hydrating Face Cream,Singapore,mum loves it ,"I got this for my mum  she love it. Feels so light and hydrating, will definitely buy it again. This is worth it. Although it is pricey but I’m happy my mum loves it. Purchased 2nd Time"
GALLINÉE-Hydrating Face Cream,Singapore,does what it says ,"I’ve only used this a few times so far and no adverse reactions.  It’s hydrating, very lightweight and a little goes a long way.. 

My face looks luminous after usage too. I like that it doesn’t pile with other products that I use during the day.  However I find it’s a bit expensive for 30ml as most moisturisers are 50ml hence 1/2 star removed. 


"
GALLINÉE-Hydrating Face Cream,,amazing cream ,Excellent moisturiser. Really lightweight yet efficient. Tried in the sample kit and purchased the full size. The texture is great and there is no heavy scent to it. 
GALLINÉE-Hydrating Face Cream,,Moisturizing for sensitive skin,It really does its job by hydrating well. Skin looks better after few days. Good for sensitive skin. Skin feel more smoother. Use moderately to avoid oily feel.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Singapore,prefer the other series,"giving this range a try but for my dry and sensitive skin, I feel that the effect is the same per the blue series. Will not repurchase this but the other range. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Decent basic moisturizer,Good basic inexpensive moisturizer. Works as a basic summer moisturizer. Not a fan and did not keep using as it has a lot of silicone (dimethicone). Worked for me for a couple summers when I could not afford something safer and healthier for the skin.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Malaysia,moisturiser,Got this product during Sephora sale since my previous facial cleanser doesn't work so well on my skin. I really hope this product works because it is quite expensive 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Malaysia,Love the feeling of it on my skin!,"I love it! I have sensitive skin that is acne prone. It moisturise my skin, without making it feel greasy and light-weight. I feel like it makes my skin feel ‘balanced’ (not too dry, not oily). Will purchase again after mine finishes."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Really great product I’ve been eyeing it for a while to help my dry patches and wow. After the first use I noticed a difference. Let’s see how this holds up in the winter.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Malaysia,No cap on the bottle??????,"Received my order yesterday & there was no cap on the bottle. Pretty weird though. This is not the first time I'm buying from sephora online, so pretty sure something is wrong somewhere. Pretty dissapointed. 

please check on this team. 😔"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,awesome for oily skin!,This is the best I’ve ever tried for oily acne prone sensitive skin!! It absorbs quickly which I appreciate a lot as a male and has no scent which is also a plus!! It moisturizes enough but still feels light!! I will definitely purchase again! And will recommend to all my guy friends soo far everything I’ve tryed from first aid beauty is amazing!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,New Zealand,my dude stole this ,super basic product. nice but not really premium. 4here are other moisturizers that as this good for cheaper. I gave this to my dude since I needed something a bot more for myself. good basic moisture if you don't have skin issues like myself 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,My favorite moisturizer of all time great for my oily acne prone skin love it so much ❤️
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,"I love this lotion! I have blemish prone skin and this moisturizes without ever making my skin feel greasy or breakout. This has become my everyday moisturizer. It's perfect for summer, in winter I do sometimes combine this with a heavier moisturizer as needed."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Malaysia,for my husband,Got this for my husband as a starter to his skincare routine. He has been breaking out on his forehead after using but not sure if it’s the ingredients or just his skin getting used to all the self care. Lol
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Malaysia,Ms,"Bought this for my boyfriend who has no 
skincare routine at all because he wanted to start taking care of his youthfulness so i tell him to start moisturising (he washes his face with a drugstore facial wash/dish detergent/doesnt matter coz he will still have a good skin) so he was a moisturiser virgin. He feels ok wearing it for a first timer (it didnt give that theres-something-on-your-face feeling). It is creamy but not greasy, absorbs well and doesnt feel sticky/oily (obviously i tried it on myself too-oily comb skin). It’s a good all rounder moisturiser as it has ceramide and other antioxidants. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Malaysia,love it,"My skin normal to combination, and getting oily during the afternoon . This moisturiser really work well to my skin. I’m so happy. To be honest, it was so difficult to find a moisturiser that suit well into your skin.. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Singapore,too thick for the Singapore climate,Pricey for something does that not help your skin to feel better - it’s too thick for the tropical humid climate. Will not purchase again. The bottle comes in an easy dispensing way though.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Canada,Loved this product,I absolutely loved this face cream. It made my skin feel so much better and look better too and helped prevent breakouts and dark spots. So disappointed that First Aid Beauty discontinued it or Sephora Canada stopped carrying it.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Australia,Good moisturiser,"This is a good moisturiser, I also like the FAB repair cream. It's awesome when your skin is feeling hot and needs some calming. Nice light whipped texture, I actually prefer this to Drunk Elephant Whipped moisturiser. It wears beautifully under makeup. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,I have really sensitive/ acne prone skin and I really like this moisturizer. It’s definitely lightweight though so don’t buy this if you’re looking for something heavier. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is sometimes towards the end of the day I feel like my face gets a little oily.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Does not live up to it's claim,"I purchased this product because it's claim of oil-free, clean and ""healing"" brand ethos. I was, overall, very disappointed in the product and because I wanted it like it so much, it took me a couple of weeks to realize the damage it was causing to my skin. My skin hurt so badly and felt so tight. As soon as I switched back to the Farmacy green moisturizer I was using, my skin felt soothed and calm. It looked instantly better too.
My skin type: acne prone & oily from overcompensation due to dehydration
Pros: It's quite mattifying and goes on smoothly
Cons: Clogs pores & extremely drying! Even after putting the Lapis oil on from Herbivore, my skin would look really dull and dry. Wrinkles (which I don't even have that many) were more pronounced than I'd ever seen before. Because of the dryness, my skin started to crack in some places and breakout in others (mostly around chin area). I had worked really hard to get my skin clear and this set me back quite some time. I just want to cry when I look at my skin now.
Overall: if your skin is really oily and not acne-prone, you may like it. however, if your skin is anything like I've described as mine to be, I caution you."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Malaysia,good day moisturiser,Love using this as day moisturiser. Not greasy at all and it absorbed into the skin nicely without glowy finish so it is great for oily skin. Knock off 1 star because it can be not hydrating enough sometimes for dehydrated skin so need to prep skin properly. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,love it,Very light weight and very moisturizing and leaves a glass like looks that I think is very pretty. It is also great for sensitive skin
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Philippines,A good face cream,I can say that this is a food face cream. I have an oily skin and this doesn’t irritate my skin. Gives me right amount of moisture to keep my skin moisturize.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,OVERRATED,"I have combo/oily skin during the summer and thought the reason I am constantly having these small bumps on my forehead was due to hormonal, environment, eating, etc. BUT NO! It was this cream! I feel so stupid to find this out after I am 3/4 done with the bottle!!!
Overall:  
1 star off for after application not completely soaked in (even after exfoliation)
1 star off for leaving my face red and having small bumps
1 star off for bad packaging, the cream is pretty rich compare to its bottle's designed tube"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Crappy pump,The product is great; the pump system is awful. I have to constantly pound the bottle on the countertop to get the product to settle under the straw. Won't buy again due to this annoyance.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Singapore,Perfect light moisturiser ,"I have very sensitive, combination skin and this has been awesome for me. Been using it for a week as a day moisturiser (under make-up) and also after sheet masks - absolutely nothing to complain about. Doesn’t irritate my skin and feels nicer to use than the one I got from my facial salon. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Singapore,amazing ,"i like the texture of it, not to thick and is very moisturising. however, i feel that the packaging for this is not good because there are products stuck to the side and i have to dig it out. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Singapore,good,"i really like this air tight packaging as it is very hygienic to use and keep the product from the air! Thumb up for that. And this product has no smell and fragance as well, very good for sensitive skin!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,only moisturizer that hasn't given me cystic acne,"I have really dry acne prone skin which are two things that don't exactly mix well together. I have tried just about everything to balance the acne and dryness, and weirdly this is the only moisturizer that's done both so far! I really recommend trying if you get cystic hormonal acne!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Good! But let me tell you why it might not work!,"This works fantastically for me. I am so happy to have found it. The packaging, of course, is annoying. When you're down to your last 1/4 of the cream in the pump bottle, you end up having to unscrew the top and scoop out the rest. So that's annoying and encourages waste, in my opinion. But I'll go with it for a face cream that gives my skin that dewy, happy feeling. It's amazing. No clogged pores. No weird burning. Nothing!

However, I see a lot of people saying it didn't work or it just felt funny or it made their skin red. Here's the caveat with ""clean"" beauty products, y'all: plant ingredients. Just because something is a plant does NOT mean it cannot irritate you. I, for example, discovered I have an allergy to aloe vera. Aloe vera! That's got to be one of the most popular skincare ingredients, if not THE most popular ingredient, to come from a plant. You'll notice that this product has relatively few ingredients and therefore not many different plants in it. Lower denominator, less chance for allergy. That's why it worked for me, someone with terrible and varied allergies.

If you have a pollen allergy, it is VERY likely you have allergies to other plants. Compare products that haven't worked for you and see what ingredients they have in common."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Singapore,replaced my $110 cream with this,Ngl ive been using the tatcha water cream for awhile but it's painfully expensive so i decided to switch to this. i thought I'd see a noticeable difference and expected my skin to feel worse but it's like nothing changed at all. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,New Zealand,bland,"I got this because I wanted a no fuss moisturizer that wouldn't upset my skin and wouldn't be too heavy, and this definitely ticked the boxes. That said, it doesn't have much of a scent or interesting texture so I got bored of it when I started to get samples of other nicer moisturizers."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Singapore,good product but...,"The product is excellent. Moisturising but not too oily, keeps ur skin matte. Definitely ideal for oily skin. But because it’s ultra face cream has this... AMAZING texture and it’s also very moisturising without feeling heavy, I kinda don’t uds the unique selling point of this range. 

I believe it would be ideal for ppl who finds ultra cream still a little too heavy, and air cream too light, then this product would be an ultimate best for you. Hope this helps"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,"Worked well in the summer when my skin was not super dry, but would not recommend for fall/winter months. Seemed to dry my skin out even more."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,My sensitive skin loves this!,"I have very sensitive skin and this works great without any irritation, even around my eyes. I love it. I wish I could find a formula with a sunscreen that doesn't irritate my skin/eyes. But this is a winner."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Canada,bad packaging,"loved the cream but the packaging leaves a third of the cream in the bottle, you you have to pound out the rest and that's why I'm not going to repurchase :("
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Canada,First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,"It's not a bad product and it is reasonably priced, however there's nothing special about it. I have oily acne skin and it helped keep it moisturized without being irritating. I feel this is comparable to a good drugstore face cream though"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Good basic moisturizer,"Great for my combo/dry acne prone skin. I keep going back to this moisturizer even after trying other products, so far I’ve gone through 5 bottles (I wish it was slightly bigger lol). I do sometimes feel like I need a bit more moisture, so I’ll often mix in a few drops of rosehip seed oil or something similar (especially at night). It’s never added to or irritated my acne which can be hard to find!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Meh...maybe pass on it,The packaging is cheap and the moisturizer is subpar at best. First Aid Beauty has better moisturizers than this in my opinion. The pump is not great as well and a lot of product is left in the container that the pump is unable to get out. The moisturizer doesn't have a fragrance which is nice.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,A holy grail!,I was dealing with some milia bumps around my face that wouldn’t go away but this moisturizer helped clear them up. It leaves my skin glowing when I put it on and keeps me moisturized all day without feeling greasy or like there’s stuff on my face. My skin loves this!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,,No hygiene protection ,The First Aid Beauty moisturiser did not come sealed or with any box or any other form of hygiene protection. Is this how all FAB products are shipped? Disappointed with the lack of concern for product integrity. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,,A great moisturiser,I love thiss moisturiser as it hydrates my face while not being too thick. It also doesnt cause any breakout to my skin! Would repurchase it if I run out of it one day :)
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Canada,First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,"Most of First Aid Beauty’s products are really good, but this is probably one of the best I have tried from them so far. I really saw my skin smoothe out, and the colour even out. There is also no fragrance."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Disappointment,This was honestly not moisturizing enough for my face. The cream felt very thin (?) and seemed like a cheap lotion you'd get at those pharmacy/Walmart stores. Definitely not what I was expecting from FAB.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,awesomeness!!,I ran into this bottle at Marshalls’s store and for $7.99 I thought hey I will try it. Wow! I have oily skin with hormonal breakouts here and there and this stuff has not made me more oily and that is my biggest challenge when buying moisturizers is that I tend to get more oily and breakouts. Ive been trying to go back to to see if I am lucky to get more for that price but hey I’m willing to buy it here at Sephora (which I already did) because it’s been what I have been looking for. Wish the company will make bigger bottles but even though it’s small bottle I don’t have to use a lot.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Canada,Love it,"Absolutely in love with this moisturizer. I have oily skin so I hate when I use a moisturizer on my face and it feels sticky and thick, but this one doesn’t do that! It absorbs into your skin almost instantly and doesn’t leave it shiny or sticky. The only thing I’m not a fan of is it absorbs so fast that you have to be really quick when you put it on. But other than that, it’s amazing :)"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Canada,Love it!,Like this cream because its vegan and not tested on animals and it still smells good! Hopefully this helps rehydrate my acne prone skin!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,this product is wonderful,I have acne prone skin so I was looking for something moisturizing that wouldn’t inflame my acne. This product delivered! It goes on super smooth and doesn’t leave a residue and absorbs quickly. It doesn’t feel heavy on my face and it’s very gentle. Completely recommend!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Canada,Great Moisturizer,It’s really good. It doesn’t cost breakouts for me. My skin was never irritated and it helps avoid skin oiliness
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,,"Light, hydrating and gentle","This is a really nice non-irritating and effective moisturiser. It’s been great on my sensitive skin, even when it’s been irritated by other products. In addition to this, the price is excellent!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,,Good for dry skin,"Highly recommonded this product, Bagus untuk orang yang kulit kering, terutama kat area hidung.                                                              



                      "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,"This lotion can be used daily (night and day). It is light- but still works! I often get very dry and scaly skin during the winter months. However, this keeps me feeling smooth and hydrated all day long."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,Canada,Great for Extremely Oily Skin,"I got this for my husband who has extremely oily skin but also dehydrated skin. He has never wanted to put anything on his face out of fear of triggering his cystic acne. He actually likes this moisturizer. It is very gentle, has few ingredients, and dimethicone is low on the list (one of his acne triggers). With a combination of the FAB cleanser and this moisturizer his dehydration has improved without causing any acne."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Great for my oily & acne-prone skin!,"I bought this moisturizer because it is on the more affordable side of Sephora moisturizers.
The first time I used this, I followed my routine as normal (very simple-Caudalie Vinopure Pore Puriyfing Gel cleanser when I shower at night, followed by this moisturizer) and the next morning, I noticed immediate relief of the chronic redness I have on my T-zone and softer skin.

During the day, my skin wouldn't become as greasy. I am positive this product helped regulate/calm my sebum production.

Using once daily on my face and neck, one bottle lasted me around 2 months. It has a light texture, so it may not be enough moisture for those with dry skin, but is a supple amount for those with oily skin. It has not clogged my pores or caused any adverse irritation.

I am very satisfied with this product and will be purchasing another bottle soon!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,,effective moisturizer,I've been using clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel for my oily to combination skin and tried this one as a cheaper alternative. It certainly did not fail my expectation. This product moisturizes skin without the greasy feeling. It also does not break me out. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,,Creamy Goodness,"Very creamy luxurious feeing cream, its heavy and rich. A little bit rich for me for everyday use but if you've really dry skin it would be good. Would buy it again "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,,it’s okay ,Reasonable moisturiser. Did an okay job. Not sure I actually finished the bottle before moving onto something else. No real faults but nothing stand out. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Great product and price!,I'm in love with First aid skin care products. I've only been using this for two weeks and I've noticed a small reduction in hyperpigmentation on my face. I've had these marks for over 3-4 years and never seen a change untill now! For $22 this will forever be my go to skin care product!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,I need a hero.,"This product was so overrated. I bought on the reviews merits alone. The “green” factor was another pro. I have eczema on my face, and while I find the product to work best fresh out of the shower, I have to apply several times a day. It’s a very small bottle for the price. If you had a light case of dry skin this could be the miracle moisturizer of your life. If you have really dry and flaky spots, I would not rely on one application. I had such high hopes. I gave it one less star for giving false hope. I don’t recommend for super dry skin, and I can’t give an honest review for anyone with different skin concerns."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,,not bad,"the product is not bad so far after trying it for a few weeks, it does its job and it’s not oily and is absorbed by my skin almost immediately, my skin is no longer super oily but has a subtle glow throughout the day. however, i realized that after using with my toner, certain parts or my skin feel spicy and starts tingling so i’m not sure if it’s fully compatible with my skin or the toner i’m using. will definitely buy again once i’m sure it’s compatible with my skin type"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,,must have moisturiser ,Such a great moisturiser leaves skin super smooth ! Absolute must have in my skincare routine. Totally gets rid of any dry patches without making skin oily 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Love love love,"I have used this product for almost 5 years now. I recently tried a new, much more expensive face cream because I thought it was maybe time for a change. It most definitely wasn’t. I have super sensitive skin and this stuff works. It’s beyond amazing! Has kept me from aging and breaking out! All while keeping my skin perfectly hydrated. I have dryness in some spots and extreme oiliness in others. It somehow knows what to do where. I LOVE this stuff!! Under makeup or just slathered on before bed. It’s absolutely perfect!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,,love it!,"I have been using FAB’s products for quite some time already and decided to give this a try. I was pleasantly surprised - it does not give any sticky residue and I felt that it indeed locked moisture in my skin. I use this in the day, as a base under all of my makeup and it allows my makeup to last longer. Definitely would recommend!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,,Lightweight moisturiser ,"This is lightweight, absorbs fast and to my surprise, a little goes a long way! Great for sensitive skin too. A little on the expensive side but definitely repurchasing! "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,,M,This is so beautiful!!! So good and wonderful!! 11 out 10 recommended! Can’t tell enough how I love love this product. I will keep purchase FAB’s other product and try all of them
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,It's okay,"I have combo skin but it is more oily than anything. I occasionally get dry patches and flakes on my nose. I bought this specifically for my dry patch days, something that was also oil free. It helps when my skin is feeling tight but it doesn't help when my skin is flaking."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,,nice,"I have acne prone skin, and this stuff is amazing! Moisturise my skin really well. Lightweight and does an amazing job of balancing my skin without causing breakouts. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Normalcy.....at last,"I have comb oily skin and if it wasn't for FAB I'd still be using drugstore products that irritate my skin and caused breakouts. I realize everyone's skin is different and reacts differently but for me, I can't us frugal products because the ingredients are so harsh.

And my other huge mistake was that I listened to the preaching of Paula Begon, and that line of products was breaking me out too and causing sensitivity and redness. The worst part was, I kept thinking, “that’s just how my skin is”. And I would be constantly looking for things that would only take care of the symptoms and the results were always short lived.
The first night I stopped using all that garbage and started with this cream and even the Ultra repair cream I woke up with smooth and *gasp* glowing skin. There was no excess oiliness. And when I just used the skin rescue cream, it completely normalized all zones of my face. There was no excess moisture, no excess shine, just a smooth and very slight almost unnoticeable satin finish to the skin. 

And the breakouts I had from the bad products were gone and the few I had are healing quickly. 

I am so thankful  to the Arden Fair Makeup Artists for their expert advice."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,,Silky soft on my skin,"I chanced upon this product because I'm pregnant and may go-to HG drug store moisturizer has some paraben on it so I so say buhbye to it for a while.I know FAB is a great brand so I said ""yeah why not give this a try?!"" and boy it did not disappoint!I love it and considering on repurchasing it once I run out of this!It feels so silky soft on my skin and the ingredients are pregnancy safe!It never broke me out given I react easily to new products that I try!LOVE THIS!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Nice Every Day Moisturizer,Light weight and hydrating for dry skin. Nice for everyday use. I'd prefer a bit more hydration during winter though.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,,My love as day cream!!!,"I will definitely give this cream a five-star as I really love it!! I have finished three bottles of it. When I used the first one, I immediately bought another two, one for myself and the other for my BFF. The texture for this cream is really smoothy for a combination skin with no oily reflection on my face. And it is suitable for all my serum. I love it for its texture and hydration for a day cream. Will buy again..."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,,recommend ,I like it! I’m oily skin. It can moisturize very well and not sticky at all. The price is ok. It doesn’t have strange smell and can relieve skin stress. I recommend it 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,,"Perfect for combination, acne-prone skin",I've been using this moisturizer for more than two years. This product is lightweight and has done a great job of balancing my skin without causing breakouts. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Best Moisturizer!,THE BEST! I have oily/combo skin and hate that oily feel many moisturizers give me but this is absolutely amazing! Worth every single penny!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,"Wonderful, but expensive","I have combination skin and i like how this moisturizer feels lightweight and absorbs nicely. It doesn't make me feel greasy or too dry. I find that its versatile enough to use all year round. The only reason why it isn't rated a 5 is the price. $30 is pretty expensive for such a small bottle of moisturizer. However, I have repurchased it so i guess you get what you pay for. Wonderful product, but somewhat expensive."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,I have been using this for approx 2 years and it does not make my acne prone skin break out! It is great for the summer but in the winter its a little too light so i use a tiny bit of coconut oil in the parts I get dry
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,My son loves it! It has really helped clean up his face
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Didn't love,"I didn't love this as much as I love the regular moisturizer, I wanted to though! It made me break out which is rare for First Aid Beauty products."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,An everyday must,"Always a go to for day time moisturizer, light weight and absorbs easily. I have very sensitive skin and this doesn’t cause a reaction at all"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,"It gets into the skin fast but it left mine super dry. Not made for combination or normal skin, only oily!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,"Good. Basic, but good.","Basic face moisturizer for people with Normal-Oily skin. I used it for a while (about 3-4 purchases) and it was good, but it didn't do anything for my pores and that's something I wanted. Still a good product if you have a basic oil free moisturizer."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,lovelovelove!!!,I think it’s one of the best face creams I used!! It’s very light and non greasy. Didn’t break out when I first started using. 10/10 would recommend!!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,"Great for sensitive, acne prone and hyperpigmentat","I bought this for my 28 yr. old sister who works over nights and never uses moisturizer. she cleanses her faces (and in my opinion is over exfoliating) so I explained that she needs to protect her skin with moisturizer.  She has sensitive skin, prone to acne and hyper pigmentation. a week after using this she sent me videos of her beautiful, clear, and bright complexion.  She couldn't believe how great her skin looked because she has never had clear skin as an adult.  The results were truly striking."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,You'll fall in LOVE,"I have oily/combo skin. I absolutely am *obsessed* with this moisturizer! I use it every morning. It makes my face feel so good/smooth, and my makeup goes on so well. When i have tried using other moisturizers, I can tell a huge difference with how my makeup applies/sets when i don't use it.  and when i come home after work"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,bon rapport qualité-prix,"très bon produit pour le prix! laisse la peau fraîche et bien hydrater, aucunement collant. juste après quelques jours d'utilisation je vois une différence dans l’apparence de ma peau!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,My fav creamy moisturizer,"Love love love it!
Doesn't break my skin out at all nor does it make breakouts worse.
Does a great job with my combination skin"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,"Great for my oily, yet dehydrated skin!","I never used a moisturizer because I have oily skin and I thought I didn't need it. Of course my skin was dehydrated even though I have an oily skin type. This helped replenish the moisture to my skin, without making my face oily. I use this with their Skin Rescue Deep Cleanser with Red Clay and they work perfectly together!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,wonderful moisturizer for acne,i give this moisturizer a 5 star. :) My skin feels soo flawless after putting it on. It suits my combo. skin acne prone problem.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,"Textured skin, weird feeling on when applying","I have oily, acne prone skin and when I purchased this product my skin was at its worse. I purchased it because the bottle said it was oil free and non-comedogenic, which is what I felt I needed. Firstly, this doesn't feel nice on the skin. It doesn't make your skin feel supple or smooth or even hydrated. It kind of felt tight as I would apply it. Also, while I was using this product my congested skin (closed comedones and just a lot of texture) were horrible and when I finally decided to stop using this product, my skin got better. I'm confused however because the product is labeled as non-comedogenic. Also, my makeup didn't apply well over it. In conclusion, this might have been the worst moisturizer I ever tried and I honestly would never recommend it (at least for individuals with my skin type)"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,works good as a moisturizer for after you wash your face. good for oily acne prone skin. would use under makeup
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Amazing,"I am very picky with facial moisturizers. This is without a doubt the best moisturizer I have ever used. I will never use anything else. Does not break me out and is so moisturizing, yet feels light."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,"Almost perfect. Keeps my face moisturized all day, goes great under makeup, and doesn’t cause breakouts. Perfect for sensitive skin. The only complaint I have is the pump bottle- there’s always extra in the bottle that the pump can’t reach, so I have to make an extra effort to not waste anything."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Perfect lightweight moisturizer,"This is such a BASIC face cream in that it is just what you need -- not greasy, doesn't break me out, soaks in quickly, mixes well with BB Cream or foundation, can use it morning and night.  You could probably find something similar for less, but this is my third time purchasing and I'd rather stick to a product that I know works well and doesn't give me blemishes."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,"Great for Sensitive, Combo-Oily Skin","I have combo-oily skin that is very sensitive (I often break out, experience burning/redness, etc.). This is a great lightweight moisturizer. I pair it with the FAB Ultra Repair Hydrating Serum. It absorbs quickly and doesn't add to my oily spots. My makeup also applies smoothly. I agree with other reviewers that this is a fairly basic moisturizer, but it's great if you have sensitive skin but can't handle the heavier Ultra Repair moisturizers."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,"This product is highly recommended. I apply this to my face every morning and evening. After several days of using it, my skin is clear. It's really good for sensitive skin and this product is very light."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,"Decent, but nothing special","Nothing special about this moisturizer. Fragrance free is great for sensitive skin but other than that, its just okay. It's not super moisturizing, but it does the job. Def not for dry skin though"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,"I got this for my dad and it was great!  His skin is extremely oily with lots of pores, and after using the red clay cleanser I made him use this lotion to keep his skin hydrated.  After using it for some time, he told me his skin did feel much smoother."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Love,Lightweight and effective
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,"Great product, light and great for oily skin"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Maybe better for oily skin,"This is my first bottle and I’m almost finished. Won’t be repurchasing as I’ve used better products. I found this product to be good for my tzone, not so much for my dryer areas or around the eyes. I use it in combination with a sunscreen that I’ve used for years and it gets really thick on the skin and doesn’t fully absorb. Might just be the mixing of the two but I never had a problem with other moisturizers and this sunscreen. It might be better for nighttime or if you have oily skin without the combination skin like myself."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,Trust It,"I have been searching for a new face cream for quite a while now but was skeptical about anything new -- especially since my skin can be pretty sensitive. 

I was using a drugstore face cream and it just made my already oily face even more oily! Finally decided to purchase this cream about a month ago and my skin is much more improved! Oil is no longer seeping through my pores and my skin as a nice glow now. 

I'm also using their red clay mask once a week so I think that in combination with this is helping the skin on my face look more smooth, fresh, and I have not had any breakouts since!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,USA,First Aid Beauty Skin Rescue Daily Face Cream,This works well for me.
WEI-Royal Ming Imperial Lotion Moisturiser,Singapore,Liking it more & more,"First time purchasing something without feeling its texture on my hand, especially for this price tag. Smell decent...
Total oily skin I have & this is nice for quick absorption & no oily feeling at all post application. Does what it is supposed to do, moisture. "
SULWHASOO-Essential Balancing Emulsion EX Moisturiser,Singapore,Essential Balancing Emulsion EX Moisturiser,I bought because of Actress Song Hye-kyo because me & she are same age. After used it my skin feel very comfortable and not sticky on my face like others. Love it and will buy after finish it.
SULWHASOO-Essential Balancing Emulsion EX Moisturiser,Malaysia,this works wonders,i just love love love this products but i have to reapply a few times per day bcs i have very dry dehydrated eczema prone skin. i hate that it has alcohol and fragrance in it. but its a holy grail for me. ive been trying to look for a new moisturizer as good as this one without alcohol and fragrance but still haven’t found it yet. it makes me wonder how it works for my skin type when there’s alcohol in it. but its good and it smells good. all the ingredients are amazing except for the alcohol and fragrance   
SULWHASOO-Essential Balancing Emulsion EX Moisturiser,Singapore,definitely a no,"Doesn’t bring any smoothness or moisture to to my dry skin. The bottle packaging is not only heavy and bulky, but it is also not consumer-friendly as u can’t see how much that is left in the bottle. Not to say, it is difficult to pour. What a total disappointment. "
SULWHASOO-Essential Balancing Emulsion EX Moisturiser,Singapore,Sulwhasoo's products are the holy grail,Sulwhasoo's products really give your face the glow that you see on Korean celebrities' faces. Pair this with the first care activating serum and the ginseng serum and it works wonders.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,Singapore,Never goes wrong ,"I have been using this product many years and still love it sooo much.
The texture of cream is light an soft, easy to absorb. The smell is nice as well."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,Singapore,My fav,Actually used Origins product several years ago and thought it worked well for me. After a while was tempted to try other brands that friends were raving about. However i still find myself coming back to this moisturiser. It’s hydrating but doesn’t feel sticky and heavy. I like the gel-like texture and prefer it over the heavy cream ones
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,Singapore,great,"This has always been on the repeated buy list. Product is lightweight, absorbs readily into the skin, and has a calming scent. Good for day time use as it doesn’t cause the skin to have too much of the mid-day shine"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,Singapore,"Lovely smell, moisturising, light weight",I have very sensitive skin so this light weight gel moisturiser was perfect for me. It was also very moisturising without the greasy feeling. Would recommend this for oily/sensitive skin! Has a lovely smell too.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,Malaysia,Where’s the magic?,"My skin type is oily. This used to be my holy grail when my skin got really dry in winter. Immediately moistures my skin. But now I’m back in my tropical home country, I noticed my skin getting dry patches. I applied this as moisturiser for night time only. Don’t know what went wrong. Is it not suitable for oily skin? This cream is quite pricey. Where did the magic gone?"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,Singapore,oily skin bff,"After trying so many different brands, i finally found the one which suits my skin to a tee. I've been using this for years now, and recently added the ginzing into my routine as well. The results, clearer & supple skin without excess oil!!! "
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,Malaysia,works ,My mom has been using this for a year now and she loves it. She says it helps her dry skin a lot and reduces the pores on her face. Definitely a favourite for her.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,Singapore,Oily skin Saviour,"I have never tried a moisturiser better than this one for oily skin that hydrated and repairs the skin at the same time! Does not make me super oily at all throughout the entire day, very lightweight yet powerful! My skin feels super soft after washing it at the end of the day and the only product I changed in my routine was this. Gives you a really nice glow."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,Malaysia,Fav moisturizer,"was contemplating for a long time because of the price. I have oily skin and so far it doesnt exacerbate my oil production. a little goes a long long way unlike most gel formulas that seem to evaporate into thin air, probably because of the water based formulation. Its easily absorbed so I can use it every morning before my sun block, primer and makeup. love the packaging n scent"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,Singapore,Did not make a difference,"Did not see any difference to skin after going through a tub. Skin was hydrated but not much else. Expensive for what it is and it is heavily perfumed. I enjoy some mlid scents in my skincare products for the overall skincare pampering experience, but this was too strongly scented."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,Singapore,This is amazing~,"An amazing moisturizer, especially for dry skin (my skin is as dry as sahara desert). It smells good, moderate absorption and not too greasy. But I’m giving 1 star less for its pricing."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,Malaysia,Great product,I've been using this product for quite some time now and I absolutely loved it. It dries quickly and prevents my skin from getting oily. Would recommend this to others. 
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,Malaysia,definitely worth repurchase,Love this light and no oil type of gel moisturiser as it really helps on my combinational skin type to avoid being too oily. I bought trial size for first bottle and fell in love and is going to reorder again!
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,Singapore,Thick gel,"It's a thick gel consistency. But it absorbs well, slightly sticky. Has a nice citrusy smell. Doesn't irritate. But don't know if it really helps hydrate. "
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,,LOVE ,My only repeat purchase for moisturizer after 2 years. Really love the gel like texture and smell... really relaxing... very hydrating as well and it doesn't cause breakouts to me. 
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,,Great product once again!,"I love Origins and got this together with this ginzing moisturizer to use it during the day while this during the night. Both is great! 
The downside is.....the price keeps on increasing. Not repurchasing solely cause of the increased price year on year."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,,Love it!,Smells really relaxing & soothing upon application. I have oily skin and this works wonderfully on me whenever my skin feels dehydrated and needs an extra boost of hydration. The gel texture melts instantly into my skin and doesn’t feel greasy at all. 10/10 would repurchase.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,,Great product for my skin,This product is great for dehydrated skin. Like the texture and very pleasant fragrance. Personally feel that is more suitable for oily combination skin type.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,ok but not great,"I wanted a gel moisturizer for the summer months and this got the job done but it didn’t seem to soak into my skin well. I used it in the AM and PM but when I would wake up in the morning, I felt like I had a film on my skin and I couldn’t wait to wash my face. Once the weather changed slightly from summer to fall, my skin definitely needed a heavier moisturizer as with this product I would have dry patches on my cheeks. For me, this product was ok but I wouldn’t repurchase."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,,packaging 💔,"I bought this for my mom. Can't really comments personally but would prefer if it's a pump instead of a jar, to ensure all the ingredients remain fresh and no outside transfer from our hands. "
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,,smooth like heaven,"this cream is gel type and very easy to apply. the texture is very fine and skin feel so smooth after application. it hydrates my skin. but when  come to very dry and cold places,  it can not help much. recommend for summer hot time only."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,,Best Cream Ever,This is my second purchase.I love it so much because it makes my skin soft and no pimples since i used it.Highly recommended!I have used other moisturizer before but none good as this one.I use together with Origins toner.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,,I love it!,Everything from Origins smells AMAZING and this really works for my skin. A little goes a long way and it lasts me all day. Do try this product. I highly recommend it. 
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,,nice,"Leaves your skin super energized and bright, cuts off dryness and gives your skin a great moisture especially during bad breakout days Great packaging/ portable/ easy to handle/ thick consistency/ energizing scent/ easy applications/ lasts long"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,I'm hooked! Love how my skin feels!,"I absolutely love this treatment! My skin feels so silky and smooth, hard to accomplish in my dry Colorado climate! I'm hooked!"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,,fav,"one of my favorite moisturizer, smells good, very relaxing and soothing... so far this is my 3rd purchase already... kinda pricey.. the gel texture will not let you feel sticky or oily.. suitable for combination and oily skin."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,LOVE especially for oily/acne prone skin,"I have very oily skin and most moisturizers either clog my pores or don't hydrate my skin at all (leaving me more oily later). This treatment (used as a moisturizer daily/nightly) soaks into my skin nicely (and quickly) leaving it hydrated, but it is light enough that it doesn't clog my pores at all. I've been using this for a couple years and after I stopped for a month or so I noticed that my skin was greasier and just dehydrated overall (I was using pure Aloe Vera as a moisturizer at the time) so I immediately went back and my skin is better."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,,my favourite moisturiser!,I have combination oily skin and this moisturiser has been working great on me so far! Hydrating but doesn’t give my face an oily and sticky feel. On my second tube now and still loving it. Would definitely recommend!!!
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,,Light weight Moisturizer,"Nice light weight moisturizer with light citrius scent.  This is too hydrated for my combination skin.  Easily absorbs into skin and smooth texturing.  It leaves my face hydrated and i used it for night time.  Good for my daily routine skincare.
"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,,origin night cream,"First of all, really like the smell which is like lemony and very fresh. hydrating enough, without making the skin feel too oily. Just wish if the price can be more competitive. "
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,,ultra moisturising without being greasy,This is an oil free yet super hydrating moisturiser. It has a serum gel based texture (like the laneige water sleeping mask but not sticky) which is not greasy or sticky. Smells refreshing too. Part of my absolute necessary skin care routine. I have been using this for more than 5 years and I haven't come across anything better that can replace it.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Just ok...,This is incredibly moisturizing. However I didn't notice any impressive skin changes and it was a little too much for my sensitive skin.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,AMAZING.,Just everything I need it to be. Perfect.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,,Great Moisturiser,I have combination skin type and this moisturiser suits me so well that I seldom have breakouts nowadays. The texture is very light yet very moisturizing. I like the smell too! Will definitely repurchase it.  
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,WINTER IS COMING,This is my favorite winter time moisturizer. I started using this last year since I was having problems with combination skin during the winter. This moisturizes without leaving me greasy!! Go ahead and buy it!
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Love it!,"I've been using this moisturizer since I was in high school (im late 20's now) and it does absolute wonders for my skin. I have oily skin and I usually use it after masks or an intense cleaning at night. I have tried the moisturizer version of this product, and while it was good as well, I always will gravitate and choose this."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Origins Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,I love the Origins line of skin care. This moisturizer is fantastic. It has a cool gel feel that is great for morning and night.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Best Primer,"I have been savouring this cream. I have so many origins products, but this has got to be one of my favourites. It is a perfect texture for under makeup, and the only product I've found that doesn't pill under my face. I do not use it at night, or as a heavy moisturizer but I have combination skin with oily and dry patches and this stuff is legit."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,overall amazing!!!,"Firstly, the smell is so nice, very fruity!! I use this as a daily moisturizer even though it says it's a treatment and I find it perfect as just that. I have combination skin that is very sensitive and this hasn't irritated my skin at all. I highly recommend this product!"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,,It is so refreshing ,"I love to use origin products, never disappoint me. The scent may be quite a problem for some people but personally, I feel it is alright. I love the gel texture, always make me look forward to applying it every morning and evening. I am sure to repurchase it!"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Magic!,I love this product! My skin has never been happier! I was very reluctant to try this because everything makes me break out but I have not had one breakout since using this rejuvenating treatment and my skin is now so smooth. Love it!
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,,absolutely in love,"This is super nice.  I have combination skin, oily at T zone and dry at cheeks. This cream works very nice on my skin as it mosturizes my skin without feeling greasy. Very fast absorbing too. Origin has never disappoint  me."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,mmm watermelon!,This moisturizer was recommended to me by an employee when I went in searching fir a night cream. It wasn't until I read up more on it that I resounded it can also but used as a day moisturizer so I have  decided  to try it as a daily moisturizer once my current one is finished. Highly recommend!
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Great product,This was recommended by an employee and I love it! It smells fantastic and absorbs into the skin very well. It leaves me hydrated and super soft. A little goes a long way. The price point is worth it to me.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,My favourite,Definitely my favourite Origins moisturizer. I have a combo/oily/dehydrated skin and this works perfectly:)
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Works well,I have dry skin and it has changed my skins texture making it smoother I also have fewer breakouts ?...it provides lightweight moisture without making me oily . It absorbs quickly . I use it both day and night it's great especially in the Florida humidity.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Smells Clean and Fresh,Great for dry skin. Very thick and hydrating.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,absolutely love this product,"My skin is combination/very oily around my t-zone, meaning I am always breaking out. I wanted something that can keep my pro acne skin under control and not too heavy. This product has met all my expectations, I absolutely love it!"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,not bad,"I have combination/sensitive skin, prone to acne and eczema and this hasn't irritated my skin (I am about half way through the jar now). A little goes a long way with it, the smell is fresh but my only issue is that it isn't SUPER hydrating on my dry spots and it also has a slick feeling to it. I probably would try something new before purchasing this cream but I have been enjoying it so far."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,not what I had hoped for,"I bought this product on the basis of reviews stating that it was great for rosacea. I suffer from extremely sensitive skin and acne rosacea, so I was really hoping for the best. Unfortunately, as most things tend to do, this just broke me out. Can't figure out why though! I also wasn't a huge fan of the scent, though it did absorb quickly and feel lightweight on the skin. I'm glad Sephora has such an excellent return policy. In the meantime, the hunt continues for a moisturizer that controls redness but is actually hydrating and won't break me out..."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,light but still moisturizes,"Been using this for almost two years, tried to change but kept returning to it. It's light but still moisturizes and the smell isn't strong."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,a great moisturizer even in MN winters!,"I have never found an eye cream that I liked--until this one. I'm on jar 2 now. During our crazy cold MN winters, my face and eyes in particular became painfully very, very dry. I tried this on my eyes and it's been the only thing that magically works while I sleep to truly hydrate and de-crustify (EW I know!) my eye area. The only con is that it sometimes can be very irritating to my eyes when they're open so it's something I HAVE to put on before bed."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Origins Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,"this is pretty good, though it sometimes feels a little drying. it moisturizes without being too greasy, and it smells so good!"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,good for day,Using this under my makeup lately and feeling pretty and moisturizer. Foundation lays nicely over top.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Good for oily skin,"Soaks in really fast. I sometimes need two coats for super dry, winter skin. But my skin has been MUCH less oily since using - for about 2 weeks now. Definitely recommend."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Good for Oily Combination Skin,I have oily combination and acne prone skin. This does a really good job moisturizing without causing breakouts. Minus one star because it may not be hydrating enough during the winter. Other than that its great and I'm almost finished with my second jar. Will keep on repurchasing unless I find a better one :)
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Effective But Light Moisturizer,"It smells wonderful and absorbs quickly. I have oily, acne-prone skin and haven't had any problems from this treatment."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,really wanted to love this,"I was looking forward to this moisturizer considering the high reviews and really wanted to love it, but every time I use this it breaks me out!! I do like how it absorbs into my skin, but it's not worth the 5 or 6 pimples I get the next day from using this. I definitely suggest trying it first (my breakouts were immediate after using this product)"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Day or night cream,"Very hydrating, more of a gel base rather than a thick cream, good for any time of the day or night, smells nice!"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Great for Sensitive Skin,"Having really sensitive skin, it's difficult to find a moisturizer thats gentle and natural enough. Origins really created a wonderful product. A little goes a long way as well, so the jar will last you. I recommend this highly to anyone in the market for a better moisturizer, because this is it."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,"love , love , love",Okay so ladies I absolutely love this product. I have combination skin but tent to get really dry skin during winter so !!! This origins moisturizer helps me get rid of the dry patches so if you have that problem try this out !! My skin just soaks this up and I feel it work as soon as I put it on. This is money well spend and you need a tiny amount ladies so its worth it !!!
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,"Love it, will never be without it.","This is just a wonderful product. I can't say enough about it. I use it everyday, and at night it is gentle enough to put on my eyes as we'll. I have combo/oily skin and this has never given me an oil slick, and absorbs beautifully. The scent is light and fresh. Wears great under makeup."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,great!,"Great product! Especially for oily skin. It's more like a gel base not a greasy lotion base so if you have oily skin like me and don't want your makeup getting oily after a long day, buy this product! You won't regret it!"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,"Feels great, makes my skin look awesome",I put it on dabs of it all over my face and rub it on using my makeup brush. It feels wonderful and my skin is looking better after only a week and a half. Love this stuff!
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,love origins,"First... Origins clarisonic is a sure for flawless skin no matter ur skins issue.

I've had combo skin for life and always had the annoying bumps all over my forehead... Origins lady suggest was to moisturize. I use the make a difference and the make a difference toner.
In only a week my bumps are almost all gone(wow) and I'm not left with oily skin. I only have my occasional hormonal breakouts.
Please use if your combo skin needs some TLC"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,"Good, but not Great for Oily Skin","I received this as a gift and have been using it as a night cream. It's on the lighter side when I apply it after cleansing before bed, but I have combination-oily skin and when I wake up in the morning my skin tends to feel very greasy. I will probably finish the container, but not repurchasing."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Summer Skincare staple!,"I've just repurchased my third & I love this treatment. I use it mainly in the evenings after my serum and I find it soothes, moisturizes and just makes my skin feel good. Especially enjoy it in the hotter months as it feels so refreshing."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,The best non-greasy moisturizer EVER,I've been using this stuff for at least 10 years or more It's simply amazing. It is a multipurpose moisturizer - not just great for sun damage and lines but great for elbows and the chest/neck area. I used this stuff for 2-3 wks on my chest/neck after seeing a friend get amazing results and I couldn't believe the difference it makes. I'm almost 44 but my skin looks much younger than some 25-30 year olds. I know part of the reason why is because I've been using this so long. I put it all over my face (except t-zone) including under my eyes. It's just amazing. If Origins ever stops making it I will freak.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,O R I G I N S . . . All day every day!,"I started out with wanting a hydrating night cream and was recommended the Origins ""Night-a-mins"" cream. That product was amazing, but was not a daytime product so when my other less exciting daytime moisture product was done I decided to upgrade to this Origins product as my daytime regimen. Im so happy I did. This product is amazing. Light weight, good with sensitive skin like mine, moisturizing all day, great look under makeup, smells good, lasts forever, totally worth the money! I cannot say enough about it, even my boyfriend tries to steal it from me. If you are holding back because of price or size of product, really don't, skin care should be splurged on... You have to look at your skin for the rest of your life, you should do everything to make it beautiful."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Origins Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,"Bought this and having been using since the winter months, and it's nothing spectacular. It does absorb quickly and leave your skin soft and non-greasy, but was of no help to my areas of dry skin."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Not what I was expecting,"I have been looking for a good moisturizer for a long time, one that is thick, creamy and absorbs properly so that it looks good under my BB cream. I have used alot of different Origins products and am always left feeling ""meh"". That was the same with this product. The consistancy was too thin and it just felt like it sat on my skin and made it feel tight when it dried. It smells good and is calming so i'll probably keep if for after peels or masks. Really not hydrating (for me anyways)"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Great lotion,"I use this every morning. I love this. At first I thought the smell would be a deal breaker (it's kind of strong and not my favorite smell) but after putting it on it quickly goes away. Now, after using this for a few weeks, I don't even notice the smell anymore. It leaves my skin soft and moisturized but not greasy. I do use a primer over it."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,great stuff,"I love this stuff! However, it does not absorb as much as I'd like, as I'm left with a super-soft-feeling film on my face (like silicone)."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Origins Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,This product is the besttttt. I love the feeling it has transformed my skin to being silky soft.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Holy Grail of Moisturizers,"I have been using this moisturizer for years now, but I occasionally intersperse its use with other products just to see if there's anything better out there. There isn't. Seriously, this moisturizer is lightweight, yet provides intense hydration, all without making my skin oily.

I also love the scent and rich, smooth texture of this moisturizer. It's just one of those products that not only gets the job done, but feels nice to put on.

Bottom line: this product is amazing and worth the money"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,amazing,"i bought this after reading a beauty blog and wanted to try something different after my clinique and i love this! it smells amazing, and it is rich enough for winter and i can tell that this will be great in the summer. a little goes a long way, also."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Great moisturizer,"Love this product, especially in the winter time! I have combination (T-Zone) skin and even though this ""treatment"" is for oily skin, it does not become ""drying"" or feel ""gel-like"". It absorbs well and works in combination with other non-Origin products. I'm not married to any particular skin care brand, but will definitely try other Origin products after having used this one.
On a side note, the Sephora representative at the store was misinformed and did not know much about this product. She was convinced that there are only two versions out there."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,My favourite moisturizer,"I have been using this moisturizer for a few years now. I love how lightweight and quick-absorbing it is. I have combination-oily skin so this is perfect for me; I have to admit that I used to avoid moisturizers because of this.

I stopped using it briefly due to price, but ended up going back to it because everything else feels so heavy on my face. This is, for me, a quality product over the other moisturizers out there for oily skin."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,THE BEST MOISTURIZER EVER!,i have a combination skin and this stuff is the best! especially in the winter my skin get more dryer but this one works like magic!
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Just not for me,"There's nothing terrible about this lotion- it smells great, it tingles (in a nice way, not in a way that irritates my sensitive skin), and is very cooling. It's definitely not as moisturizing as I would have liked, but I was looking for a very specific, very rich, thick, cream for my dry, dehydrated face. I'm keeping this around just to use in case my skin is feeling irritated or possibly after a treatment or something, but it's just not what I was looking for. Smells nice, though."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Hydrating/calming,"At first, I was slightly put off by the intensely herbal smell of this treatment, but after using it for a few weeks now I have actually come to enjoy it.

This treatment really sinks in and hydrates the skin before facial oil and moisturizer. I like to spray my face first with a thermal water and/or rosewater and then apply this while my face is still damp to really maximize the hydrating benefits. My skin has been smoother, more even toned, and more plump/full. I have also noticed a reduction in redness/irritation.

I think this might serve as enough hydration to serve as a ""moisturizer"" for those with oily skin, but definitely not for someone with dehydrated/oily skin. The texture is a lovely creamy gel that absorbs beautifully.

Thank you to Kate from the gh0stparties blog for the recommendation!"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,LOVE THIS SO MUCH,"I got this to use as a lighter summer nighttime moisturizer. I know it says treatment, but I still only use this by itself; some people use it under another moisturizer. I find this to be moisturizing enough alone. But as the winter months are coming, I will probably layer on another moisturizer on top because it's really windy where I live and my face tends to get a little chapped.
An unexpected benefit from this product is that it has really helped with my acne. I tend to get cystic acne and clogged pores/blackheads that look like small raised bumps. I rarely ever get whiteheads. This product has definitely helped reduce the small clogged bumps on my skin."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Great for my Rosacea!!,"I got this as a sample, put it on in the morning, went out in the sun and worked in the garden for 4 hours. When I came in I glanced in the mirror while washing my hands and noticed that my face hardly had any redness! I couldn't believe it!!! I tried again the next day with the rest of the sample, just to make sure it wasn't a fluke thing. It wasn't, so I ordered some right away. Well, I ran out about 3 weeks ago and just figured I'd use up my mega mushroom cream. My skin is back to super red, with flaky little bumps again!!! Anyone with rosacea should give this a try. Nothing has ever taken away my redness and little bumps except for this make a difference plus rejuvenating treatment! I have tried everything under the sun for my rosacea and this is the only thing that actually helped. I will not run out of this again. It's worked amazingly well for me. Thank goodness my order will be here tomorrow."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Origins Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,I bought this for my husband. He is 28 and has combination skin. He says it's lightweight and absorbs quickly adding good moisture that stays for long enough time. Writing the review after I bought the 3rd one for him!
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Love it,"I really love this product! I usually have oily skin and it is great and light weight, i also use acne cream i use that makes certain parts of my face very dry and scaly and this product definitely helps the dry parts too! The only draw back is that it sometimes stings/burns my skin."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,"Light, absorbs well!","If you have combo/oily skin like I do you absolutely NEED a lighter, more absorbant moisturizer like this! Or even someone with dry or normal skin...this makes a great Summertime moisturizer. I feel it comfortably absobs within 2-3 minutes enough to continue with regular makeup routine."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Origins Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,"Absolutely love this product.

It may not be moisturising enough for dry/normal skins, but it's absolutely fine for my oily-ish skin on its own. Helps to hydrate but also reduce scarring and my blemishes/acne clears up a bit faster after using this."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Fast results!,"During a recent trip my skin started breaking out really bad and generally just be in a very bad condition. It was extremely dry and whenever I applied something to my skin (cleanser, moisturizer, make up) it stinged really bad. Also my blemishes didn't quite look like acne, they were slightly ""blister"" like.

Came across a review on this product and picked it up as soon as I got home. I applied it at night before bed and already the next day my skin was feeling SO MUCH BETTER! The blemished had gone down (still there, but a lot smaller) and my face didn't sting AT ALL when I did my morning routine. I'm really amazed by the results and went and purchased the moisturizer in the same line the day efter. Again, after only one night of applying it the dryness was greatly improved.

My skin was completely back to normal after 3 days."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,amazing,"I have combo skin with oily T zone and suffer from regular mild to moderate adult acne as well as large pores on my nose. When I went to the Origins counter, I opted for the gel-based treatment version of this product rather than the moisturizer version fearing the moisturizer would add further shine to my T zone. So far, this treatment has not disappointed. It hydrates my skin so well after just one application in the morning it has dramatically reduced my breakouts and improved the texture of my skin with a brighter complexion and less visible pores over the last 3 weeks. It is truly an amazing product. For those of you whose breakout stems from over drying your face with ace products leading to sebum over production and more acne formation, this may help stop that vicious cycle for you and lead your skin to a better place it ought to have been a long long time ago. Highly recommend!"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,"Hydrating, slightly greasy","Well, I had high hopes for the Origins Make a Difference Plus + cream. But ladies, be warned, there are 6, yes 6 different oils in this product!! Yikes! If your are looking for a lightweight day cream, this is not the product for you. If your skin, however, is as dry as the Sahara then you will love this. Just love it. This might work for me in the winter...definitely not in the summer. Love the packaging, nice fresh smell, love the natural element. I just didn't research well enough, it is for DRY dehydrated skin...not combination oily. I am transitioning this to an intensive moisturizer to the back of my hands before the bed!"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Origins Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,I had read great reviews on sephora and from beauty blogs but this broke me out.. I seem to have issues with Origin products always breaking out.. I don't know what it is but nothing seems to work for me from their line.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Not suitable for oily skin,Much too rich for my oily skin (even for a nighttime moisturizer). Didn't cause me to breakout though.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Origins Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,The product is a great moisturizer. It does not leave my face feeling greasy. I have very sensitive and dry skin and this product has not caused any further breakouts and it keeps my face hydrated all day. I would definitely recommend this product!
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,excellent value,"loved the moistutre-even though I'm oily-made my face feel ""fresh""!"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,"Great product, bad smell",I love this product: it has the perfect texture of really moisturizing my skin without being super greasy. I use a straight up sunscreen in the morning and love this for the nighttime. The only con I can think of is I am not very fond of the scent. I suppose that is the cost of using a natural product.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Origins Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,Purchased after having bought and loved the origins night a mins cream. This has a light and refreshing scent and dries quickly. Having moved from a humid to dry climate my skin really needed an extra moisture boost and this has really helped keep my skin hydrated without causing breakouts or a greasy feeling. I apply this under my hydrating makeup primer and it feels hydrated all day.
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,"Good, but use sparingly for oily skin","I really enjoy the texture and fragrance of this product. It is very hydrating and leaves the skin feeling incredibly smooth. I have oily skin, but wanted a hydrating treatment to help with speed up the process of fading some of my acne scars. I've found that I only need to use a little bit of this; if I use a lot, it just exacerbates my oiliness. I've only been using it for about three weeks and my skin feels very hydrated. Gals and guys with oily skin, get this if your skin is dehydrated but use sparingly!"
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Origins Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,"Nice product, but rubs off (balls up) when putting on foundation. Maybe it's just not absorbing well enough. . ."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Pretty good but not a HG.,"I went into Origins to actually get the Mega Mushroom cleanser and instead got trapped by one of the very anxious-to-be-helpful, clingy salespeople and talked into trying the line that this belongs to. It does smell really, really good - one of the reasons I got talked into buying it - and after it absorbs it does make my skin feel really soft and supple. I almost can't help but touch my face kind of soft. It is lightweight and doesn't feel heavy. And it smells really good.
The cons: it takes a couple of minutes to absorb into MY skin (which I guess is different than others here) and it doesn't quite moisturise my cheeks enough, as I'm often left with flaky patches. Another fingerful of the gel-creme will make them go away, but this stuff is pretty pricey, and I don't like having to make another pass to do what it should do in one. Also, I'd really prefer a pump as the jar packaging isn't very hygienic. Still, you can see how much you have left.
But it smells really good and it does work pretty well on most parts of my face. My forehead (with fringe) is the only part that usually gets greasy during the day.
Did I mention it smells good? Mmm."
ORIGINS-Make A Difference™ Plus+ Rejuvenating Treatment,USA,Hydrating really well,"This is my first time trying a moisturizer from Origins, and I'm happy with my purchase. I love how it hydrates my skin right away, with a nice scent. I'd recommend this to anyone. :)"
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,tatcha water cream,"It feels cold when u apply it, feels like it takes so long to dry than my other moisturizer. would use this better for night time moisturizer would not suggest in the morning use as it takes long to absorb and no time to wait for it to dry"
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,very hydrating,I really like the water cream because it is really hydrating and light weight… there is some smell to the cream but really dont bother me because the hydration that it give
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,love it,It’s an expensive cream but I will say it’s all worth it.It lasted me around 2 months as a very small amount is needed to moisturize.This does not clog pores.
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,super in love,"superrrr in loveeeeee with this one. have repurchased more than 3 times. bought the small one for travel. n finally bought the fullsize big one. it has a nice gold spatula to scoop for big full size one. love it so much
"
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Best moisturizer!,"Absolutely moisturizing, feels so fresh after applying and this is perfect for oily skin so it’s not greasy at all! The product itself is so smooth when applied on the skin & practically glides through the skin. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,so far ok but not worth the price ,"It’s light, watery, and has a nice scent. However, apart from the pretty packaging and the golden spoon to scoop the lotion, I’m not sure that it’s worth it. There are a lot of other lotions that are of similar texture and functionality and yet is cheaper. I don’t think I’ll buy this again "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,the best so far,"Scooped a small amount, applied onto my face and instantly absorbed into my skin. don't know what to say. my mouth and eyes were just wide open for good few seconds!"
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,Ms,"I know the price point is really high but it lasts forever. I used one bottle for over six months. It has a lovely refreshing smell, it helps oily skin look hydrated, and if you have acne or texture like me, it tends to plump and hydrate the dry skin patches that develop from acne treatment like retinoids or benzoyl peroxide. I love the texture of this cream and I will continue to purchase this ! "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,tatcha the water cream,"My absolute favourite moisturiser, suitable for my oily/dry combo skin… easily absorbed, never greasy, always nourishing and it just feels so good to layer this on after washing my face, or scrubs/exfoliating… I always buy a bottle as spare in case this runs out… "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,great product,I absolutely love this product. My face is super soft throughout the day and feels very moisturized throughout the day. Love how it makes my skin feel! The best!
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,amazing and worth it ,"This is one of the few products that I actually actively used till it is finished. Light and not sticky, very gentle on the skin. Great for wearing in the day. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Good for oily skin,"This is one of my favourite moisturisers to use. With one major caveat - the packaging. I hate that this is in a jar because it’s unhygienic and I always feel like your skin can never be 100% sterile (even after washing your hands). Ultimately you’re adding bacteria and germs into the jar every time you use it. HOWEVER, the product itself is amazing for my oily combination skin. This really glides and keeps my skin hydrated.

The price is indeed justified for the quality of product you’re getting. Although I really wished they offered the exact same formula in a tube form or pump form. Also one of the must-buys during sales (25% ones)."
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,best eva,the thing goes on to feel q creamy like other moisturizer before suddenly melting into a lightweight “watercream” that feels very light on your skin and very moisturizing 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,too rich for me,Love the packaging and the smell. Too bad I don’t think this is for me..fast absorption but I have break out after using this. Gave it to my mum and she loves it.
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Philippines,Effective,"Fantastic, light weight cream. I love how it feels on the skin and love more how great my skin looks and feels in the morning. Good fit for my oily/combination skin. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,Tatcha Water Cream,"Tatcha Water Cream is a god-send in hot and humid Asian weather. It somehow manages to moisturize my skin without any tacky or greasy feeling. After application, I can barely feel the moisturizer and my skin feels more plump after a few months"
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Smooth ,I like it’s texture and smell. The cream is smooth and not thick. It’s watery and easily absorbed to skin. The design of the bottle is cute and pretty.
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,repurchased multiple times!,"It’s expensive yes, but this cream is truly one of a kind. Probably not enough if you have super dry skin but anything from combi to oily skin it works beautifully. Water cream really is a flood of moisture to the skin and has its own unique texture. It’s simple but effective and really good even for sensitive/eczema prone skin! "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,true classic favourite ,"I tried the mini size and immediately purchases the full size during the promos. This moisturiser is lightweight, it absorbs into the skin very fast and have a natural finish to it. Its not sticky or tacky. A little goes a long way."
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,Just a basic cream,"the texture is indeed watery but too lightweight for moisturizer, after consecutive days of applied had not seen any impact on the skin, no break out tho, wear it together with the free minis essence + dewy serum that supposed to be a booster but nothing really. tatcha is just another overhype product tbh and there is something unsettling about the smell that could not stand it. with that price you can get versatile moisturizer that really can work as day and night use."
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,the best,"The best moisturizer for my combination acne prone skin! Just LOVE it!! Even the acne scars from before are healing so quickly, it has a super repairing power!! "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,smooths wrinkles,its good but it makes me skin more oily. i have oily skin already so it doesnt feel that great. i found it works really good on undereyes and the general eye area though! 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,The perfect cream ,"The water cream gives the smooth feeling without feeling sticky. I love the texture of the cream when applied to my skin. Highly recommended.

My first time using this product and I simply like the texture. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Ms,A light gel like cream that quickly gets absorbed by the skin. Refreshing to use and it smells great too. My 2nd purchase; will continue to use. Cons: a little pricey. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Perfect amount of moisture,"Amazing gel moisturizer, does not leave my skin feeling oily! Very cute packaging as well. The biggest drawback is the price - I think that Origin's Ginzing is of similar consistency and half the price. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,tatcha water cream,Highly recommend for those who doesn't like heavy moisturiser cream. It's more like gel type and light weight. Fast absorption on the skin and the skin feels so soft after applying. Love it.  
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,the bestest ,I have very oily skin acne prone skin but also sometimes looks dehydrated and this has transformed my skin like no other. If you're looking for I moisturizer that changes how your skin feels and looks than this is it. I am seriously never buying any other moisturizer. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,Nice,"Nothing felt uncomfortable for my sensitive skin. After the product was absorbed, my face felt fully hydrated, yet it was almost as if I hadn’t used anything at all."
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,not bad,"it is moisturizing and definitely brightened my complexion but it unfortunately feels abit too heavy for daytime use, and the price point is intimidating"
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,Luxe,"Luxury in a jar, this cream literally melts into the skin. Love it"
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Ms,Literally WATER cream! So in love during my first try. This is the best moisturiser that I have ever used so far and I will definitely purchase it again. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Australia,best cream for my sensitive and combination skin,"I've been using this cream for 3 years and nothing beats it. i would like it to have more anti aging properties tho or stronger ingredients a part of green tea; however I'm very happy with the light texture and it keeps my skin hydrated without creating clogged pores etc. my skin is smooth, even and feels good."
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,love love love,"This stuff is amazing. Im at my third jar and finishing fast. The price is eekkk but it works wonders on my very dry skin. If anyone asks me what to gift me, it would defo be this. Loveeee"
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Luxurious moisturiser ,I use this moisturiser twice a day and I am very happy every time I use it. It works perfectly for my combination skin. It keeps my face well moisturised and does not cause any breakouts or stinging. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,amazing,"Despite being a moisturiser, it really does live up to its name of being a water cream. It goes on like a cream but as you rub it in, it bursts into a watery texture which makes the cream feel so lightweight and breathable on the skin. However, I do realise that as time passes, the cream loses its watery texture and becomes slightly more oily (more like the conventional oily moisturiser texture)."
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,good but way overpriced  ,Love the texture and packaging. Love the spatula provided because I really don’t like putting my finger in product stored on jar. It does its job well but the price paid is not worth it. Might repurchase if there’s discount. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Gentle and easily absorb,My second time repurchasing this item. It is gentle on the skin and easily absorb for oily/ combo skin. I prefer this than the purple one given the weather in sg. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,The best moisturizer,"Repeating buyer, High price but very good texture, light and easy to absorb by the skin. Feel moisture enough even it is light type cream. My daily face cream!"
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,love love ,I have combination skin and my skin loves it. Great for day wear and it moisturisers without feeling oily. Very light yet I don’t breakout when I use this cream. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Ms ,Easily absorbed into the skin. I use this in my morning skincare routine as it is light but moisturises my skin really well. A little goes a long way. Highly recommended!
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Light Cream ,This is by far the lightest cream I tried. It absorbs so well into the skin and prep the face for make up! High recommended if you have sensitive skin and oily skin! 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,its so lovely on the skin,For reference I have oily skin.This moisturiser disappears beautifuly on my skin.Its not heavy at all! To be fair I do not use much fragranced skincare but I have badly wanted to try the water cream.The scent is a little over powering and staying on for a couple minutes.Other than that I love the water cream and the tiny gold spatula that comes with it.
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Ms,Love this item so much. Bought for my friend and she loves it too. Thanks 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,The water cream,while some may not like it but it's one of the best cream I've used so far. I'm a combi skin and tends to have dry patches on my cheeks n chin in the middle of the day but my skin improved greatly after using water cream. the bad part is that it's quite expensive so recommend to get the travel set to try before committing. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,day time moisturiser,"It seems to moisturise my skin, I can’t quite make up the feel on my skin. It feels like water with silicone? Not sure whether I like it though, still trying to I guess "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Pretty packaging & with amazing results! ,"Earlier this year, I experienced some severe clogging in my pores. I wasn't exactly sure why. Then I started forcing myself to drink tons of water, and staying away from sweets. The only change to my skincare regimen was the replacement of my moisturizer. It is lightweight with a gel-like consistency that absorbs almost instantly. I use it once a day after my regular cleanser and toner routine. It doesn't clog my pores, and it leaves my face with a clean but hydrated, with a glow finish. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,this is good stuff!,I have used skii and some other X brands but this tops the list. The other moisturisers can leave my skin feeling oily/or sit too heavy and make me sweat after but not this one. Lightweight and i highly recommend this to those looking for the light moisturiser. Maybe for some looking for deeper moisturiser might need to reapply more frequently. But I’m happy with this product regardless 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,worth to buy during sale period,"I accidentally dropped the spoon into my toilet drainage - silly me! So I could not estimate the amount of cream required for each usage. I tend to over-moisturize and by mid day my skin is getting oilier than usual. The key is to scoop a tiny bit of the cream and spread across your face and neck. Little does goes a long way. So far doing okay with the product, will I re-purchase? Probably during sale period as I could not justify buying this on normal price (too expensive)"
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,love the lightweight texture ,"Tatcha products are all about the sensorial experience while using the product. And of course the packaging looks nice on the vanity table. The texture is lightweight and absorbs easily, good for combination oily skin and for this humid weather. Minus one star because of the high price. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,Tatcha Water Cream,"Not the best moisturizer, lightweight, no sticky residue."
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,moisturized!,Love this moisturizer! Very light and still can make your face feel so hydrated and moisturized. Also will make your face dewy looking. I never even had the urge to use facial mist because my face already feel hydrated ! I am so inlove with tatcha products! Can’t wait to try them all!
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,this is really good!,"Though lightweight, it is really moisturising! I can see and feel a visible difference in my skin just after a few applications. Skin is softer and brighter. My skin is also less oily in the morning after I wake up. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Overrated,"Feels oily and the product kind of sits on my face without being absorbed. Skin is oily in the morning. For the price, I don’t think it is really worth it. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Must have!,"Really love this product, just what my oily-combination skin needs. Absorbs quickly and provides a good base for makeup to glide on! Have heard reviews about a similar dupe but I must say it doesn’t come close to this. Ran out and repurchased again "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,No effect,"Very pretty container, makes me happy looking at my dressing table. But no effect on my dry skin :( It is a very thin gel, dries fast. Probably for extremely oily skin. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Wow Wow Wow,price seems quite hefty and i initially did not want to buy for the aesthetic but i haven't come across a product from tatcha that i regret buying!!! and that says a lot because i've tried several skincare/makeup from a range of brands; both high& low end. this doesn't help with brightening but it sure does keep my face smooth& moisturised without being too sticky. great for anyone living in a tropical climate& beautiful under makeup. will repurchase.
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,light and easy to use.,First time trying out this product. just 1.5 scoop can cover the whole face and neck. Gel cream like becomes water after spreading it onto the skin.  Very moisturising. But after awhile my face becomes oily. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Miss ,It’s easy & replenishes you at night when you sleep. I love the gel-like formula. It’s like nothing on your skin. It gives you a new layer of skin in the morning. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Loving it!,I love it! I tried the travellers size a few weeks ago before investing in the 50ml. I am very happy with it. It oil controls and hydrates my oily combi and sensitive skin. I find my skin a lot more healthier and my pores are somehow less visible especial around the nose area. My skin appears equally fresh and matt after long hours of heat trapping behind the mask wearing. My skin is very ‘picky’ with products and this is by far one of my skin care that doesn’t disappoint. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,I am in love,The first tatcha product i tried and i am in love. The texture is so special easily absorb into the skin. One of the best skincare I’ve used-trust me I tried loads of them. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,my holy grail,Lightweight and gentle. I have combi skin and this does not cause my face to get oily unlike other moisturizers. This is probably my 8th or 9th bottle already. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,my faverote moisturiser from tachta.,this kind of mosturizer i will never leave. suitable for my skin type which is oily combination and open pores. cooling sensation and never sticky. recomended for those who have same problem like me . smell good and relax. easy to absorb. just little can use all over your face. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,wallet hurts but its soo good,"i love this to bits.. tatcha remains one of my favourite brands because it works.. i hv oily combi skin that is also sensitive, this works beautifully on me! light but keeps me moist without turning me into an oil field.. i have to have it with me whenever i travel in case the skin decides to go on strike"
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,Ms. ,"I really wanted to love this since I've used a tester before in the past but for some reason, this made me breakout into uncontrollable acne and I am still suffering from it after 3 months. 

Beautiful packaging though. Perhaps do a spot test before lathering this all over your face like I did. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,I'm in love,"The best moisturizer i had ever try. It feels so nice on the skin, like a burst of water. Its something i never experience before. I was scared that i broke out from it just like the other reviewers. Thank God it didn't. It's not oily at all. Eventhough its a light moisturizer, it keeps my face moisturised for a long time. I don't regret spending my money on it and will be repurchasing. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Very moisturizing,Keep skin refreshing and moisturising. It won't stick. Very convincing posts are also quickly absorbed. Best recommended to oily skins. Especially dry skin that is peeled is very effective. It's not that dry the next day. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,Miss,"This moisturiser is the bomb! It’s such a hassle having to try and error what’s the right moisturiser for my face, tried Drunk Elephant protini before this, and I find it rather rich for my skin. This one on the other hand is just perfect for my sensitive skin, it gives me a glow finishing, as well as leaving my face feeling fresh for the whole day. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,great product,"This cream feels light when applied, absorbs well and doesn’t leave a terrible sticky residue. My face still feels soft, plump and nicely moisturized the nice day. I have oily- combination skin and a lot of other creams in the market makes me feel that I have a thick layer of oil on my face which doesn’t absorb well. This works for me! Would be getting more. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Disappointment ,"Decided to try this product out as there was a lot of good reviews online however ended up disappointed as the tub was not fully filled, there was a large spot that was empty at the bottom of the tub. For the price I paid, definitely not worth the purchase."
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Film sits on face,"Bought it for my mom who has oily skin in her 60s. She feedback that the product sits on her face without absorption, and it’s like an additional film. No additional effects like brightening or additional moisturising, just perform its basic job. Finished using the product for the sake of it, but has since moved on to other products."
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,tatcha,This is more for oily to normal skin type. It has a decent smell and the cream is fine too. Very moisturizing. But the price is  a bit on the expensive side. Will only repurchase when there is sales
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,lightweight!,Lightweight! Good for combi or oily skin types! Product included a spatula for ease of use. And a spot on top of the lid for that. Nifty! Don’t have to find a different place to store the spatula. Pretty packaging too! 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Seems alright ,"Packaging wise, I guess it fits the value of it. But I’m not so sure if there were any major differences in my skin when using it. More so, it’s best to use within 6 months after opening as compared to other creams considering if it’s worth the price. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,the water cream,"I have really oily skin. And sometimes weirdly, combination skin. The water cream suits humid weather and oily or combination skin best as it’s water based. It’s not oily or greasy at all. I haven’t used it as much yet, but a couple times and so far so good. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,slighly oily,"I have a combi skin, and this product is too oily and heavy for my skin. Personally i dont feel that it is very hydrating or whatsoever. This product is very overhyped."
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Lightweight Gel Cream,"Lightweight moisturiser suitable for oily & sensitive skin, it has a smooth velvety texuture. You will only need a little scoop for your entire face. For dry skin type, i would recommend buying their dewy skin cream instead."
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,"Good product, but..","This is a very good day cream, the texture is very watery and not oily at all. I thought it would work great in a hot and humid country like Singapore. Unfortunately it is too light, and not moisturizing enough for me even if I only apply it during the day. I guess it's more suitable for younger skin and especially combination and oily skin. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,3 out of 5,In term of packaging it does look beautiful and exclusive. But it does not give me the enough hydration. Upon application is slides. Feels like silicone. But doesn’t make me breakout. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,love the packaging and texture of the cream,the whole product looks so pretty on the outside. love that the spatula can be placed on top of the cover as part of the design. gel cream with a watery burst. good product for oily skin. however it does take awhile for the product to get absorbed well into my skin 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Tatcha,"I love this product! Definitely recommend it. However, it’s a little pricey but definitely worth it. If you are someone who loves soft primers, THIS IS IT!!
So soft on your skin and smells amazing. 10/10!! Truly amazing.  I recommended this product to my friends and family and they loved it! "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,amazing!,"this is the best hydrating moisturiser i've ever tried. and it lasts probably for 2-3 months, not too long, i think? it leaves your skin feel moist and glowy. cut off half star as i feel its a little pricey? after i finished a jar of this, i opt for some other brands to give them a try, for me to compare and decide if Tatcha is the right one.
turns out, yes, Tatcha is the right one and now i'm having 3 different tubs of other moisturiser for me to finish before going back to this sigh"
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Less hydrating than I remember,"I first tried this as a sample on my oily skin and it worked wonders for my skin back then. However now I seem to have drier to combi skin. While this moisturiser does the job and makes my skin feel quite smooth, I feel like it’s not moisturising enough anymore for drier skin types."
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,THE GLOWING EFFECT,"I feel so stunning & glowing after apply this. Definitely will repurchase regardless the price. Seriously, just try this & you will feel the same as what I feel everyday."
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,love the box and its so refreshing ,"i really love the box, its so luxury and smells good and easily absorb by the skin and its so refreshing . gonna try and might repurchase again. hope for the best"
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,love it!!!,super good! this is a must buy but is a the pricey side. very nice smell and smooth gel like texture. is more worth it with the limited edition season gift set.  me and my mum loves it very much! very good! love it!
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,good for day use ,"I love the smell of this product, it spreads easily on the skin. Initially this takes on a medium weight cream consistency, however after applying into the skin, it’s turns really lightweight and moisturizing. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,Tatcha The Water Cream,Tatcha The Water Cream. Highly recommend on this product to everyone especially for oily skin type. Once you applied to the skin you will immediately feel watery texture on your skin. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,Lightweight & reduce appearance of pores,"Love this product! Overall, I’ll buy it again.

Pros:

1) Lightweight texture not sticky and quickly absorbed into skin 
2) Reduces pores appearance
3) Brightens skin

Cons:

1) Watery texture makes you feel like you are not applying enough 
2) Expensive"
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Ms,Like how light and non-sticky the moisturiser feels on my face. Doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. My face no longer looks oily throughout the day. Packaging is pretty too. The smell is slightly strange though and the texture is so lightweight that i wonder if it really helps with anti-aging. We’ll see! 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,Love it!,"This feels incredibly luxurious, everything from the packaging to the scent and feel of the cream on my skin. It’s a pretty light watery consistency and when I use it with the liquid silk canvas under makeup it really makes my skin glow."
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,LOVE,"
I have normal to dry skin which is very sensitive. I really like this product. It's not sticky, provides enough moisturizing for me and is light feeling, not heavy like some moisturizers. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,I don't understand the hype,"Perhaps this is great for people with oily skin, cos it's oil free. But it felt sooo dry on my combination skin, its like I had no moisturiser on at all. And it's so expensive for such an ineffective moisturiser. I'll be sticking to Dr. Dennis Gross, Sunday Riley or Kate Somerville for great oil-free moisturisers, thanks. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,A good splurge,"Beautiful packaging and bottle design. The gold spatula is a nice touch and I love how it fits nicely into the cover and forms part of the design. The moisturizer is lightweight and it doesn't leave behind a greasy residue or cause breakouts. It feels luxurious, just like the price tag. I'm giving it only 4 cuz of the high price point. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Forever Repurchase ,The texture of this cream absorbs rather quickly after being applied. Doesn’t feel heavy or uncomfortable even though I have oily skin.                                  
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,the best,The best as i can see improvement on my skin. Look brighter and give me satisfaction as i need. I will abs repurchase this item but need to wait for a discounted price because it is so expensive
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,irreplaceable ,"On my fourth tub now. Can’t find anything to replace it (as this is pretty costly) even though everyone says there are cheaper Korean brand alternatives. I tried the aqua bomb from belief and even though it is about 80% similar, it doesn’t have the same kick. I guess if you can afford it (1 tub every 6 weeks) it’s a great moisturizer to stick to. Feels great, doesn’t cause breakouts, gives you a slight shine but it doesn’t bother me. Mixes well with my other products like sunday Riley/the ordinary/DE. For reference, I’ve got combination skin. "
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Good buy ,I have oily skin and I love this water cream! I've used 4 jars. The texture is light but still sufficiently moisturizing. I use it before applying makeup primer in the morning. Will repurchase again.
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,a gentle cream,"If you want something mild and does the work of a moisturizer, this is it. It’s so gentle on the skin that it envelops it like a glove. It’s suitable for young skins or the sensitive ones. Great for day use!"
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Malaysia,Wish it would remain non oily for longer,The cream turns into watery consistency the moment it touches my skin and absorbs really well. However after a few hours there would be noticeable shine and oily skin. The slight scent is bearable but not my favourite. 
TATCHA-The Water Cream,Singapore,Awesome ,"The texture of the cream is so fluffy and light and its so easy to absorb as well. Highly recommend it...........           


                                       "
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,omega water cream ,"will not repurchase. made my skin very oily and greasy looking, didn’t absorb at all and i hated the texture of it. there are definitely better alternatives. i have combo skin  "
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Malaysia,kinda good,Fully absorbed and the makeup looks great. Can feel the skin plumpy after using it. Recommended by Sephora staff according to my acne scene. Will purchase again 
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,good ,"Price point is great. Packaging is fine. Very nice lightweight water cream. When I first started using it I thought it had a slightly funny smell but I’m used to it now. Good product for its price. Would use this over FAB Water cream now.
"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,Super oily,"I have pretty oily & acne prone skin and had heard this was great for my skin type. Unfortunately this moisturiser made my skin so extremely oily after about 8 hours, like nothing I’ve experienced before. It wasn’t a bad moisturiser in those first few hours, it was extremely lightweight though."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,Meh,"very lightweight moisturiser that barely provides any hydration, i guess if you have extremely oily skin you might like this but for me this is a no it also smells kinda bad, "
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,New Zealand,so nice,"this is great for all the oily skin people out there that want a light weight moisturiser that is still hydrating, it feels cooling on the skin and a little goes a long way. it’s so adorable and great value for money"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,omega water cream ,"I found this product to be really hydrating and light weight on the skin, it did have a greasier feel after applied so only a small amount is recommended. My skin felt lovely and smooth after the cream has sunken in. Great for an everyday moisturiser!"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Malaysia,i’m scared of trying something new,"this is probably my second or third tube. so i must like it. it’s not thick, it doesn’t break me out. im gonna repurchase. im kinda scared of trying something new cause most moisturizers breaks me out. so take that however you want to i guess "
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,Lightweight moisturizer,"I actually like this moisturizer, was pleasantly surprised. I always wake up with glowy skin. The moisturizer itself is lightweight"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,Meh,Nothing special. Feels like you're putting water on your skin. Very light moisturizer
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,Obsessed but their is one major downfall,Literally LOVE the way this make my skin feel. It’s light enough for the daytime though not enough for night. The one problem I have with this product is that the bottle is so small so you don’t get a lot. Mines only lasted a little over a month. But I will keep buying over and over it’s THAT good
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,Light moisturizer,It works for me! Contains fatty acids which help with hyperpigmentation and bumps :)
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Malaysia,Miss,Was surprised at how lightweight this moisturiser is BUT dont be fooled by this. It did its job well in moisturising my face. LOVE.
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Singapore,nice product,"on application it feels super lightweight and very hydrating. feels like rubbing water into the skin but later feels slightly oily, not in a bad way. i use this at night bcos i have oily skin. "
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,pretty good,This product is a really good moisturiser and very lightweight. It helped hydrate my dry skin and is super nice under makeup. Makes it look so smooth and dewy
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,Great water-based cream serum!,"This product is more of a cream serum than a moisturiser. I love it! It is incredibly hydrating and great at rebuilding a dehydrating lipid barrier. The first-most ingredients are water, glycerin (humectant), and niacinamide. Betaine and propanediol are both humectants, too. I layer this product after cleansing and toning, before oils and moisturisers. It is also an excellent product to use under makeup as it is oil-free!

10/10 recommend this product for everyone!"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,Eh,"I like the light consistency when I put it on. However, I feel super oily after a few hours. I have oily-combination skin, so my face is bound to get oily, but this make me even oilier. It feels like my pores are all clogged and my blackheads are just so much more visible."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,Miss,I love this moisturiser! It feels very watery going on so I wasn't sure if it was going to be hydrating enough for my combination skin. However once it sinks in it leaves the skin feeling hydrated all day. Has the added benefit that it doesn't make my acne flare up.
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,Lightweight and great for sensitive skin,"I love this. New go-to moisturizer. Very lightweight, I have super sensitive allergy and acne prone skin, and I have had zero issues with this moisturizer."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Malaysia,Lightweight Moisture,"A very interesting moisturiser. Starts off with a thick consistency but as you rub it into the skin, it will turn into a watery consistency. Feels lightweight on the skin. Not much smell from the product. "
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,"Good for Summer skin, not Canadian winters","I bought this moisturizer in August, right before the temperature dropped and the air became dry. Between my period (my skin get's very dry on my period) and the winter, this moisturizer had a really hard time keeping up. After using it, patches of my skin we're still tight and even burned as a result of how dry my skin is. 
During the summer, I think this would be a good light cream. During the winter, it couldn't keep up for me."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,Love it so much!,My go-to moisturizer! it’s like your skin is drinking water. so worth it as it leaves a glowing finish and non-sticky on my skin. plus its pretty cheap so why not!
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Malaysia,really good facecream,"super happy with this facecteam. it's ideal for sensitive skin, no harmful ingredients and super smooth, watery texture cream. I really recommend it love it."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,Light watery texture ,For warmer weather this will be perfect! Light gel texture leaving your skin feeling hydrating but not greasy. It does leave a natural sheen on the skin (not the oily kind). 
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,Worst moisturizer I’ve ever used,The consistency is weird and greasy it felt oily and like it just clogged my pores. I started breaking out and the texture of my skin completely changed after using this for about a week. Definitely do not recommend.
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Malaysia,Good but not sure if will repurchase ,Works well but I think there are other cheaper options that works the same or even better. But worth to try! Not sure if I will repurchase. It has a funny smell though. Loving the minimal ingredients.
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,Pretty good,"I liked it, but as a day lotion. Wasn’t enough for night time. Great for the price"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,A fair moisturizer for price point,"I used the whole bottle and for the most part it was great as long as I did my entire skincare routine before it. I found on nights where I didn’t and just did the bare minimum, this moisturizer gave the same effort."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,"I wanted to love it because it goes in so light and gives me that glowy dewy look. But after 20-30 mins, my face just feels super greasy 😔"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Malaysia,still new,"im still new to this product, so far it done well on my face, i kinda have small pimples on my face, but after using this product i noticed my face getting better "
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,"I used this for two weeks consistently and it broke me out SO badly, I really wanted to love it as the Inkey List is super affordable and I've tried other stuff from them thats worked for me."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,ok,it was a pretty good mosuturizer just expected it to be bigger like all of my othe4 products from the inkey list but just a pretty basic overall mois5u4izer nothing special
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,definitely will use again,I have dry skin and this product has help hydrate it and I am not a fan of heavy products and moisturisers and this one is light however still feels like you are putting stuff onto your skin. I use this everyday and it has benefited my skin from being dry to normal now.!!
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,Amazing for oily but dehydrated skin!!,"LOVE this moisturizer. It deserves higher praise. Goes on feeling thicker but as you massage it in, it becomes a beautiful watery gel like a splash of water to the face. Perfect for oily but dehydrated skin. Gives you a healthy, glass skin glow! Can’t say enough good things. For the price you have to give it a try!!"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,"Got this especially for my t-zone because it’s oily and lightweight products work but I’ve been using it for a week and it doesn’t moisturize my skin, it makes my skin oilier and blackheads appear more. 
I do not recommend this to people who are looking for a lightweight moisturizer for the t-zone"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,Love it,"this moisturizer is amazing daytime. it feels like literal water on my face, so it super lightweight while still moisturizing ur face. 100% recommend!"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,Really love it. It is very lightweight though so I do find myself applying a few times a day. not necessarily a negative but if you’re looking for something to really hydrate you not sure it’s the best option.
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,"Not as moisturizing as I would have expected, especially as a water cream.  It's light though."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,Keeps my skin hydrated even with eczema! Isn’t harsh on the skin and doesn’t burn.
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,Affordable Summer Moisturizer Fav,Great cheap moisturizer!I love this moisturizer i use it under makeup and every time i need a little bit more hydration. I definitely would not recommend this for dry skin as i do not find it hydrating enough in the wintertime. however this is my go to summer moisturizer.hydrenoug
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,"it was okay, nothing special. It was light, but I expected it to be even lighter because of the name ""water cream"". still not bad."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,best moisturizer for makeup!!,this moisturizer made my base make up look so good!! I usually use a primer before any use of concealer and such but nowadays i only use this moisturizer for prepping. get this if you have oily skin ! :D
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,You Need To Buy If You Are Oily!,I decided to buy this product as my old moisturizer was just NOT hitting anymore but omg guys I’m never going to buy any other moisturizer. This moisturizer stopped me from being super duper oily and locked in moisturizer to my kin. Legit I had so much redness too and the redness significantly decreased.
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,Nothing special,"Ehhh nothing special, this did make me have little break outs throughout my face. Felt nice but didn’t feel moisturizing."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,nice light moisturiser ,Is a good moisturiser for oilier skin as it is quite light. Absorbs quickly and feels nice on the skin! A worthwhile purchase for a summer moisturiser or for more oily skin in the winter.
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,New Zealand,it's okay,"Not bad but if you've got dry skin I would recommend something else as it just wasn't hydrating enough for me. not a bad moisturizer though,.........."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,excellent,"I'm on my third bottle. very lightweight, not greasy, doesn't cause breakouts. perfectly happy with this purchase!"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,"Left an oily film, super disappointing.","I was SO excited to try this moisturizer but I was super disappointed. The formula is a gel but when it dries it still feels like an oily film on my face and it’s irritating. No matter how I apply it, I can’t seem to get rid of this oily feeling on my face. I definitely wouldn’t recommend this to any skin type because it just feels bad."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,New Zealand,Holy grail ,"Holy grail moisturiser, have repurchased multiple times and have got my friends on to this. Give such a a nice hydrated look with feeling oily!"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,Great for lightweight moisture,"This moisturizer is wonderful if you’re looking for  lightweight moisture and no oil. However I found it to be too light, and had to reapply several times throughout the day, as it left my skin feeling dry (and I have oily skin)"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,love! ,Love this moisturiser so much! It’s great! I’m onto my second bottle. Great for my sensitive combo skin. Lightweight and never feels greasy. I pair it with TIL hyaluronic acid serum.  Love that it has no offensive smell. 
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,A good moisturizer for all,This is a moisturizer that I this everybody of all skin types should buy at least once. Is not harsh on skin and doesn’t mess with me acne-probe skin. I plan on repurchasing this many more times!
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,"Great hydrating moisturizer, but caused breakouts","I had been on the search for a glowy, hydrating moisturizer for my dehydrated skin and this was honestly it! It starts off like you’re putting water on your face but as you work it into your skin it is SO hydrating! Unfortunately, my acne prone skin did not like it and it caused a few breakouts. I won’t be using it again for that reason obviously but you should definitely try it and see how your skin reacts to it :)"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,Effective Moisturizer,"I was hoping to use this cream during the day, but it makes my face shiny a few hours after application; not oily but moist from the humectants in the formula. I use it at night with Inkey’s Retinol Serum and it works great!"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,New Zealand,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING !!!,"I am in love with this moisturiser, it melted into my skin instantly, it has a slight cooling effect which is amazing, but dude my skin texture became so much smoother so quick I am so happy with this 100% recommend, I am quite oily in my t zone, this is a lightweight moisturiser that doesn’t leave my skin feeling dehydrated and my cheeks are quite dry and yet it did awesome at hydrating. 
"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,Love the lightweight formula! Usually only wear during the day and use another cream at night. Have been using for about a month and have noticed a lot more hydration in my skin.
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,Miss,"I have just started to use this cream after switching from another brand. I really like the consistency, it’s light but very hydrating!"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,New Zealand,Lightweight moisturiser!,"Lovely lightweight moisturiser! Feels light but also moisturising! Only fault is that it dries matte. But if you’re looking for a nice moisturiser for summer or to layer under makeup, this is the one for you! "
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,Basic moisturizer for me,"Not bad did not irritate my skin which is really good. But did not help with my redness.
But I think I would not repurchase this product.
There are better ones from the inkey list."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,Good texture but make my skin oily and I had many pimples few days ago
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,Not greatl,It was good at first but after a while it turned my face bright red and really irritated it. overall it dried out my skin and it definitely isn’t good for someone with sensitive skin i wouldn’t recommend as a hydrating product 
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,Not worth it,Did not moisturize enough. Disappointing because I purchased after the reviews said it’s great for sensitive skin. Was left with dryness an hour after application
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,"This face cream is lightweight
Which makes it perfect for summer! 
Definitely recommend to anyone looking for something light,non greasy,moisturizing, and leaving your face with a nice glow"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,Not too bad ,"The Inkey List Omega Water Cream is hydrating and nice for my dry sensitive skin, however it isn’t hyrating enough. It does its job but my skin still feels bit dry after 10-15 mins "
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,"I don’t usually write reviews, but this is the worst moisturizer I have ever used it’s not for skin with pores or acne. It will make you breakout more. Since I used it I been breaking out none stop, but now that I stopped using it, i stopped breaking out."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,SO GOOD!,"This product is so good! The texture is simply the best, it feels amazing on and it does the job so well. I am oily and I can use it day and night, but would recommend to use nights only on very hot days since it is a bit more moisturizing. For the price tag and ingredients’ list you can’t bit it. SO GOOD!"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Malaysia,light and moisture,loooooveeeee should hrab this one and love ittttt very hydarting and yeahhhh must try and hope it suitable for guys tooooo and purchase during saleee so worth it
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,Not for sensitive acne prone skin. Will break you out.
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,Pretty Lightweight,is a good lightweight moisturizer at its price point. However my face often feels as if it wasn’t actually moisturized after applying the amount per the instructions.
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Malaysia,Instant Love ,"I love this product so much I placed another order after using it for a day. It’s lightweight but moisturising, perfect for my oily dehydrated combination skin. If you always feel most moisturisers are too greasy and gel moisturisers aren’t moisturising enough, give this a try cos it’s a great balance between a water gel and water cream gel. Wears well under sunscreen and makeup. "
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,feels super oily and heavy which is odd considering it’s literally an oil free moisturizer
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Australia,FAVORITE,"Obsessed with this moisturiser will keep repurchasing because it is just that good. The formula is a gel consistency which is perfect for combination skin like mine and is super hydrating without a greasy feel not to mention the price point, Highly recommend for normal to oily skin!!
 "
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,"honestly i loved it at first, great price. after 1 week of using this it made me so greasy and oily, i have combo skin and when i would apply this under makeup this would make my nose, forehead and chin makeup slide right off because of how oily this was,"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,Great for my combination skin!,"I have been LOVING this moisturizer so far, I have combination skin (I tend to be oily just more towards the corners of my nose) and this moisturizer made my skin feel moisturized but not to the point where I felt excessively oily which i loved. It’s a long lasting moisturizer that doesn’t dry out super quick so it keeps my skin moisturized all through the day! Will definitely be repurchasing!"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Malaysia,Lightweight,"Basic, fragrance free, lightweight moisturiser that is easy to apply on the face and blend with facial oil. Non sticky and perfect to wear during the day. Reasonably priced too!"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Malaysia,skincare ,It’s such an amazing product leaves your skin with a glow and feels so light on the skin almost feels like you have nothing on and it’s such an amazing product even for people with oily skin 
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Malaysia,moisturising and not irritating ,"What I like the most in this product is that it is not irritating. It does not contain any fragrance and it feels comfy to use. For my acne prone skin, this doesn’t feel sticky at all. "
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,good value price,One of the good moisturizers I have tried not heavy on the skin keeps skin just the right hint of moisture without making a you look like your sweating
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,"Not good at all for oily skin, very disappointed as this is the first Inlet product I purchased"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Malaysia,Super soothing and gentle,"The Omega Water Cream has a light gel-cream 
texture which feels refreshing and super comfortable on my skin delivering an instant hydration hit. It quenches my dehydrated skins thirst effectively whilst absorbing quickly without leaving an unwanted greasy or oily feeling. A little goes a long way and a small amount spreads easily leaving skin feeling soft, smooth and through consistent use a more even skin tone.  I love that it plumps my skin leaving it looking healthier and with that hint of dewiness which I love.  "
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,"Great product. I was skeptical at first because of the reviews but it works great. It is creamy, not oily, and doesn’t dry out."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,"it’s so beyond average. didn’t do much, wasn’t smoothing or glowy. should be lovely if you have super oily skin."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,"it works really well, i have oily skin and it’s not greasy. Feels very very lightweight almost like a face primer but i like it a lot especially for the price!"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,"Not for oily, acne prone skin.","I have oily, acne prone skin and have been using the Ordinary's HA moisturizer for a while but figured I would give the Inkey list omega water cream moisturizer a try since I felt that the ordinary's moisturizer wasn't providing quite enough hydration, leaving my skin feeling slightly too dry. The omega water cream says it's good for oily skin but it left my skin extremely shiny, more oily, and led to increased breakouts. I stopped using after a week and my skin has cleared back up and gone back to my usual amount of oiliness. I don't recommend this for people with oily, acne prone skin."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,Its okay,"This is the first Inkey list product I have rated anything less than 5. This is a very lightweight moisturizer that I feel truly sinks into the skin. Saying that, I also feel despite the fact it sinks in, I cannot say it makes my skin feel overly hydrated/soft. To me it is ""meh"" but its great for the price and I love Inkey list, not sure if I would buy again though."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,Might Buy Again,"I like the way it almost melts in your hands before applying. It’s definitely moisturizing, but it leaves a bit of a greasy feel afterwards? That’s the main thing keeping it from a five star rating. That greasy feeling makes it feel a bit heavy after it sits and sinks into your skin."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,Bang for the Buck!,"Such an amazing light-weight, dewy moisturizer for the summer. My skin is glowing."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,Good Moisturizer,"Nice product - a little heavier/more dewy than preferred for daytime for my oily skin in the summer.  Doesn't make me breakout, and works well with SPF and makeup.  I think this will be better for use in the colder months and/or for people with a little less oily skin.  I also feel like I go through this product very quickly, so I'm not sure if the value is fully there, even though it's a more affordable price point.  If I need to replace after just a few weeks, then it might not be as ""affordable"" as it seems."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,"It’s a good generic moisturizer, and the texture is somewhat similar to Tatcha’s water cream. My only complaint is that it leaves my skin feeling a little sticky, and I find that I get oily quickly after using it."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,Great water cream,I’m really loving this moisturizer! I love how it’s lightweight and you can feel the moisture sink in as you apply it. It leaves a dewy finish and keeps my combo skin moisturized all day.
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,Affordable and great for combination skin,My skin is either extremely dry or extremely oily and this has helped balance that. It’s light weight so it doesn’t cause me to get super oily and break out. it’s also super hydrating so my skin doesn’t feel tight and doesn’t hurt
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,Amazing moisturizer that isn't super heavy,I love and swear by The Inkey List products.  They work great and are affordable. the only reason I am giving this a 4/5 is it doesn't smell the greatest.   It does a bit of that dermatologist medicated smell.   But that is easy enough to deal with as I also use the Herbivore Coconut water mist (which smells great)
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,"Watch out if you have sensitive, acne prone skin.","I have acne prone skin and right when I started using this I started breaking out. I stopped using it 4 days ago after using it for 2 weeks, and I'm still getting little clogged pores coming up! So annoying."
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Malaysia,UNDERRATED MOISTURISER,"The underrated product from this brand. I think this is the best moisturiser for oily skin and didn't makes me breakout. It glides so well and absorbed pretty quick. On top of that, it leaves the skin non-greasy feeling. Just give it a shoot! "
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,USA,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,for me this is a great dupe for the tatcha water cream!! It’s a great price point and the quality is great overall I have recommended this to everyone that needs a good quality moisturizer for a price that doesn’t break the bank. It gives a beautiful refreshed look and soaks up really well over night
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,New Zealand,Highly recommend,I signed up to Sephora just to get this product that I've seen recommended all over Tiktok in the UK. I am so happy that it's very affordable. It is very light and will be perfect for summer. I have been using it on my face post-laser when I want something that won't irritate my skin. Highly recommend this Omega Water Cream.
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,so amazing works amazing exactly what the product is supposed to be love it.
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Canada,The Inkey List Omega Water Cream,"I’m actually so surprised this doesn’t have many more great reviews. It is so nice on my skin. I love it, definitely a good one!!"
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Malaysia,hydration to its limit ,I have oily skin and I found this moisturiser hydrating and it has a light consistency. It didn’t have a particular scent and did not make my sensitive skin irritated or break out 
THE INKEY LIST-Omega Water Cream,Malaysia,Very lightweight ,It’s very lightweight and refreshing. Highly recommend. Is not oily and doesn’t feel too much when you put spf on. Definitely will be purchasing again. 
LAURA MERCIER-Skin Essentials Collection,Singapore,Laura Mercier Basic Set,"Thanks to this Laura Mercier 4 pcs set, it started my LM journey, thereafter buying & using the translucent loose powder & brushes. lash curler is also another must buy, uts so professionally curled too."
LAURA MERCIER-Skin Essentials Collection,Singapore,great starter kit ,cleanser and micellar water are full sized. moisturiser and eye cream are so tiny!! starter kit is affordable and i’m so excited to try! heard good reviews about it 
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,Canada,excellent,"Definitely one of my top favourite moisturizers, leaves my skin feeling so clear and soft. Smells nice too."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,Canada,Plump it up!,"I love this cream, having repurchased after testing with a mini size. It's now my daytime go-to cream.

The actives aren't super well listed in the description but they're in there: Cloubberry (tightening, brightening Vitamin C) Hyaluronic acid for hydration, rice protein, cermaides for protection and and plumping peptides all make my skin feel and look great (hello tone and fullness!) 

It feels nice and cooling going on with a whipped texture that absorbs well. My 37 y.o. skin always feels plumped up and firm when I use it, and it leaves my face soft and hydrated but not greasy. I find it works well over daytime serums, and have paired it with Vitamin C and peptide serums.  

The scent is mild and kind of citrus/orange-y which I like. I use it for daytime but it could be rich enough to use at night unless you want something heavier. 

I just love it!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,Canada,Holy Grail Daytime Moisturizer,"I've repurchased this face cream several times and I really like it. The cream is hydrating and plumping without being sticky or greasy. As someone with normal-combo skin, this is perfect in the summer because it dries down naturally, but is still hydrating enough to use in the winter. If you have dry or oily skin I think it would still work quite well too! If you're sensitive to fragrance you might not like the light orange smell, but it has never broken me out or caused any irritation."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,Canada,Canola oil?! Seriously?!!,Even Kylie Skin has better ingredients than this (and I wouldn’t even recommend buying anything from that line even if it was 95% off on sale). I’m becoming more and more disappointed with the Sephora Clean label after discovering so many awful ingredients in the clean products. I’ll stick to Caudalie and tatcha. This is getting out of hand!
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,Canada,skyn Iceland Pure Cloud Cream,This is my favourite moisturizer. It feels rich and nourishing without being heavy and it smells amazing. You don’t need very much and a container lasts quite a while (which makes it a little more affordable). I live in a dry climate and use it at night in the summer and both morning and night in the winter.
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,Canada,skyn Iceland Pure Cloud Cream,I didn’t really like this but am using it up. Skyn used to have a gel cream but it seems to be discontinued or at least not carried by Sephora so I ordered this instead. Too “thick” for my liking and leaves a heavy feeling on my skin after I apply it. Am using it as a body cream instead to finish it up
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,Singapore,Like Cloud,"The product itself are very moisturizing but somehow probably suitable for wintertime. I have dehydrated skin, this product are moisture for my skin whenever I feel like using it. Maybe once in a week."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,Canada,skyn Iceland Pure Cloud Cream,"Has a berry smell to it...strong at first. It’s an odd texture...definitely “cloud like”, a little goes a long way and not creamy. Really unsure...I think I prefer one of their other moisturizers."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,Canada,LOVELY TEXTURE!,"Love this! The texture is so good: not greasy, not heavy but very hydrating. It smells delightful as well."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,Canada,Lovely texture and great result,"I really appreciate the subtle nature of this cream - the consistency is light and airy (clouds!) and it feels very luxurious while not instigating any skin irritation at all. However, the potency just doesn’t quite cut it for me - I have dry, sensitive skin and live in a very dry place. I use it with facial oil, hylauronic acid, and still use heavy night balms. But all around - good product. Will probably like this more in the summer!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,Canada,irritated skin? this is for you!!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) i bought this after getting an online sample with my order and LOVING IT. honestly incredible if you have easily irritated skin. whenever i do any exfoliating treatments i use this at night and my skin is SO supple the next morning. it calms any redness like you wouldn’t believe. wish it was a bit cheaper considering there aren’t any major active ingredients in this that would contribute to price, but keeping at 5 stars since it does exactly what it says it does!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,Canada,Perfect for Oily Skin !,"I have very sensitive skin, which tends to be oily in warmer weather and dry in cold weather.
This cloud cream is light, rich and is instantly absorbed, leaving your skin plump, hydrated and NOT GREASY at all! 

Highly recommend this product!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,Canada,Great Stuff!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I’m very picky with my skin cream and I got this as a sample and loved it! It’s not thin but thicker and creamy. Perfect for winter months when your trying to combat dry skin. Highly recommend.
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Fantastic,"My new favourite daytime moisturizer! I bought it because I had a good experience with their eye gel packs and face masks, and I was not disappointed.  After using this for a couple of weeks, I misplaced it, and used my dermalogica skin smoothing cream (my previous standard), and I just couldn't believe the difference.  It has kind of a weird, bouncy, jelly texture, so I use a bit more than with other moisturizers, but it is so fantastic, I don't even care anymore.  What a great line of skin care products!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,,Good product but not for me,"Great consistency and smell, and felt nice applying it. Definitely did what it claims and was very moisturising, but it made my skin break out after a week or two. Used it instead on rough spots on my body and it still worked.

If anyone is interested in purchasing this, I'd say you should still give it a shot. It just really didn't work for my skin."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,Canada,Love it,Absolutely love this - absorbs into the skin without an oily feel.  Leaves my skin soft and supple
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,Canada,give it a try !,"Definitely give this product a try. 
When I first tried it, I got it as a trial size sample from Sephora. You would’ve thought the tube was empty because of how light this moisturizer is. I saw my face clearing up within a few days of using it, purchased a full size. 
Now 1 year Later, I’m still using this product it’s in my permanent rotation. The jar is glass, nice and heavy. Luxurious feeling. The lotion itself- a little goes a long way. A little dime size amount on your finger can do your whole face, I do this twice for added moisture during winter months. It gets sucked right into your skin, and your face feels incredibly soft. I also use the Glacial Wash from Skyn Iceland, or the AHA/BHA exfoliating cleanser. I feel my skin is softer, younger looking with the combination of these products. 
You will get 2-4 months worth of use with this 1oz jar. Depending on how much you use, and of course seasonally the amount of applications will increase for most of us during the cold months. 
The only reason why I give it 4 instead of 5. Is packaging. I really like the tube sample I had where I could squeeze out the small amount that was needed and go, or have it in my purse etc etc. 
This jar although lux feeling, is big, heavy, so I don’t like to travel with it, glass I’m always afraid of banging my purse off something. But I think what bothers me the most is just the bacteria from putting my fingers in the jar throughout the day. I think if it was put inside a squeeze tube, 5star product for sure!! 

Oh I have incredibly sensitive skin, it always seems to be irritated. I feel my current skincare regimen with this product in it, has certainly helped come that. I’m combination of dry-oily. Dryer on my cheeks and forehead, oily on my nose. I use this all over the face, it doesn’t feel greasy at all on the oily parts of my face. 
Love y’all have a great day, hope my
Review is thoroughly helpful!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Beautiful texture,Pretty good cream. The texture is sublime! Feels so luxurious when spreading this across face. It does its job well. Moisturizing and hydrating!
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Great.,"I got this as a sample and it was amazing for my skin. Made it super soft! Little goes a long way, I will most definitely be buying this product!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,First Aid Cream,This is not only a great moisturizer but it also aids in healing the skin irritation from using a depilatory cream. I would definitely recommend and repurchase!
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,"Amazing cream, awful packaging.",I would give this 5 stars if it was in a pump or tube (the sample is in a tube and is so much better). the jar format is unhygienic and out dated!
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,totally gonna spend the money on it.,"this stuff is amazing. i got a sample of it and im deffiently gonna buy it now. i have eczema, rosacea and my skin is ance prone, this stuff makes my skin feel so relaxed and doesnt flair anything up for me. this combined with tea tree oil as a spot treatment and its the first time ive had clear skin since i was 17."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,skyn Iceland Pure Cloud Cream,"Another great Skyn Iceland product! Light, barely scented and a little goes a long way for my combination skin. I use this with the serum and love the feel. I use this more in drier weather and on my neck too. Love!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,My favorite product from Skyn Iceland.,This is my favorite cream.  It has a very nice fragrance. Very moisturizing.
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,skyn Iceland Pure Cloud Cream,"Smells great and a little goes a long way. My face definitely feels hydrated after using it, however on hot summer days I feel like I get oily faster."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,BROKE ME OUT BADLY,"Broke me out over one single night:( super disappointed, my acne’s we’re getting better so I gave this a try hoping it could help my skin a bit more. Nope, brought me back to last year now my forehead s super bumpy, hope it goes away soon. SUPER DISAPPOINTED"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,A M A Z I N G,"I got a trail size in an Ipsy bag, and absolutely fell in love. the best moisturizer ive found for my skin, even though its quite pricey for someone like myself. I bought a full sized, and while the scent was a bit different, it worked exactly the same. I have combo- dry skin and it was such an amazing nighttime moisturizer, and it worked well under makeup as well!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,skyn Iceland Pure Cloud Cream,"I got this as a sample with my VIB points, and man I really stumbled upon a staple. It’s light, non greasy, soothing, and extremely moisturizing. I have insanely sensitive skin and it immediately smooths over any dry patches I have and even helps reduce the texture of the pores on my nose. If I continue to love it i’ll definitely invest to get the full size."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Best moisturizer for all skin types,"I've now used up all of this product and I have nothing bad to say about it. I purchased it at the end of last summer when my skin was more combination and acne proned. When my skin was at it's worst I used this and it made my skin so hydrated and almost calmed my skin. Now as the year progressed my skin became more normal to dry and I still used this and never had a complaint. It goes on and absorbes quickly leaving your skin so beautiful, soft and hydrated. It works under makeup it works as a night time moisturizer it does everything."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,skyn Iceland Pure Cloud Cream,This a nice day cream. I use it after putting a serum on my face and it goes on smoothly and has a really nice light fresh smell that doesn’t irritate my skin.
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,great cream for sensitive skin!,Really helped sooth my sensitive skin and moisturize without leaving a greasy feel. This stuff absorbs quick! Leaving my skin looking and feeling super soft and smooth
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,skyn Iceland Pure Cloud Cream,"I received a free sample of this product and I love it. It's so moisturizing it truly does feel like a cloud and it smells amazing. For the price, I'm not sure that I would repurchase it but the sample was amazing while it lasted"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,skyn Iceland Pure Cloud Cream,Giving it 5 out of 5 stars! It is so moisturizing and calms my rosacea prone skin down. A great one to apply before bed.
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Great non-greasy face cream,"I've been searching for an all natural cruelty free moisturizer for a long time. All the other ones I have tried feel like they just sit on my skin. By mid day I feel like I need to wash my face. Not this cream! It's amazing, absorbs quickly, isn't greasy or sticky and great to apply make up over.  Smells nice too!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Clouds,"This cream is quite good, its delicate, fluffy, soft, not greasy, smells like citrus-like, and is white colored, which means its rather pure. I like what it does to my skin, make it soft, however, it did not do much for wrinkles such as crows feet or my 11's. Therefore, i took off a star."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,In Love,I use this everyday and night under a serum and between their two products my skin has almost no break outs at all. My skin is so super sensitive this is like a miracle all on it's own. This cream is so light and fluffy and a little tiny bit goes such a long ways I will be buying this again! Plus it really helps my face out when i get peels or harsh treatments done. True life saver!
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Souffle Texture amazing!!!!!!,This cream is really amazing I have used it day and night it is one of the first creams that has not broke my skin out and it has an awsome light citrus smell which is not fake and I love that. The texture amazes me it is like a souffle cream it is so unique like if you just touch the cream in the jar it is almost bouncy like jello and when you scoop alittle out it is so whipped and souffle like. I apply this every where on my face and neck and my skin is glowing I love it It has a slight cooling effect when you are massing it into the skin and it is refreshing. I have put off purchasing this for awhile because of the price im 19 so I dont usually have 65 bucks to spend on a face cream but do no let the price keep you from purchasing because you get a big jar and it will last for quite a while even with daily use. 5 stars it is so good.
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Good product,"Light as air, non greasy, nicely scented moisturizer. The only thing holding me back from giving it five stars is the price!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Gorgeous and delicious!,"I love this day cream. It says it is unscented, but it actually has a lovely light scent of fresh oranges. It goes on super smoothly and absorbs quickly. It makes my skin feel so healthy! I'm also pretty sure it helps prevent breakouts, since it has a slightly exfoliating effect. Works for me. It's a disaster when I run out."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Soothes and Comforts Stressed Skin,"I have combination skin, and my cheeks and nose can get really dry and even peeling during the winter. Since I loved my Skyn Iceland ""Oxygen Infusion Night Cream"" so much, I wanted to try a more intensive cream from that line. This cream really does everything it promises: it glides on smoothly, it's easy to blend, it absorbs quickly and it has the pleasant smell like orange peels.

This is one of the most intensive hydrating face creams I've ever used, It's soothing and effective at diminishing dry skin, Plus, it's so gentle and non-irritating that it heals peeling skin (either from dryness or even mild sunburn) in a few days. Also, when I wake up the next morning after using this cream, I can't believe how soft my face feels! This cream is very expensive, but you get a pretty good size jar for your money, and since a little of it goes a long way, I think it ends up being a good value.

My only complaint about this cream is its lack of versatility. Since my skin is on the oily side in the summer, I have to use a mattifying moisturizer, because this cream doesn't really help prevent breakouts. But I'm always glad to have this on hand in the winter when my skin is dry, and it would be ideal for someone with extremely dry and/or sensitive skin."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Miracle Cream,"Even in my mid 40's I tend to break out. When that happens, I tend to freak out and do everything I can to dry the spots which usually results in red, irritated skin. This cream makes it all goes away. My skin is calm and the redness is gone. I use this cream everyday and I put on a thicker coat right before bed. Love the way my skin looks and the dreaded breakouts occur less and less."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Excellent moistuizer,"Light, smooth, creamy and it WORKS!! With the hot steamy months here you want a light but working daily moisturizer and Pure Cloud delivers. I actually use a bit on the back of my hands too. It is non greasy, non shiny, non sticky moisturizer that works."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,skin soothing,Amazing stuff. I use it after chemical peels and mostly recently during the day after I use Retin-A. It completely hides flakiness from both treatments and makes my skin look fresh and non irritated. Good under sunscreen as well. Sephora had the product just last week..I think they get a few in at a time. I was a little irritated when I read other reviews saying that Sephora was no longer going to carry it just because it was out of stock. I ordered two from another site...come back to sephora.com for something else and it's back in stock. It just sells quickly. I really wish people wouldn't speculate though..I could've had 130 more beauty insider points.
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,"Excellent, but Sephora No Longer Carries It","I have used this moisturizer on my dry sensitive skin for six months and my skin has never looked better. It's soft, calm, and bright. Unfortunately, Sephora has elected to no longer carry Skyn products - I don't know why. I tried different moisturizers thinking that I'd just switch: Boscia, DDF, Clinique, Sephora instant moisturizer. Each of them made me break out and I ended up just purchasing from somewhere else online. It's a shame Sephora doesn't sell it any more."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,"LOVE THIS, bummed Sephora no longer carries it","This was my go-to moisturizer. LOVED the texture, subtle citrus scent, and the relief it provided to my uber-sensitive skin. I'm quite puzzled as to why Sephora will no longer carry it, so I must now buy it elsewhere."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,skyn Iceland Pure Cloud Cream,Feels great on my skin. I wish the scent was a little lighter but it isn't overpowering. I definitely recommend.
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Love it!,It smells really nice. And it goes on thick and rich without any greasiness. The best I've used in a long time.
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,"Perfect for irritated, dry skin","This is great! I tried a few samples -- I had been wanting to try the Pure Cloud Cream for quite some time. My skin tends to be dry, and it's slightly irritated from a recent change in prescription retinoids. This cream is immediately calming and soothing, and it absorbs quickly and completely, leaving no trace of residue -- perfect for AM and PM use. At first, I was convinced I wasn't using enough, but it really just absorbs that well. As an added bonus, it smells amazing. I will definitely have to invest in the full sized product!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,the package doesn't lie.,"problem i was having: dry, red, flaky skin on my face due to cold, lack of humidity, retinol use, and a boyfriend who can never get a close shave. this cream soothed, softened, and healed my poor face. it combines serious skin TLC with a lightweight, non-greasy, quick-absorbing formula. a little pricey, but totally worth the splurge if you're serious about skincare."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Lightweight moisturizer,"This creamy moisturizer is ideal for very sensitive skin. It is lightweight and non-greasy. If you live in a dry area of the country, you may have to apply several layers. I use it morning and night with the Antidote SPF 18 during the day. If you like the other Skyn Iceland products, you will like this one as well."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Feels wonderful,"Cool and healing on application....I have dry, sensitive skin and this is very comforting!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,LOVE how my skin feels,"This cream is WAY beyond the price I have ever shelled out so I returned to Sephora 4x to try it to make sure I wasn't being too impetuous. My favourite characteristic of this cream is that it doesn't sit on top of your skin like a thin film of oil. My skin is breathing & feels soft & silky. It has a light citrusy scent, remiscent of vitamins and isn't overwhelming in its perfume. If anyone remembers Lancome's TOUCHE ECLAT, this is very similar... LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,skyn Iceland Pure Cloud Cream,"this is a very rich and luxurious cream that i've started using since the seasons have changed. it makes my skin feel balanced and hydrated - never oily. smells lovely.
i use it in combination with Juice Beauty anitoxidant serum."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Nice,"This is a good moisturizer for my skin type (dry and acne-prone). It does not cause me any break-outs. The only thing is that it does not seem to fully absorb into my skin and is not quite moisturizing enough. But it doesn't break me out and smells good, so it's good enough for me!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Sooo Good!,"wonderfully light & creamy. not like some moisturizers, perfect for combo skin. Just enough moisture that really works unlike other products that sit on the surface ike an oil spill!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Light yet effective,I love how light the cream feels when you apply it and how thoroughly it absorbs/moisturizes. This is very effective for me living in Vegas with a very dry climate and oily/combination skin. I even put this right up to the lashes sometimes (instead of using an eye cream) and it doens't burn/sting. It's a relatively small amount of product in the container but I've found I don't need very much -- just pat/dab your finger on the cream then smooth onto your skin.
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Not enough moisture for my dry skin,"While this Pure Cloud Cream smells amazing and has a nice feel on the skin, it is far too light for someone with very dry skin (like me). I found that after using it I needed to re-apply b/c my face would feel too dry not long after the first application.

I do like that this is a natural product and it smells wonderful. It also wears well under makeup. However, if you have dry skin, I do not recommend a product that is this lightweight."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Lovely,"I bought this to heal my dry skin & fend off my fine lines. Its only been 2wks. And my complexion, glows, tightens, and is hydrated. Fine lines less noticeable even when I have a fresh washed face. Keep in mind there's no SPF in this cream. I let the cream sit for 10mins. then apply my SPF, then my make-up. At night after I apply I occasionally add BAG BALM or vaseline at the outer corners of my eyes, forehead and entire mustache area. Only because I grew up with dewy moisturizers and I need to feel that. Also it helps to sleep on a satin pillow case. Bottom-line this cream does what it says and check out the whole line, I am. Enjoy."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Love it,"Ever since I started using this product, my face has felt softer and I've had less breakouts. I am faithful to both the cloud cream and the face wash in this line. I love them both and I don't imagine that I will ever have to switch to anything else."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,pure cloud cream,"I bought this cream took home and couldn't believe how small it was for $82.
Nothing wrong with it . The store gave me sample it was great too little for to much"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Good stuff,Nice and light - mild slightly sweet aroma - Sulfite-free
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Cloud 9!!!,"It takes a lot to impress me on a beauty product! This is a very ""healthy"" ingredient driven cream with an amazing texture and nice results. Perfect for day or night for my normal (sometimes leaning towards dry) skin in a midwest summer. I can use this in a midwest winter but I need to layer with serum or on top of the antidote. Great product for a reasonable price- 1.7oz is generous! I'm on my 3rd or 4th jar already and I use loads of other skincare."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Best moisturizer ever,"I first bought this moisturizer in the winter when my skin was red, irritated and dry. My skin was immediatly calmed and rehydrated. It has a great cooling sensation when you put it on and keeps your skin from looking oily."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,"Red, Red, and Red",Made my face bright red after use.
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Works okay.,Loved the sample. It works well for the dryness around my mouth. But I do have to use it sparingly or I get the breakouts. The cream seems to separate in the full size version. I have to mix it up a little before dabbing it on. Maybe that's what causes the reaction the sample didn't. I'd return it but it's hard finding a moisturizer that soothes the skin when it gets irritated by other products.
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,smells good,"Im not going to buy this again, it smelled really really good, but it left my face oily and did not clean the fine lines like I would prefer moisturizer to do."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,A Dream in the Clouds,"This is amazing and worth every penny. I use it when my skin is thirsty or stressed. Gentle, yet amazingly effective!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Feels cool to the skin going on.  A treat!,"The best part about this skin cream is the cooling sensation you feel on your skin when you apply it. You also don't need to use very much so it makes the purchase price well worth it. It won't correct very dry skin, though. So if you need a lot of moisture, this is not for you. I find it perfect for the warmer months of the year, though, when there is more humidity in the air where I live."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,A must-have for harsh winter & dry climatic areas,"I love it and love it. It's a keeper for those who have really dry skin or who live in harsh winter seasons or in dry climatic areas. I bought this cream but since I live in Houston and its hot here. I have a combination skin, so this cream felt oily on my skin because of warm climate here. But in winter its a must-have!!! It's effective, intensive and very hydrating but somehow it felt oily on forehead and nose (T-zone area). So I had to return it."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Love at First Try ;D,"I got this as part of the free 10 skin care sample kit. This cream is a VERY LIGHT and airy cream which works very well for me. I usually find creams too heavy and greasy. If you need a heavy cream then this product is not for you.

As far as the scent... I love love love it. The product doesn't have any added fragrance so this must come from a natural product. The scent is citrus (reminds me of grapefruit) and I simply adore it. When I put this on in the morning it gives me a pick me up with those feel good endorphins!

The price seems a little steep but I was so impressed that I will definitely buy full size regardless! Try it you won't regret it."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Over-hyped,"I thought this cream would be perfect for the dry Alberta winters, but when I got a sample of this back in January, I learned otherwise. The sales associate did say that it was hydrating, but it will cause breakouts. I was shocked that she was still giving me this, b/c I was having a bit of an ""acne-attack"" at the time, but she said it was good for the winter. She was bang on with the breakouts! I did not find that this cream was as rich as she said it would be, but it's certainly not as light as the description will have you think. My mom has sensitive skin, and she used it once, and threw out the rest, as she could not use it a second time."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,cloud cream is amazing!!!!!!,"I got this cream in the hopes it would calm down my angry skin- and it did just that!!!!!it absorbs quicly and does a phenomenal job of balancing my combination skin, which was a very nice and unexpected bonus. I absolutely recommend this product for anyone needing a calming, out of this world moisturizing experience!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,skyn Iceland Pure Cloud Cream,This cream is light and cool to the skin. Not as hydrating as I would like but I have sensitive skin and this product does not irriitate at all. Lightly scented. Feels great going on. Need to apply a little more often than your normal moisturizer.
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Not worth the money,"I was't pleased with this product at all. I was told that it was the best and would make my skin feel great, but it dried my face out completetly. My skin was worse after using it than before, so it's not worth that money to me"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Excellent face moisturizer,Works well in the Colorado winter. Light but richly moisturizing. Not irritating at all. Highly recommend.
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Dreamy,"I love this cream for times when my skin gets really dry. I like the way it feels -- soothing, not heavy."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Excellent,Very moisturizing and feels so light and airy. LOVEEEE IT. Expensive but then this IS my second time buying it :)
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Dehydrated fruit!,"I asked for a recommendation for my skin, which is sensitive and very dry due to chemotherapy. I was given this, which felt wonderful on my hand. I bought it, and for three days, my skin was beautiful. Then I noticed some dry patches. Within the next two days, my face looked as if I'd stuck it in a fruit dehydrator. Unfortunately, I'd already recycled the original box, and I still haven't managed to get my skin rehydrated, even after three treatments of pure grapeseed oil. Horrible product."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Cloud Cream puts my skin on cloud nine!,"I used to avoid moisturizer because I believed that they just clogged your pores and made you break out. Boy was I wrong! I started using this cream at the suggestion of a Sephora rep. and my skin has never looked better! My skin is now soft, bright, and healthy looking. Every time I wash my face I follow up with Pure Cloud Cream. It is expensive, but the volume of moisturizer lasts a long time. I use it 2x a day and it still lasts me three or four months to use it up."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,HAPPY FACE,I REALLY LIKE THIS MOISTURIZING CREAM :) LIGHT AND MY SKIN FEELS AND LOOKS FRESH GREAT PURCHASE WELL WORTH THE MONEY
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,nice and light cream,"Great for not feeling heavy, nicely keeps skin moisturized and supple all day. A little goes a long way. No overpowering fragrance. Overall a great moisturizing cream."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Lighter than air,"This cream is incredible. I thought hard and choked down the fact I paid $75 for such a small size but it's worth it! This feels like a veil of heaven when applied. The fragrance is reminiscent of lemon. My sensitive, easily irritated face feels spa-pampered and protected by Pure Cloud Cream. This product is extraordinary and well worth the indulgence. You will not be disappointed."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,"Great, but not perfect","I liked this stuff and used every last bit of it, but I didn't buy it again because it's only moderately moisturizing. It does absorb quickly and feels nice, though. I occasionally felt a bit of a sting if I used it after exfoliating, but otherwise it didn't bother my sensitive skin. If my skin was normal instead of dry, I'd likely continue using this product."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Heaven in a Jar,"So one day I forgot to wear sunscreen in the middle of May and I got burnt to a crisp. Walking into my local Sephora on a Saturday, I captured my eyes upon this beauty in a jar. After putting on this cream and wearing it twice a day for four days straight I was free of sunburn and even better, had no flaking or no feeling! All a true story.

Truly a miracle cream. Hands down my favorite."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Worth every penny,"I got this in a sample after falling in love with the eye cream. I gave it a whirl one night, and WOW! My dry, irritated skin transformed overnight into soft, radiant skin.

I've used heavier, creamier night creams in the past, so the gel consistency kind of threw me at first. The trick is to just pat your fingertips into the product and pat and gently rub this on. (It doesn't absorb well if you slather it on and massage like a traditional cream.)

Will buy another jar just as soon as this one runs out... but I've had it forever and no sign of that happening yet!"
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,LOVE,Best moisturizer I have ever owned. On the expensive side and so I am still on the search for a cheaper alternative. I have dry patches this helped and it calmed my acne prone skin. Still the occasional hormonal break out but come on...its not Accutane.
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,meh,"Weird, I saw a reviewer below who had almost the same experience as me.

I received this as a sample from beauty insiders purchase, and I tried it and loved it. Mind you, my skin is horribly sensitive and doesn't like any sort of change. I used the sample and my skin LOVED it. It moisturized well, felt like buttah on my face, and it didn't make me break out. After I bought it, I realized that the tip of my nose was still super dry, and I started to break out.

Had to return :("
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Great for sensitive skin!,"I have sensitive skin that becomes irritated and red very easily, and when I bought this it was IRRITATED!. It calmed down the redness and itchiness yet was not overly greasy. It absorbed quickly and was lightweight even though it was deeply moisturizing."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Clogged more pores,"I had tried a sample of this, and loved how soft it made my skin feel. After ordering a full-size jar, and using it for a few days, it clogged my pores. My chin and forehead were covered in little pimples. I stopped using it and my skin seems back to normal. The product says it is to soothe skin after having treatments/peels, and maybe it works better for people who do that."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,skyn Iceland Pure Cloud Cream,"Just perfect. So kind to combination skin, wonderfully moisturizing."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Cream Skyn-tatic,"I love this product. One of the rare finds that actually stands up to claims of being literally fragrance free and gentle on sensitive skin. Does a great job hydrating dry, winter skin. Not greasy at all. PERFECT under makeup or alone."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Not for the winter,"I have combination skin, oily in the summer and dry in the winter. Bought for the winter and it didn't moisturize enough. I also have roscea and the sales women said it would reduce my redness, which it did not. I return the product."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,The Best Moisturizer In Sephora.....,"This is honestly the best moisturizer that I have found in Sephora. I work at one of the locations have the tried many moisturizers.

This one absorbs quickly, does not make you look greasy and keeps your fully hydrated all day.

This cream made my skin look more even, and less red. I would reccomend this for any skin type."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Light clouds,Very light cream - good for skin that's not too dry. Absorbs quickly and has a very pleasant very light citrus scent.
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,skyn Iceland Pure Cloud Cream,Pure Cloud Cream has a gentle cooling and calming effect on facial skin that is unbelievable and the fragrance is heavenly!
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Good,"Not my favorite product, but still a good one. This is a good moistuizer, and does not aggrevate my rosacea. I work outside everyday, and for me it does not moisturize enough, but I think it would be fine for someone who doesn't need something as extreme as I do. I have to use a lot, and it is kind of expensive. Overall a good product though."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Winter splendor for the face,"I live in a dry old apt with radiator heat, and I know I don't hydrate enough, and like many a worker bee, I love to over indulge on coffee too (dehydrating! bap!). This cream is soo lightweight and like a dose of special goodness in the am/pm. It's not too heavy on the skin at all and a little goes a long way."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,nice,"The Pure Cloud Cream is perfect. It hydrates well, eases the dryness and wrinkles, and feels good."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,Pure Cloud Cream,"I have been using this for one month and I still love it! My skin does not break out like it used to and it does not make my skin greasy. I don't usually pay this much for a cream, but I did spend this much trying the drugstore creams that did not work for me."
SKYN ICELAND-Pure Cloud Cream,USA,best face cream ever,I have extremely sensitive skin and this product works great for me. It has greatly reduced my redness and leaves my skin soft -- it smells great too!
CLINIQUE-Repairwear Laser Focus Night Line Smoothing Cream,Singapore,Hydrating,This moisturiser works well for a sensitive skin like mine. I have been using this since a year and it helps in maintaining my skin moisture. Definitely recommend this for people with sensitive skin. 
CLINIQUE-Repairwear Laser Focus Night Line Smoothing Cream,Singapore,second purchase,"As a night cream this works very well at keeping me hydrated, and my skin is still plump and dewy come morning. I love Clinique products as it is unscented, and there's no pretty floral scent to cover the chemicals."
CLINIQUE-Repairwear Laser Focus Night Line Smoothing Cream,Malaysia,Hydrating yet matte,This cream is always sold out! Love the hydrating feel yet matte finish. Even though it is a night cream I wear it during the day since I am inside my house most of the time. 
KOPARI-Coconut Water Moisture Cream,Malaysia,Very lightweight!,"I use this Moisturiser during day. I love the texture, very lightweight. Worth for the price. My husband love this because he has oily type of skin. Gonna repeat this again"
KOPARI-Coconut Water Moisture Cream,Malaysia,it is okay ,"Bought this during sales. Overall, it’s just an okay product which provide basic hydrating effect.  I don’t like it but don’t hate it either.  Unlikely to repurchase though. "
KOPARI-Coconut Water Moisture Cream,Malaysia,ms,Bad purchasing experience，disappoint product. It has very strong fragrance smell. Also the product I got the package seems like be opened and spread out，only left half amount in the bottle.
KOPARI-Coconut Water Moisture Cream,Malaysia,Ms,"It smells great and has a really light and refreshing texture. However, it doesn’t really absorb particularly well and did not do the job for my combination skin. "
KOPARI-Coconut Water Moisture Cream,Malaysia,Great product for beginners ,"It absorbs extremely fast and does moisturize my skin! This product is great for people who are just venturing into skincare. If you have extreme dry skin, then this is not for you. This is suitable for medium dry skin."
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,New Zealand,Beauty Sleep Cream,"This is a nice product, I like the packaging however towards the end the pump wouldn’t disperse the product that was left over so I had to unscrew the lid to use. This has a lovely scent and feels really nice on the skin and absorbs easily. I didn’t notice any difference in my skin and this also didn’t go well under makeup. I purchased this on sale but wouldn’t repurchase or recommend. "
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,New Zealand,good,Nice slim packaging with pump. Medium moisture good for my normal combo skin not too light or too heavy. Scent is like spicy ginger with a hint of lavender. 
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,Singapore,For Beauty Sleep ,Rich and nourishing moisturiser that leaves you with glowing skin in the morning. I usually mix this with one of the Pixi oils. Use this as part of a complete Pixi routine for optimum results.
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,Malaysia,"smells gorgeous, texture not greasy","Love the scent! Texture is surprisingly light and easily absorbed by skin. Was expecting something heavier for a night cream, but delighted it isn’t. My skin feels good, but not sure if it’s remarkably better."
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,,Light and creamy,Good product. Doesnt leave your skin feeling like you left something on the face overnight. Mild smell and the pump makes it easy to dispense and apply to your face.
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,,love this,This moisturizer is not bad. Use it every night and wake up with clear skin. Actually this brand moisturizer for day and night are both not bad. I love the texture. Not sticky at all. 
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,,Pixi Beauty Sleep Cream,Bought on impluse. Just wanna try the product. Been using it for weeks. Not sure if its a must-have-product. Personally wont repurchase as it doesnt seems to work for me. 
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,,lightweight and easy to use,"Easy application & smells pretty decent. Lightweight formula prevents it from getting too oily as well. Best paired with the pixi glow tonic. Packaging is also easy to manage & can squeeze to the very last drop 
"
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,,Great! ,"I love using this product at night! Consistency is thick and i love the smell of it. Comes with a pump but when it runs low, its hard to dispense from pump. "
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,,Broke me out ,"Used this twice in hopes of it working out for my skin but alas, both times the cream made me break out in painful cystic acne. Perhaps there are a couple of ingredients in it which aren’t suitable for my skin. For reference, my skin type is oily and sensitive. "
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,,Like it,I love the scent and texture. Feels light on my face and I like the slim design because it is easy to bring along on trips. Suitable for day and night.
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,,Beauty Sleep Cream - okay product ,"Don’t really see much difference in my skin after using it the next morning. Won’t probably get this the next time, will try another product of this pixi line. "
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,,Not sure what to feel about this,"My skin type is dry and sensitive. This product doesn’t seem to be hydrating enough for me. After applying, there’s a stinging sensation that lasts for about a minute? Not sure if it’s a good thing or a bad thing...won’t repurchase.
"
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,,Free offer from UK that I can't live without,My daughter bought me some Pixi glow/rose tonic in UK and got this beauty cream as a free gift.  I LOVE IT.  Have now bought three times and use it every night.  Smells amazing and is great on my skin.  Sinks right in and doesn't feel greasy at all.
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,,Compact,On the fence for this one. I like it because it comes in a tube with a pump and it’s compact for traveling. The cream is light and fast absorbing but I personally feel that it’s not nourishing enough as a night cream.
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,,PIXI  Beauty Sleep Cream,"Loving the product. Been using it AM & PM.
Absorbed into skin easily. Will introduce to others.
Gonna repurchase it soon.
Very small bottle though & packaging is not user friendly."
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,,Lee,"Purchased this together along with the Glow Serum from Pixi, love the products despite it leaving my face sticky after application as I wake up the next day with almost perfect skin!"
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,,"good morning, face","I have very dry skin and a few visible pores on the area near my nose. I use this in combination with my Kiehl’s night recovery serum. You’ll wake up with a really fresh, plump looking face. Super nice. Plus you don’t really need to put too much. I usually just use 1 to 1.5 pumps. And that’s enough to cover the entire face. Smells good too!
"
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,,amazing !,Love this product! Smells yummy and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and looking all dewy when i wake up in the morning. Im using the whole lot of the pixi line and i absolutely love it. Will definitely repurchase :)
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,,beauty cream must have,"I also love this product from pixi, it really smells good, it’s not sticky when you apply it on ur face and it’s very light. I does work like magic. My skin feels a lot smoother after using this beauty cream."
PIXI-Beauty Sleep Cream,,Good,"Absorbs into my skin even with my night routine of using the Rose Oil, however, noticed that Pixi's pumps can be improved and the volume of product could be more for daily usage. Sells as a rich treatment cream but does not feel greasy or ""heavy"" on skin. More experimenting required! "
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,Singapore,this is the best creammmmmm,"Love everything about this cream… it’s rich but not too rich .. as in not oily , absorb fast into my skin without feeling oily. I’m getting the serum to use it together soon. 
"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,Canada,Fave,"Favourite skincare line. It is expensive, but personally it has been the best product for my ‘aging’ skin."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,Canada,Worth every penny!,I have been using the Cru serum and cream for about two years now. Ive never had problems with the pumps nor does it leave anything in the bottle when I am finished. I started with a trial size pack and noticed a huge difference within a week. Wrinkles less visible and tone was more even. Previously I was using the vinosource cream for about 5 years. The Cru is a definite game changer and worth every penny IMO.
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,Singapore,clear and radiant skin,this is my second time purchasing the product.  I see improvement to my skin condition. i like that it is not tacky and is easily absorbed into the skin.
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,It smells like cigarette omg. Such an expensive. I just tried it and my face smells like someone just blew a smoke all over my face. Idk how it works but i am just gonna throw it out. Thank goodness it was a free sample set. I heard so much good stuff about this brand and it was a huge let down.
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,Canada,"Poor quality pump, prone to failure","Nice enough product but the pump is cheap and prone to failure.  I have had two pumps completely fail on bottles that were 2/3 to 3/4 full.  They were not dropped or mishandled in any way.  Caudalie would not provide a replacement and just offered me a few samples for my ""disappointment"".  You bet I'm disappointed to pay this much money only to have the pump fail.  I won't be disappointed a third time."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Gold Standard,Everything about this cream is perfect. It’s just rich enough to feel like it is nourishing skin but not so rich that it feels greasy. Absolutely worth the price and a little goes a long way.
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Luxury,"I got this through Sephora rewards, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to afford it. It's such a beautiful moisturizer, and smells so elegant (but it's natural and clean!). If you're thinking about getting this, do yourself a favor and do it!"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,Canada,NOT RE-BUYING AGAIN...,"Definitely not my favourite product.  First off, the heavy perfume smell is not only nauseating but totally not necessary for a good moisturizer, as it causes inflammation as well as other skin issues.  I did not love the texture, found it sat on top of skin, and really no benefits at all.  I expected more from this products and was disappointed."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,"I’ve been using this cream on and off for years and always come back to it. It’s one of the few face creams I’ve ever tried that really delivers results and doesn’t break me out! Everyone’s skin is of course different, but this makes my skin glow and really minimizes fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a very noticeable difference. I adore the cru oil from this line too and the two work beautifully together. I actually love the scent of this product and all of the products from the cru line have the same scent (FYI). I feel like the smell dissipates quickly though."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Worth the price - I always come back,"Absolutely love this cream! Hydrating but also anti-aging. After exploring other products/anti-aging creams, I I find myself always coming back to this product - simply because it works. I have combination skin, and typically only this at night, some nights with a retinoid - other times not. If it is during the winter/dryer months - I am able to use during the AM and just follow up with an spf. Even on its own- you will see a difference. If I want to supercharge it- I will use the premier cru oil as well."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,"This is a great universal moisturizer with a lovely scent, not greasy but definitely hydrates my skin (cream format).  I’ve purchased twice and the pump is crummy but the product itself is good.  Love that it’s a pump instead of a jar but wish they would improve the quality of the pump."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,Canada,NOPE,"This is the worst moisturizer I have ever used. Big claim, no word of a lie. My skin generally loves most things I put on it but it hated this. When applying this into the skin it balls up on itself and flakes off - it also doesn’t feel like my skin is drinking this in but rather it just sits on my face.  This also gave me perioral dermatitis. I know it was this product because this was the only new thing I introduced into my routine. Do not recommend."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,"This wasn’t anything special.  Didn’t notice any difference really, the smell is kinda strong, and I would say it makes my skin feel a bit clammy rather than absorbing as you would want it to.  Also don’t love the bottle, as it tends to clog very easily."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,Canada,Significant difference!,I got the premier cru trio as part of the promotion. I was dealing with puffy face and fine and sort of deep lines around my eyes and around my mouth. I started using the serum and cream. I noticed a significant difference in 2 weeks. My 11 between my eyebrows has disappeared. Really impressed. I just wished that it didn’t come with a huge price tag or it came in a set! Love it though
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,Canada,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,Definitely was super moisturizing and seemed to make my skin more smooth but I didn't like the smell. It was too flowery.
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,"This is a really good moisturizer and perfect for use along with the other products in the premier cru line. However, it’s also the most replaceable product in the line. I’ve cycled through a few other moisturizers after running out of my first bottle and didn’t notice any differences in my skin. In the end I did come back to this though, just because I would like to use a single product line for full effects."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,Australia,Ms,"Sephora, you have sent me an empty cream container so I can’t review it!! Pretty worried about ordering from you in future. Still waiting for you to sort this out... "
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Life-changing moisturizer,"This product is life-changing. I take my skincare routine very seriously and have tried a wide spectrum of products at all price ranges and from different brands. Most of them are alright, does the job and keeps my face happy - no complaint. This one, however, really took it to the next level. In addition to keeping my face moisturized, it significantly smoothed my skin tone and reduced my fine lines. It has more of a thick texture, and a little goes a long way. The only thing I didn't appreciate is its smell, but after a while it doesn't bother me anymore and again this is a subjective preference. Having said all that, it does hurt my bank account a lot, so I use it really sparingly... It is definitely worth the price though!"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,,Ms,Love premiere cru so light and never greasy but keeps the skin feeling soft. I am loathe to ever run out ! Love that I know I can always get it at Sephora!
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,"This is by far the worst lotion I have ever used. Made my skin dry, flaky and scaled. Could not believe I paid $140 for this junk!!!! Never had worse skin than when I used this."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Need to revamp packaging,"Love the product, hate the packaging. Hard to get all of the product out of the bottle."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,"It's a ridiculous price, but also the only cream that doesn't cause my skin to break out. So, I am looking forward to making this my winter cream. 
* I received this as a sample from Caudalie."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE!!!!!,"Okay this is literally a life changer. Let me start off by saying i’m only 22 but sagging skin and wrinkles run DEEP in my family. I started using this and bringing it down my neck underneath my makeup for about two months now. HOLY MOTHER OF GRAPES! I have a sharper jawline, NO DOUBLE CHIN, and more hydrated skin! Everyone keeps asking me what primer i’ve been using but it’s this moisturizer! I would take this with me to the grave. And that’s saying something considering I work for Sephora."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,"I absolutely loved the old formula.  It was moisturizing and rolled back the clock.  I didn’t notice the new change in the description on the label immediately, but kept wondering what was wrong with the product as it was not moisturizing as  it had been in the past. Then I saw an old order of mine and noticed the product number was different.  It was a highly rated product, so I don’t understand the change.  “If it ain’t broke...”.   So disappointed, and I will be looking for something else."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Best cream ever!,"I'm obsessed with this moisturizer!  It's so lightweight and not greasy at all. I love the feeling (and scent!) of putting it on before bed and feeling like my skin can breathe overnight while being hydrated, nourished and brightened. I also use this every morning under my makeup and gives my skin a velvety texture all day long. Love this and couldn't recommend more!"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,,marc,just started using this. quite a lux cream for its price. i still have to wait sometime to see its effects. but over all loving the texture. i put this cream in my ref. 😉 i love how i apply it a bit cool and absorbed by my skin. 
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Soooo nice,A little goes a long way and I’ve deffinetly noticed a difference in the texture of my skin! If you can afford it get it!
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,The best face cream I've ever had,"I've been using the Premier Cru Cream for the past couple of months daily. There is a reason Caudalie calls it the cream of all creams: it brightens, smoothens, nourishes and tightens my skin in one step! It sounded incredible that one product is capable of so much and given that the studies proved the effectiveness of the product, I was super excited to try it and now I can confirm myself that the product is amazing! 

I also really value how much care Caudalie puts in selecting ingredients for the products and that Caudalie products are not tested on animals and do not contain animal ingredients. 

I will definitely try more products from Caudalie!"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,"So far, after two weeks, this product gets five stars! Easy to use and silk smooth delivery make it an every day must do. Seeing and feeling results already. I love it."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Perfect year round face cream!,Far and away the best skincare line I have ever used. This cream is amazing - soaks into my skin and is completely non greasy. My skin is on the dry side and this cream works all year round. Only issue is my hubby borrowed on a recent trip and now he wants to use it too! Highly recommend!
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,"Absolutely amazing day cream! I love the smell, and makes your skin look perfect! Would highly recommend and totally worth the cost"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,"I don’t often write product reviews, but this product deserves some bragging. I have oily skin and look for moisturizers that hydrate my skin without greasing it and this is it. Although I am 24 and don’t have to necessarily worry about wrinkles, it is never to early to start using anti-aging and this is a perfect one to start with."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Lightweight and moisturizing,I’ve been using this product for a few days now and I have to say it has been working really well! It’s moisturizing but lightweight and it feels great on my skin. Would definitely recommend.
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Awesome,"This Cream is awesome for my normal to dry skin, After using it for a week  my face is smooth.  I'm seriously considering making this part of my daily moisturizer. V nice Creme."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,I have recently been exposed to products from Caudalie and I am loving this cream. I use it twice a day and it does not make me feel greasy or too dry. I am loving this cream. The long term anti aging effects are to be determined but I love the texture and the short term effects it has on my face!
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Hydration at its best,Love love love this product. The best thing ever to keep my skin hydrated during winter and not dry it out. Skin feels so supple and fresh after using it.
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Definitely recommended,This is the first product I tried from the Cru line and loved it. I've just been using it for a while and can already see a difference in skin texture and dark spots. Totally recommended!
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,"I have a little trouble with dry skin and I've been hearing about hyaluronic acid for a while now. When my dermatologist suggested I use it in conjunction with some of my prescriptions, and this product makes my skin feel so soft! No more flaky dry patches!"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,"I've been using the cream daily for over a week now. The first thing that struck me is the delicious and fresh fragrance the cream carries. I'm not kidding, I was tempted to taste it. It starts my day off right and puts me in a good mood. The cream is super light weight and gets absorbed easily. However, since my skin is on the dryer side I wished that the hydrated, dewy feeling lasted longer. I found myself needing to reapply it a few times during the day. Instead when I used the Caudalie divine oil, it left my skin smiling and soft all day. I am in love! As the name suggests its truly divine. The cream alone might not be sufficient if you have dry skin like me but for those looking for a clean, light moisturizer, this is the one."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,The anti-aging cream that feels like a feather!,"The anti-aging cream that feels like a feather and doesn't feel like a chemical! I've been looking for a good anti-aging cream but after hearing about the celeb favorites being too ""chemically strong"", I have been anxious about using them eveyrday. Alas, I have found my skin savior! I have eczema and sensitive skin and this did wonders for it since I started using it 3 nights ago! I was suffering from some dry skin patches from traveling and change in seasons and now its back to normal. It's a perfect match for combination skin where it doesn't make it too oily or dry!"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Best product ever !!!,"I have very sensitive skin I have been using this cream for 3 weeks now my skin looks beautiful and radiant , although it's expensive it's worth every penny I am obsessed.. I have used many products throughout the years this is the best so far .. Love it"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,GENTLE BUT POWERFUL,"I’m a devoted Caudalie fan, having used their products for 18 months and seeing at least 5 years younger-looking skin. It does everything you’d want an expensive, clean moisturizer to do. There is indeed magic in resveratrol! I try other products but my skin always knows and does not thank me!
It’s also the best-smelling moisturizer I’ve ever used. It is not perfumey or heavy, just a mild, beautiful scent that always makes me happy.
If there’s anything better on the market, I’d be shocked. Caudalie Premier Cru beats the pants off La Mer, Tatcha, Drunk Elephant, Kate Somerville, all the pricey moisturizers I’ve tried and broken up with. My younger, under-50-looking face is daily proof that I’m doing something fantastic for my 55-year-old skin."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Recommend it!,"Absolutely love this cream. It's lightweight, absorbs quickly, you can use for day and night, great for travelling"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,LOVE LOVE LOVE,I've been using Caudalie's Premier Cru Anti-Aging Cream for a few years now and love it! I ran out for a few weeks and could tell the difference! It's the best all-in-one clean cream for anti-aging.
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Leaves skin silky smooth,I received this cream as a gift and so glad I did. I really enjoy how silky smooth it leaves my skin. I literally soak it right up.
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Amazing Anti-Aging Cream!,"This cream is truly phenomenal! One of my skin concerns now that I'm in my mid 30's is to address the early signs of aging. Not only does this cream help to smooth the fine lines I've developed along my forehead and laugh lines, it is deeply nourishing and makes my skin look more youthful and radiant.  It's also housed in a container with a pump which I think helps to maintain the integrity of the formula. (as opposed to having to dip my fingers like most cream products) It has worked wonders on my skin and I will be definitely picking this up during the next Sephora VIB Sale."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,it works everyone!!,"As you all know how much I love Caudalie products! Each of their formula is natural, effective, and free of synthetic and harmful ingredients (and cruelty free)! The Premier Cru cream supposed to brighten, visibly tighten, plump, smooth, and nourish skin! I apply it morning and night (a dime sized amount) on my palms and apply gently by patting my face and neck. I haven't seen much results yet as I've been using it only for a week, but I know from using other Caudalie products that THIS WILL WORK as they claim! I highly recommend!"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Elegant anti-aging multi-tasker,"This cream is one of the most elegant and pleasant in use anti-aging products I ever used. It’s lightweight but comforting, moisturizing, nourishing and protecting from environmental damages. I use it all over face, neck and even under my eyes and love to see how smooth and plump my skin looks after the application."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,"This is one of my favorite creams. It's rich and creamy, and feels like it absorbs and really moisturizes my skin, but at the same time doesn't feel sticky or heavy. In my 30s, I feel like I need some anti-aging, but don't like the really greasy feel some creams have. This one is the perfect balance. I also love the scent which smells like a sweet floral honey to me!"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,"This cream has such a wonder scent and texture. The scent is refreshing , and it absorbs so quickly. It definitely a great hydration product. My skin is soft and supple after using it. I use this every night , and my skin loves it. As far as anti aging, I don't have wrinkles . Bit definitely liking it ."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,Canada,Definitely my new fave!,"It's insanely hydrating even though it feels like a much lighter cream. Matte finish which is not my personal favorite but works well under makeup.  I might need serum in the winter but for summer, this combination gives me enough hydration for my normal to dry skin."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,amazing!,I love this product and how versatile it is! Even my mom loves it!
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,"I loved the older version and worried that this new one may not be as good. I was wrong. This new premier cru cream is perfect in many ways. It softens my skin, smooth out and brighten up my complexion within the first couple of uses. I use this with my Fresh black tea essence. I may need serum in the winter but for summer, this combination gives me enough hydration and anti-aging benefits for my normal to dry skin. It doesn’t break me up and it make my pores look smaller. I only wish it is less expensive."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,,Customer O,"Love the caudalie premier cru cream. Before i discover this product, i am using the drunk elephant skin care products. They were also good but i wanted a skincare that is not time consuming to apply. this is so perfect for a working mom who are always in a hurry. "
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,disappointed... fragrance?? $140?,Amazing ingredients.. however I threw away due to fragrance... only a sample. Unlike the eye cream. This I will not put on my face. Major disappointment... why the fragrance??
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,it didn’t clog my pores!,My skin has terrible congested pores. I thought I needed gel moisturizers but they’ve become too light for me in winter. Im so glad I discovered this!! It doesn’t leave that sticky feeling and it didn’t clog my pores!!!
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,,Mrs,"Rich and smooth. The skin absorbs it straight away. 
It might be on the expensive side, but it’s worth it!!
All products from Caudalie I’ve used so far are fantastic quality-wise.
"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,"I used 2-3 pumps and still found my face tight after using this cream. I love the smell - very luxurious - but I didn’t feel or see any of the benefits after a week of use. In fact, my skin started to feel quite raw and develop dry patches. Disappointing for such a high price tag."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,,Highly Recommend ,Using this with the serum has given me a glowing complexion. It’s definitely helped reduce the oilyness of my skin and has cleared a few blemishes. Would definitely recommend it if you’re looking for something that brightens the skin 
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,I love this line from Caudalie. This cream is lightweight and moisturizes well and doesn’t make me break out or feel greasy. I use small mount in the morning since it gets so humid where i live and  use at night whenever i need (I believe that i have combination skin) Dry skin will be fine to use during the day in summer. I’m enjoying this cream so far!
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,The Best There Is...But Very Expensive,"This is Extremely expensive, about $70 cheaper in Europe...but it is the best by far...and you don't need to buy any other serums. This works great for men too. I always get compliments on my skin... Which I never thought would happen. I've tried just about every moisturizer in Sephora...This won handful down."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Broke for Moisture,"I've been using this for a few years (much to the dismay of my bank account). It's insane to pay this price for a moisturizer; but I find it's the only thing that actually works on my Canadian punished winter skin. A little goes a long way, and I always pull apart the bottle and cut open the bag inside to get it all at the end. All I can say is stock up during insider events. 
Haven't been able to find anything comparable yet..even better than Le Mer, on my skin."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,The price is outrageous but it’s so nice! A little goes along way so perhaps the price is not as bad as it seems. It’s so moisturizing and it’s nice and thick without feeling heavy and think. It feels super light on the skin.
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Must have product,"Oh, my, do I love this stuff!  Purchased it after being highly impressed by a free sample. Even my husband noticed how much nicer my skin looked. This is a very impressive moisturizer. Caudalie products don’t fail me. I have been through many moisturizers that leave my combo skin gloppy and do nothing to improve the health of my skin. I’ve got very resistant skin (opposites of sensitive) and it takes a truly great product to penetrate through to make a difference. With Caudalie it glows, pores are less clogged, is more even. If you haven’t tried this, you should!"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Disappointed,"I used to love this cream before the now new formula. The consistency totally changed, now it’s more mate less radiant my pores look more visible and my foundation looks more caked. I used to get lots of compliments before. I don’t understand why they have to change the formulas."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,"Hands down the best moisturizer I ever used !!
I was in search of a good moisturizer for a very long time but finally the wait is over. I’ve a very very sensitive skin and I tend to easily breakout but this moisturizer doesn’t give me any break outs and also when using this cream in the night you wake up to a bright and plump skin."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Amazing,"I didn’t want to love this as much as I do because of the price, but it is worth it. A little goes a long way, and it has helped my skin this winter so much. I have also noticed the lines on my forehead (that I have had since high school) are actually less deep and less noticeable. Hands down the best moisturize I have used"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Deep anti-aging moisture with no grease,"I was first introduced to Caudalie products after using my points for a free facial at their spa. This was one of the products used. I have combination skin with tendency to fine breakouts easily with anything too greasy. 
I am 45 so I am always look for anti-aging creams my skin can tolerate and this is one I love. Super light on the skin -absorbs quickly 
I use it with premier cru oil and serum. I was amazed I could layer a cream and an oil and my skin was happy. The routine leaves my skin immaculate - smooth skin tight pores no breakouts fine lines around my eyes nose lips mild improvement bouncy especially in the morning I can see the effect clearly
Yes this line is crazy expensive but after one month of use I highly recommend if you want nice anti-aging that’s good for combination acne prone skin"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Love this product,Love this product.  My skin is soft and it gives a brighter look to the skin.
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Like but not Love,"When I first tried this in store I loved it.  The store assistant gave me a sample, and I continued to love it.  Then I bough the full size product and the love dwindled.   It seemed to be pasty and thick, leaving residue on my eyes that dried and flaked.   Then, the product dried in the pump shooting out a hard substance each time I used it.  I'm not going to purchase again."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,pills,I loved the smell and initial texture of this over the cru serum but it pilled like crazy! I was so disappointed.
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Not a good moisturizer.,I do not like this product at all. My skin is so dry when I use it and the smell is sort of medicinal. I usually love everything from Caudalie but I would not buy this again.
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,OBSESSED!!!,"This whole Cru line Caudalie is exactly what I have been needing for so long! I use it every day now and I can honestly without a doubt say my skin is in love with it! The fine lines, dark spots and overall uneven skin tone is a thing of the past! Thank you Caudalie!!!!!!"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,One and done cream!!!!,"I started using the serum from this line over 2 months ago and LOVED it so much, 
I decided to try the cream next. I had read on the website that the cream and serum are more effective together and wow - totally right! It's such a light weight but super nourishing moisturizer. It's a matte finish which is my personal favourite but works even on my drier days. STUNNING under makeup and literally gives an Instagram filter look to my skin and blurs out imperfections! OBSESSED!!!"
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,I can't do without this in my facial regimen!,"I love this line from Caudalie. I was hesitant to make this purchase at first due to the cost, but I don't regret it. I originally got a sample of this cream in a caudalie set, and I was hooked ever since.

I have combination skin, with a lot of dry patches, plus a lot of blemishes. I noticed a huge difference in my complexion and softness of skin after using this in conjunction with other Caudalie products. I even ran out of this product at one point and I thought I could do without it as I was still using the other caudalie moisturizers, toner and serum, but right away my skin began taking on that dull uneven tones like before I used it. So of course I had to repurchase, and things are feeling and looking good once again. I think this product works wonders."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Amazing Results!,"I thought this Cream was going to be to thick for my oily skin, but wow! After a weeks use, my face is SO smooth! And for the first time, when I wake up, my skin isn't back to being oily. It feels...Normal, which is very nice! 
The price is high on this Cream though, which is a shame. But I'm seriously considering making this part of my daily skincare routine. It's the only Moisturizer I've honestly found that works."
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,My skin feels unbelievably soft using Cru products!
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Caudalie Premier Cru Cream,Where has premier cru been all my life? Amazing. And great ratings on EWG.
CAUDALIE-Premier Cru Cream,USA,Amazing,"This cream is truly amazing! Complexion is flawless and my skin is firm, this is the line combines all into one, and delivers in results..... it's expensive but so worth the money...."
BURT'S BEES-Skin Nourishment Night Cream,Singapore,I like the smell,"I like the smell of it, smells quite nice and floral, like most burt bees product. But the texture is a bit thick, difficult to spread and absorb into skin. Sits on top on skin, forming a thick film."
BURT'S BEES-Skin Nourishment Night Cream,Singapore,ok product,Maybe this does not have much effect on me. I have to apply a lot to feel my skin moisturised. It does absorb fast into the skin but my pores look big and don’t see much improvement. 
BURT'S BEES-Skin Nourishment Night Cream,Malaysia,Good for oily skin,"Not too oily but managed to moisturise the skin well. Really good for oily skin like mine, doesn’t leave my face too oily. Skin looks brighter and less dry after using it. "
BURT'S BEES-Skin Nourishment Night Cream,Singapore,Moisturizer,ugh this product  broke me out!! it has a great scent to it and has good moisturising properties but every time i used it i’d wake up with pimples the next day.  
BURT'S BEES-Skin Nourishment Night Cream,Malaysia,love it,I love this. Suitable for my dry skin. Makes skin plump and i look glowing when using this. My skin feels dewy. I will repeat this item. First time trying using burts and bees product. Great
BURT'S BEES-Skin Nourishment Night Cream,,non oily ,This night cream is non oily and does not feel sticky after application. Skin feels soft and smooth after washing off. Recommended for repurchase! The smell is not overpowering and smells pretty neutral. 
BURT'S BEES-Skin Nourishment Night Cream,,very nourishing,"Great for skin in need of hydration and plumping. you see the results within a month and I feel my complexion also brightens up, at least, that is the comment I get "
