It combines a range of soothing and healing ingredients to bring immediate relief and comfort to dry and irritated skins. It is great for those with broken capillaries, diffused redness, skin sensitivities and inflammation. It is also suitable to help calm rosacea, eczema and dermatitis-prone skins. Water is essential for cellular life, so a well-moisturised skin with properly functioning cells is both healthy and younger-looking. If the skin has been damaged or irritated, leaving its lipid barrier impaired, it cannot begin to heal until such time as the lipid barrier is repaired and moisture loss is stopped. Essential Hydration Cream can help to heal and return balance to the skin’s lipid barrier by nourishing and protecting dry and delicate skins. Arnica, Cypress, Malt and Solomon’s Seal combine in a powerful anti-redness complex which provides anti-inflammatory properties, whilst also strengthening the walls of the capillaries to diffuse redness in the skin.
