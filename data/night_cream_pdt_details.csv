C + E Protect and Repair Moisturizer infuses five per cent advanced, oxygen-stable tetrahexydecyl ascorbate (THD ascorbate) into the skin—the gold standard form of vitamin C.

With 5 per cent THD ascorbate, this moisturizer is powerful at fighting the first visible signs of ageing and restoring vital skin radiance, while being uniquely suitable for those with sensitive skin, as THD ascorbate is significantly less irritating than other forms of vitamin C. Once in the skin, it helps boost youthful-looking skin texture and volume, in addition to providing photostable, antioxidant support. Blended with protective, anti-pollution expopolysaccharides and refining lime pearl extract, this formula visibly repairs the effects of ageing, environmental stress, and pollution-induced damage. It is rich yet never greasy, providing hydration and antioxidant protection to the skin for a visibly younger, softer, and healthier-looking complexion.","AHAs, Anti-oxidants, Fragrance-free, Paraben-free, Sulphate-free, Vitamins","Water, Squalane, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, C10-18 Triglycerides, Peg-8 Beeswax, Polyglyceryl-6 Distearate, Tapioca Starch, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Citric Acid, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Glycerin, Citrus Tangerina Peel Oil, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Bisabolol, Jojoba Esters, Tocopherol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Limonene, Phenoxyethanol, Lecithin, Nylon-12, Rosa Centifolia Flower Wax, Rosa Damascena Flower Wax, Sodium Phytate, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Chlorphenesin, Citrus Australasica Fruit Extract, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Citrus Junos Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa Root Extract, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lippia Citriodora Flower Extract, Oenothera Biennis Seed Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Alteromonas Ferment Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Dehydroacetic Acid.",https://image-optimizer-reg.production.sephora-asia.net/images/product_images/closeup_1_Product_817494012996-Sunday-Riley-CEO-Vitamin-C-Rich-Hydration-Cream-50g_ce936f34dfa936ad1da5538d5a6e7e0ed9e7b564_1581582852.png
