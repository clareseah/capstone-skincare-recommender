FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,enjoyed ,I very much liked this face cleanser! It felt lovely on the skin and definitely did the job of giving it a refreshing clean. Although I have now moved on to try a milk based cleanser as I seem to have very dry skin. If my current one doesn’t do the job I will definitely be repurchasing this one.

FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,average ,I bought this based on the reviews. I don’t find that it cleanses thoroughly and the tube dispensed too much at a time. I’m glad I tried it but I won’t be repurchasing.

FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,Best cleanser!,"Definitely one of the gentlest cleanser I’ve used in my life. Been trying to stop and used other brand, but the impact is not the same as this one. My skin getting soft and I’m buying the biggest pack which can last quite long (around 3 + months). Best investment for my skin ❤️"

FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,The best cleanser for dry/ aging skin,"The first time I used this, I could see a difference in my skin tone.

FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,Love it,"As far as I have been using this product, I have no complaints. It does what it is supposed to do and rinses off pretty well. Although it is on the pricey side, I still love most of Fresh products. "
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,good basic cleanser ,"Good all rounder if you need just a basic cleanser for your skincare routine. I love that it’s very gentle and doesn’t make me feel like my skin is tight. Only con for me is the price, but other than that is all good ✔️"
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,i guess i’m a soy girl now,"i've been trying a couple of cleansers and i  always come back to this. it's simple, easy, fluff and fuss free. i feel clean, it didn't broke me out and the smell isn't offensive. honestly what more can i ask for in a cleanser? i doubt i'll try anything else. i’m basic"
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,This is amazing!!! ,I have sensitive oily combination skin and I am loving how this cleanser is making my skin feel. I initially got it as a sample and then purchased as soon as I saw how much my skin was loving this product! I have noticed my skin becoming more hydrated and supple. It also washes off makeup quite well especially when you have heavy makeup on.

FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,love it,This cleanser is so gentle on the skin yet powerful enough to remove my makeup. it doesn't irritate the eyes and smells fresh. You only need a little bit so it fits a long way. 
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,USA,Worse cleanser,"Worse cleanser, I don’t use too much makeup just mascar and concealer and didn’t take any of my concealer off, this cleanser make my face feel dirty after the first use, if you want something good, youth to the people has the best cleanse"
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,love it,"Buy it for my teenage daughter. The salesperson recommend this product because she said it perfect for young skin and plus my daughter have a lot of breakout. Now, after the trying the first small tube, her skin definitely improve and glows.. will continue to use it.. just that the price is quite high.. well have to buy it when it on sale then.."
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Canada,Love it!,"I love this cleanser, it has a lovely smell (very subtle) and my face feels very clean afterwards. It's also great at removing mascara and you just need a small amount. I purchased it many times!"
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,most gentle cleanser,"The most gentle cleanser I ever had. It keeps my skin soft and hydrated. It’s a bit expensive, so I mostly use it when my skin is irritated or need to relax. Removes eye makeup easily however double cleansing is needed for face."
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,ms,"a nice cleanser that feels quite luxurious and smells amazing, that also does the job, however it is a little expensive, there are better alternatives out there, won’t be repurchasing "
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,The best for sensitive skin,"The best cleanser for sensitive skin. I have very dry sensitive skin, but it also gets clogged with the amount of moisturiser I need to use. This cleanser cleanses so well but doesn't dry me out or irritate my skin."
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,The best for sensitive skin,"The best cleanser for sensitive skin. I have very dry sensitive skin, but it also gets clogged with the amount of moisturiser I need to use. This cleanser cleanses so well but doesn't dry me out or irritate my skin."
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,Works beyond my expectation,"As far as i love natural & organic products, Fresh Soy cleanser works beyond my expectation especially when it can deeply cleans & removes makeup. No second thoughts of paying 180 bucks for a 2 in 1 cleanser. best part is my boyf got influenced and currently be his fav cleanser! sis proud <3"
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Canada,Made my skin red after use,"I didn't like this product, but I know a lot of people like this product so it might just not have agreed with my skin. I have acne-prone skin, which is currently dehydrated (oily T-zone but otherwise normal). After using this, my skin was RED, which I find unusual because most cleansers don't do that to me. I thought this was a gentle cleanser too, which is why I tried it. I prefer the Inkey List's fulvic acid cleanser (doesn't irritate my skin)."
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,Always come back to this,"I have used this for almost 10 years. I was on holidays in the States and wanted to try a new skin care range and came across Fresh. When I came back and before Sephora came to Australia, I managed to stock up on the Fresh range from family and friends who travelled there and were nice enough to bring me back what I needed. The Soy Cleanser is very gentle and doesn't make your skin dry. As I've gotten older, I've tried other  skin care range (as I want something anti-aging) but I seem to come back to Fresh. With the Soy Cleanser, it doesn't strip off everything on your skin that leaves that tight, dry feeling. It's not cheap nor is it expensive either. It doesn't foam up fully but when you lather it a bit and wash your face, I find it amazing. I find it's true what people say, it does last awhile as a little goes a long way. "
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,absolute favourite cleanser,"Best cleanser I've tried, it gets all of my makeup off including heavy eye makeup. It is eye sensitive, minimal perfume/scent. Have repurchased multiple times"
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Singapore,Fresh Soy face Cleanser,"Fresh Soy face Cleanser. I heard so many reviews about this cleanser, So i decided to give it a try, and i didn’t disappoint me and makes my skin feel super clean and smooth after washing. Recommend."
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,Must have,"I started with the smalled tube but then brought the full bottle. It is perfect on my acne prone, oily skin. Really helps balance it out. I use it nightly. Not the best for removing eye makeup, start with removing makeup with another product but followup with this for a really clean skin. This helped reduce my acne. "
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,Not so impressive ,"This product was fine in the beginning, got some differences, but after some time I didn’t see any difference anymore, not really a wow product, its give little dryness for my skin, overall not so well worked on me."
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Singapore,my always go to cleanser!,It is fresh on my skin (as the brand says..) and removes light makeup. it doesn't dry up the skin nor leaves any uncomfortable feeling after cleansing.
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,Fav! ,"Love how gentle and refreshing this cleanser is! Does the job in removing light makeup and the refreshing cucumber scent is a plus point.

FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,best cleanser I’ve ever used ,"It’s such a gentle cleanser for my sensitive skin. I’ve never had such a clear hydrated skin with other cleansers before. It melts all of your makeup away, I usually do it twice just to make sure the makeup is off and then use the kombucha cleansing treatment to make sure everything is off and then use my normal routine. It’s so good and smells amazing I’m in love. I ended up getting the giant bottle because I use this every single day!"
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Canada,Wouldn’t recommend !,I’ve used many cleansers and by far this is the lowest one on my list. I’m a combination of oily and dry skin but more on dry side but this cleanser made my skin super dry and was not able to take the basic makeup off. I still have tatcha and khiels on the top of my list.
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Singapore,Simple and easy to use,"Sinple and easy-to-use cleanser. The gel consistency makes it fuss-free, and it cleanses thoroughly without making the skin feels too dry and stripped of moisture."
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,Great cleanser ,This is my third one already. I have tried many other cleansers and this is definitely the best. Light gel texture and smells great. Skin feels nice and clean after using 
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,Savior for dry skin ,"I’ve struggled for years to find my holy grail cleanser and this is it! I have dry skin and everything use to strip my skin. This leaves me feeling hydrated, plump and smells like a spa treatment. Couldn’t recommend more"
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,USA,A must-have!,"This is an amazing product. I have oily and acne probe skin and this has been a great addition to my skin care routine. I used to think that using harsh cleansers were the best, but that's a lie. A gentle cleaner like this is amazing for my skin. It doesn't leave my skin dry and it cleans very well. I love it and I will keep buying. The smell is great as well."
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,Good,This is a pretty good cleanser. It’s not overly drying but if I use it every day it can leave my skin feeling slightly tight. It’s got a light cucumber scent. It leaves your skin feeling nice and clean. 
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,Smooth like smoothie,This cleanser makes my skin so smooth and clean after using it. Very gentle on the face and does not break me out despite of the sweet scent from the cleanser (i have sensitive skin). But sadly it makes my eyes dry soooo bad that i had to stop using it. 
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Singapore,Weird smell and dries my skin,Giving this a 3-stars because it has a weird smell and dries my skin. Everyone seems to be giving it 5-stars. But this product is not so suitable for me. The gel texture on the other hand is nice though. I’ll try to see if I can return the product for a full refund. Luckily I bought the 50ml size. 
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Canada,FRESH Soy Face Cleanser - 150ml,Absolutely love! My all time favourite cleanser. Very gentle and no harsh fragrances. Does not leave your skin feeling tight.
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,Returned item,"Didnt try it, returned it, dont remember why, I think it was due to it being scented. Utube Influencers say not to use scented stuff on your face as it causes sensitivity in the future. This still showed in my account as pending a review so here it is."
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Singapore,my all time favourite cleanser ,"This cleanser is perfect. It doesn’t irritate my eyes, removes makeup, smells good and the texture is so easy to use. Doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry after either. I have repurchased this umpteen times."
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,Gentle on the skin,This is an amazing cleanser if you're looking for one that is gentle on the skin. The is a very mild scent to it (which I love) and it cleans without stripping off the oils on the skin. Would highly recommend getting it during the Sale. 
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Canada,Smells like pickles but works well,"I've been using this product for the past couple of weeks, and I believe its really helped my skin look super healthy and glowy and I love how it makes my skin look and feel- however, the only downside is as soon as I started using it I noticed it smelled like pickles which was super weird- it doesn't leave my skin smelling like pickles, and it works really well on my skin (I have combination skin and get the occasional breakout fiesta), so I'm definitely going to keep using it- however if you are sensitive to smell I wouldn't recommend this product."
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Singapore,gentle and effective,"Heard so many reviews about this so decided to finally give it a try, and it didn’t disappoint! Love how gentle it is on my skin and makes my skin feel super clean after washing. "
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Singapore,Soy Face Cleanser,"Yup!! like everyone elses recommendations, this cleanser is one of a kind. you can tell the gentleness of this product as you apply it. 😀 will continue using this cleanser 👍🏼"
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,great everyday cleanser,I love this as a gentle everyday cleanser. I haven't tried it to remove makeup (i usually use micellar water as my first step to remove makeup) but it certainly makes my face feel clean and refreshed after. Great product and not too hard on the pocket either. Good value for your buck 
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Singapore,FRESH Soy Face Cleanser,Got this for free in the birthday pack. It cleanses the face rather well. Just need a little of it. Overall is good experience but don't really think it's special enough for me to pay this amount for it as I've already had my favourite cleansers.
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,USA,Cleared up my College Breakouts!,"College can be stressful, and it causes random acne breakouts here and there! But ever since I have been using this face wash, I’ve experienced minimal break outs and have had soft and glowing skin!
This is literally a life saver!"

FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Singapore,"Re purchase, love the product","My second time buying this. 

Love the way it cleans my skin, and feel so soft after wash. The smell is very gentle. The size is good for travel. Also a great choice for gift."
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,super gentle,"I have very dry sensitive skin with eczema. I have been using this face wash for the past 2 years. Super gentle, even with flare ups and removing eye makeup "
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Singapore,Gentle,Great gentle cleanser for double clensing at night. Doesn't leave my skin feeling tight and is gentle around the eyes. Fragrance is abit stong so it could be off putting for some
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,loveee this ,"i used to stop wearing this one since i felt like it didnt do much to my skin, but i started to use this one again, and i fall in love with it againnnn "
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,Miss,"As always, fresh product really suit my skin. Im shocked how soft my skin after using this cleanser. My holy grail cleanser. A bit expensive for me. 😅😅😅"
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,favourite cleanser ,I've tried different cleansers but I always go back to this eventually. I like that the scent is light and how it removes my makeup effectively so I don't have to use much makeup remover. Props to the sephora employee who recommended this cleanser many years ago!
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,Pleasant Smell,"I start with tester packet from Sephora, after 3 days using it my skin feel comfortable after cleansing routine, and its had cucumber scent too. I had enjoyed using this cleanser. Loved!"
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,nice cleanser,"very nice cleanser that can remove makeup, sunscreen together. A nice texture n smell make the skin feel refreshing n clean. Will keep buying again after i finish the current 1."
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Singapore,Nothing wrong except the price,"This is the third one I've used, and it's really gentle and easy to use.  The texture is watery and gel-like, and it is difficult to foam.  It was very clean after washing, although there was no foam in the texture, and there was no feeling of dryness and tightness after washing, but after wiping the lotion with a cotton pad it would be very clean.  A little fresh cucumber smell, which is also my favorite place."
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Singapore,3rd purchase! ,This is definitely my go to when I needed a facial wash / makeup remover. It very mild and at the same time make my skin feels fresh and clean. I have combination skin and sensitive skin. Will definitely recommend!

"
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Singapore,Great,this didnt really last me super long because i use it everyday. it is pricey and i will not recommend if u are on a budget but it is a really good facial cleanser. it cleans gently and removes makeup effectively
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,New Zealand,soy cleanser,I have really enjoyed this cleanser . it's very gentle and not drying which is just what I need. not amazing at taking make up off but that's typical with this style of cleanser 
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,Great cleanser,"This is a great cleanser that's gentle enough to be used morning and evening. It leaves skin feeling cleansed without drying. Not sure about it removing makeup as I usually double cleanse and use an oil based makeup remover before cleansing. But overall love this, will repurchase!"
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,Love this cleanser ,"I’ve been using this for about 18 months or so as my 2nd cleanse. I used multiple minis, finally bit the bullet and bought the full size. It lasts forever, as you really only need the tiniest amount, about half the size of a 5c piece for face and neck. It has a nice “slip” feel to it, meaning you don’t have to rub at your skin to get the first cleanse remnants off. My skin is oily, FYI. I do not find this cleanser drying at all. And there is a slight scent which I find pleasant and describe as fresh/cucumber/grassy. "
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,Buy it ,"Yeah this is honestly the best, I don't do skin care but I chuck this in the shower and use it daily on my face and it makes a difference. Actually worth the money "
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,not doing much,"Well, I’m not sure how i feel about this. It does nothing amazing for my skin other than just cleaning it. Not foamy, which i prefer. Scent is very mild. The first few time using, it dries out my skin, making it feels tight and stripped, but after a month, my skin kinda adapt with it. "
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Singapore,hyped!,"I wonder what is the hype for this face cleanser. I found it so average and nominal and don’t understand why it is priced so high. On top if that it gives a weird smell (like egg) when I rub it on my skin. Being a vegetarian always, i find it repealing. Highly recommend buying smaller size so that you find whether it suits you before buying the large one. I am just hoping that it runs out soon so that I can switch to another cleanser. "
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,Staple ,Loving this after trying on 2nd bottle. It doesn’t produce much bubble or milky effect. It’s doesn’t have strong scent . It’s clean well as 2nd facial cleanser . 
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Singapore,My all time favorite cleanser,"This is my all time favorite cleanser! I love it cause it's Very gentle, very mild. There's basically no soap, no bubbles forming. So it won't dry up your skin. The only down side of it is, it doesn't clean very thoroughly. I think it mentioned it can clean away make-up, but I tried and there's still makeup left on my skin. So I usually use this in the morning :)"
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Malaysia,Mrs,"Work on my skin, make my skin clean and smooth. Easy to use, worth buying. Highly recomended?"
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,USA,"OK cleanser,  bad strong smell","I'm 50/50 on this one. I think it works ok and it's gentle on my face which is nice. I don't like the smell at all though. I was expecting a subtle/natural smell, but it has a weird strong plastic smell? And although it does feel gentle, I don't feel like it's really working to get everything off my face. It just feels like it glides around my skin like a gel. Might finish the bottle but probably won't buy again..."
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Singapore,The best,Cleansers are not supposed to make your skin feel tight after washing.. And this did just that! Its very mild and I have been using it like forever.. from single to married and now with a child. Its not harsh but it cleanses the face well with just a bit. I have dry cheeks and oily t-zone 
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,USA,LOVE,Absolutely worth it in my opinion. Everything irritates my skin or causes breakouts except this and the CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser.
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,USA,FRESH Soy Face Cleanser - 150ml,Didn’t like the smell or texture didn’t notice any hydration
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,USA,Good cleanser,"It’s good cleanser,doesn’t trigger acne and doesn’t dry skin also after use.but due to price I would not give it 5 star!"
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,great for winter,This is a great face wash specially in the winter when I need an extra gentle cleanser. It’s not great removing mascara unless I pre remove it with a face balm. However it’s gentle with my skin and doesn’t leave it feeling tight and dry
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,love!,"I have to say, this is the perfect cleanser for me, it leaves my skin feeling clean but not “stripped”. I would definitely recommend this product! Particularly if you have sensitive skin!"
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,Australia,DR,Best cleanser for oily skin. Very gentle
FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,USA,Has been the best during pregnancy!,My skin has been horrible during my pregnancy (full-blown acne) and I have been using this face wash for the past week.

FRESH-Soy Face Cleanser,New Zealand,good ,it is such a nice smooth clear smell nice cleanser I just like the feeling of it. it would not remove make up so I use it as a second cleanse. I think that Fredh products are nice but extremely overpriced for what it is.  I bought small version of it
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Australia,Squalane Cleanser ,"I absolutely love this cleanser, it clears up acne and small bumps and is very soothing for the skin. Although it can take a while for the product to heat up since it’s an oil but otherwise it’s an amazing product! "
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Philippines,Great cleanser! ,"first use and I'm in love! this cleanser does not make my skin feel tight at all, not stripping, and my face glows after using it. I will still test if this can be part of my double cleanse routine at night, but after trying it I think this is great as a morning cleanser. "
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Australia,cleanser,Very thick but feels good on the skin.                             Does help remove make up and make you feel very refreshed.                                                                           
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Australia,amazing ,The ordinary cleanser is amazing I have already noticed improvement to my acne as well as my acne scarring I would definatly recommend and it is also affordable.
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Australia,Ms,My skin has never been better since using this cleanser- great for my oily skin! 
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 50ml,I use this product before a water-based cleanser to remove sunscreen and/or makeup. It does a good job of removing these products. It does leave my skin a little oily even after the water-based cleanser though.
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,New Zealand,love this ,"Love this cleanser , glides on make my face feel hydrated with a glow … not to expensive. I’m quite fussy with cleansers but I think I will continue to buy this one "
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 150ml,Not worth it. I always have to double cleanse when I use this product.
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Singapore,Ms ,This is one of the most easiest and fastest cleanser I have used to remove make up and dirt. It works really well on my skin and does not make it feel dry after washing. 
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Australia,Holy Grail first cleanser,"I've purchased The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser multiple times and it is my holy grail cleanser. No fragrance, great for sensitive skin and it turns into an oil once you work it in. Great for getting makeup off. I always recommend this cleanser and will continue to purchase. "
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Australia,surprisingly great!,"I really wasn't expecting to love this product, I thought it would be average but it's a fantastic ,great quality cleanser. Nice and rich and just melts make up right off. Feels luxurious but no scent. Highly recommend it!"
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 150ml,"This cleanser is so great, melts your makeup right off."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,Must have !,"I love this product, this makes me not lazy to remove my make up like before lol, I wear Estee lauder double wear, so it takes time to complete remove and after going out and being tired there's nothing faster than this, also did not make me break out since have sensitive skin."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Australia,cleanser ,"Hated the texture it turns into a strange oil but it’s not like other oil based ones I’ve tried! It weirdly doesn’t spread well at all being an oil type cleanser, doesn’t really clean your face at all, wouldn’t recommend and wouldn’t use it again."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Singapore,Squalene Cleanser,An effective oil based cleanser. Does help remove the makeup and dirt off the face. It is pretty light on the face when applying. Super easy to apply and remove and does leave the face feeling fresh and less greasy. 
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Australia,Best cleanser ,"For my mature rosacea suffering sensitive skin this is the best cleanser. It’s silky and smooth, it moves gently over my skin and then rinses easily off leaving my feeling clean and does not leave my skin stripped/dry."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Amazing oil cleanser!,I’ve really fallen in love with this cleanser! It removes all my make up no problem and rinses really easily. I also love the feeling of it becoming silkier as it warms up on my skin. Super gentle and it’s going to be great for my skin in the winter!
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,🤷‍♀️ wouldn't recommend for makeup wearers,"It didn't di much for me, while the silky texture feels great, I can get over the slight smell it has and I didn't feel it did much in terms of breaking down spf or excess sebum in my skin, I also felt that it left a weird layer on my skin. I tried it because it was affordable but definitely nit as effect as other pre cleans products."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,A must have in skincare,This has been my 3rd time purchasing this. I use it every night before I use a cleanser to remove all my makeup. I use it all over my eyes also and it does not irritate or burn. Will continue to buy this.
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Singapore,omg best oil cleanser,I bought this as an oil cleanser as the first cleanse for double cleansing. The best oil cleanser for the price I've used.
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,gets the job done for an affordable price,"I don't demand much from my cleansers. I just don't want them to make my face feel stripped and I want them to rinse off cleanly. I've been using this as my night cleanser, and this works great to get the day off without being stripping at all and without me feeling like I have to rinse a thousand times to be free of residue. Bonus: it plays nicely with my silicone electronic brush, and is easy to wash off of it. On the down side, I do feel like I need to use quite a bit of product as it doesn't seem to spread very well. I don't tend to wear much makeup, but when I do I have to double cleanse as this takes quite a bit of time to get rid of any makeup despite it saying ""makeup remover"" right on the bottle."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,You need this,"I can not recommend this product enough!!
This mask has helped my acne so much. 
I recommend this to everyone who struggles with acne. Love this product"
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,New Zealand,beautiful cleanser,amazing products so glad I made the switch my face isn't red or red spots. my face looks refreshed and cleans and glowing definitely will be repurchasing again 
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 150ml,I heard it’s best to take your makeup off with an oil based remover. And I found this cheap one and love it so much. You don’t need to much and your makeup melts right off
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Great Makeup Remover,"Great for removing makeup, but I'd recommend using a different cleanser to get that ""clean skin"" feeling."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Favourite oil cleanser!,After using this product for a few weeks I am in love! I use this as my first step in a double cleanse and my skin feels great. I have used so many cleansing balms and this one does the job for such a good price. My skin does not feel oily afterwards and it removes all of my makeup. I have already purchased a back up!
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 150ml,"The weirdest cleanser I’ve ever tried. The texture was unusual, but most notable was that it is the only cleanser I’ve ever used that made my vision cloudy! I used it twice, and it was so bothersome trying to clear my eyes up after washing my face that I threw it right in the trash."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 150ml,Was not my favourite of their products. It cleaned well enough just was hard on my eyes even after rinsing it off.
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,It’s ok,"It’s a decent basic cleanser, I don’t wear makeup so I can’t say how good of a makeup remover it is but I do have to use a lot of product to get my waterproof mineral spf off, even in the shower. Would probably be good for someone who wants a simple routine, but as someone who has acne I can’t see myself using this as my one and only cleanser. Definitely a first cleanse only for me."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,The best face wash!!,"I was struggling to find a good face wash for my dry, irritated skin. I tried so many different brands. Eventually I decided to try this cleanser, and oh my gosh! The Ordinary Squalene cleanser has helped my skin so much My skin is noticeably softer and the acne has cleared up so much. For such an affordable price, this is truly an AMAZING product. I 100% recommend. It will save you if your skin is anything like mine!!Cleanser has gel"
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Obsessed,I hated this at first it felt too gentle but glad I continued giving it a chance only face wash I use for over a year now and my skin is amazing!! Follow my YouTube Khaliyah Marie
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Singapore,LOVE IT!,"I’ll usually buy fenty skin cleanser,worked for me but wanted to try these. Tried it today and it work wonders! Love it so much and it’s good for those who usually wear heavy make up. "
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,Lovable,"This product will forever be in my skincare routine, I have repurchased numerous amounts of times, and am absolutely in love with this product. Perfect for taking off makeup without the harsh remover 
wipes."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,OK,"I have mixed feelings about this cleanser. It doesn't get the job done on it's own. I'm first using an oil cleanser to take off my make up and then using this to clean my skin. I like the way my skin feels after. It doesn't feel overly greasy, nor does it strip my skin. I will continue to look for cleansers similar to this, but with a little more oomph."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,My first step,I’m not an everyday make up person but I wear sunscreen daily. This cleanser is affordable and does it’s job and the most important of all is it does not break me out. I second cleanse with cetaphil.
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Very hydrating - beware oily skin users,"This definitely doesn't dry out your skin and I really like that but I feel it's too oily for my oily/combination skin. I started breaking out when using twice a day so now I'm only using it at night and using another cleanser in the morning. This helped my skin clear up and stay hydrated. Not sure if I would buy it again, I guess when I run out of it I'll see how I do with a regular cleanser and if it's actually better for my skin to use this one once a day."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 150ml,"A great basic facial cleanser if that’s what you’re looking for. Amazing for removing makeup, and made my skin feel so soft afterwards."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,Excellent first cleanse,Loving this no frills cleanser to remove my makeup and sunscreen. Does a wonderful job and doesn’t leave a film on skin afterwards. First time trying it today. Great value for an oil based cleanser. Will repurchase.
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Great for one step make up removal,This is great for removing makeup including urban decay 24/7 eyeliners in one go. It does make your eye area a bit foggy but it’s a very thorough cleanse without stripping the face off nutrients.I typically use it after a day of work before heading to the gym so that the sweat doesn’t clog pores and makeup
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,I Prefer My Cleansing Oil :),"I don't like how greasy it feels on my face as I rub it in, but it sure does remove all my makeup in one go! Also it makes your eyes a bit blurry and foggy for a while afterwards. With a cleansing oil I find it's more convenient than something like this as it is more slippery and easier to massage in. Also makes it easier to avoid eyes."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Great for removing makeup,I loved this cleanser. I thought it did a really great job removing makeup. I used it in a double cleanse routine with a more sudsy cleanser following it. My only complaint is that you need a lot of it to remove makeup well. But I thought it was perfect for the price point.
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Safe for sensitive dry skin,"I’ve been dealing with perioral dermatitis for over a year, and I’ve had to go back to this cleanser because it doesn’t bother the PD area or dry my skin out at all. I have sensitive dry to normal skin as well. It also really helps with the excess sebum around my nose and chin! I’m not even using moisturizer on my PD areas, and it’s not dry or flaking at all (it was so dry after the last cleanser I used). As for makeup removal, I find if you rub in on for a bit first, it works very well at removing everything. I’ll continue using this since it seems to be the most effective cleanser I’ve used in the last year."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Singapore,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser,Gentle cleanser that doesn’t leave the skin feeling tight or dry. I use this on days when my face is sensitive or breaking out. It works well. Worth a re-purchase.
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Singapore,Make up remover,"easiest way to remove makeup after a long day. it cleans out and works like a miracle. been using this for a few years now and would not look back, happy sephora is carrying this range. "
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,My go-to cleanser,You have to rub this product in your palms for 5-10 secs before applying to your face. You will feel the product get slick. Game changer ! It leaves my face so clean even after washing off a full face of makeup. And doesn’t leave the skin feeling tight or dry after. Love it !!!
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,Amazing product. 10/10,New fave. It washes off all my makeup even the waterproof mascara and doesn’t leave my skin dry. Amazing product.
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,New favorite cleanser!,"After my first time trying this cleanser, I was hooked. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft, and removes my waterproof mascara like a dream. The other reviews are correct, this is not a sudsy bubbly cleanser, and more of an oil based product. It does well with my combination skin, but may not be the best for oily skin."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 50ml,"One of my favourite cleansers, very affordable and an essential as a first cleanser in a double cleansing routine. Very effective for removing makeup and a little goes a long way and its great for sensitive skin since its unscented."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,love it,"so nice, no smell, great texture.  makes my routine something to look forward to."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 150ml,"I love this brand, and I love their prices. Sadly I was let down with this product, I didn't feel clean afterwards."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 150ml,Shockingly I really love this texture it’s perfect it’s not too oily but also not to thick at first when I used this almost a year ago I didn’t like it but I decided to give it another try and I’m obsessed
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Nothing Inside,"I really don't know how to describe this so-called cleanser. There's barely any product in the tube. It's as though I'm cleansing my dehydrated skin with plain water! No lather, substance. Nothing."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 50ml,"Love this cleanser! I’ve noticed a great difference in my skin, and it leaves my face feeling hydrated. Most cleansers leave my skin feeling dry especially if I don’t immediately use a cleansing balm or moisturizer after a shower. I would highly recommend this cleanser!"
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Melts makeup off,"A nice smooth, melt-y cleanser that takes off makeup- does not foam, stays like a gel/balm but is more towards a liquid."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Love this for first cleanse!,"Gets the job done! Melts sunscreen, foundation, and my waterproof mascara all at once. I rub between my hands to warm it up and to turn it into an oil. Then I massage it all over my face, concentrating on my eyes last. When I get to my eyes, I hold my hands on top of my closed lids so the oil can loosen up the mascara, and then I gently massage to melt it away. I use this as my first step in my double cleanse. Bonus that it’s affordable!"
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,recommend,I would Highly recommend this product and will reorder very soon
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 50ml,I’ve noticed my skin really clearing up. The only thing I don’t like is that normally my cleanser are smooth and will spread across my face but this one I always felt like it just absorbed into one place even when using water
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 50ml,Ridiculous quantity..!! 3/4th of the tube is empty.. Just because I purchased smaller size they gave me just 10ml of the product out of 50
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,Dry skin,This cleanser feels great on my skin. It comes at a good price point. Very good for dry mature skin!
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Singapore,Nice cleanser,Bought this for my boyfriend to try as his looking for a new cleanser. So far his feedback to it is positive and told me that his willing to try more skin care products.
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 150ml,"this is a great cleanser for people with dry skin, although i would recommend using an exfoliating cleanser (like panoxyl or the oil removal cleanser from la roche posay) before this one. it fully cleans iff my makeup, but it doesn't do much as a standalone cleanser."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Not for me,"It will probably work for others, but it does not work for me."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,"okay for price, but wouldn’t repurchase","takes a while to get it to an oil consistency, but it does eventually. i like it for my mascara, but not really on the face. kind of feels like it sits on the makeup rather than sliding it off and i needed to use a lot more product than when using more expensive oil cleansers. for the price it is usuable with more effort. however, i would rather spend more on something that is quicker and feels more clean after. i wouldn’t repurchase, and i think you could find something better in the same price range"
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Amazing,"I love it so much, my skin feels and looks so much better then before and the small size last forever I’ve had it for 6 months and I use it everyday and I just bought a new one"
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 50ml,"I love the feeling, it leave my skin soft and clean i love ittttt"
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Does nothing,Uhmm… it literally does nothing for your skin. When I was using this I couldn’t figure out why my toner pad kept coming out dirty despite using a cleansing brush and pre cleansing. When I switched face washes my cotton pad after toner was clean again.
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Singapore,squalene cleanser,This scent free squalene cleanser is easy on the skin and not drying. It’s great value and good for everyday use! One of my favourite the ordinary products and here to stay
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,not enough cleaning for my skin type,"It's not my first T.O. product so I had high expectations with this one, but it didn't clean my skin as expected, I always had to use some extra product, even for the morning routine I felt it wasn't enough, this was my 1st and last squalane cleanser."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Amazing cleanser! Great for aging skin,One of my all time favorite cleansers (and I’ve tried a lot.). It’s a great anti-aging cleanser. Keeps skin moisturized and clean.
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Great cleanser,I love this cleanser. I have been using it for about 6 months now and can’t imagine using anything else on my face.
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Singapore,nice product,"Creamy and moisturizing face wash but clean the make up efficiently. Better used on a dry face, massage the product to melt the make up then use water."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,AMAZING,"i wear a lot of mascara and this takes it all off. i find the best way to apply it is to put some on your fingers, and tap your whole face to get the product everywhere and THEN start to actually rub it around. the product will be all over your face making it easier to spread and take off your makeup. however, just be careful when using it to clean your eye makeup as sometimes it can irritate your eyes if you get it in them. however, i love it so much that i don’t even care about that. 100% recommend."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,My favorite cleaner!,Since i started using this cleanser i havent stopped. It feels great and even has makeup remover in it which is a plus. Super gentle and leaves my face feeling soft and refreshed .
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,Keeper,"Love this product, it will be in my routine for a while. I don't see myself looking for something new soon. It removes my eye make up without rubbing hard and it's affordable."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,My favorite cleanser!,My favorite cleanser so far! Works great for my skin.
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 150ml,"This doesn't remove makeup/sunscreen very effectively and it doesn't rinse clean - it leaves a film that irritates my skin. For the price I don't expect a particularly luxurious product, but I do expect it to do what it's supposed to, which it doesn't."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,Súper,"Es en aceite y luego cuando lo retiras te deja la piel súper limpia. Solo uso este para limpieza. Tengo la cutís mixto. Pensé que como soy mixta no me funcionaría por el aceite, pero sí creo que es la parte que más disfruto. Compré el pequeño y ahora quiero el grande."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 150ml,"I absolutely love this cleanser, I’ve been using it for a year and a bit now and I’ve seen a drastic overall change in my skin. A little goes a long way and you can’t go wrong for the price."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Buy this!,Great product! feelings amazing on my skin and works amazing with the ordinary serums and moisturizer!
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Singapore,Non-drying,"If you are looking for a cleanser that is non-drying after you wash, then look no further. I have gone through 4 tubs of this and i use this to double cleanse after washing my face with an oil-based balm. 
"
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Cleared my face.,"I've had acne issue's my whole life. This is the first product to actually do something about it. Even my hormonal Acne didn't break the skin. amazing product, I recommend to everyone."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,5 Stars,"Have been using this for over a year and I'll never use a different cleanser. I have sensitive skin and wanted a simple cleanser and this is it. It won't leave your skin feeling stripped, doesn't foam up much at all, and removes dirt and oils gently."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 150ml,"i havent tried the product yet but am convinced i will love it!
just received it in the mail today and will use later on, but i was reading the reviews here and couldnt help but notice a lot of reviews around the same time in 2020 say the bottle is almost half empty or just air. 
i just came here to say it must be a manufacturing issue that has since been resolved (or not and i just got a full bottle), but my bottle is full and i wanted to show what it looks like when it is full. 
i opened it just now, tapped all of the product to the bottom of the container, and this is how much i can squeeze it before product comes out.
i would say still buy the product and just return and get a new one if you experience it being quite empty"
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 150ml,"If you have very sensitive skin, this cleanser is a must have! Both my daughter and I use it with great results – and I am in my 40s and she is in her teens! Very different skin issues, and this works for both of us. Squalane is very gentle and very beneficial for the skin, and The Ordinary has not added all sorts of chemical junk in with it in the cleanser as so many companies do. It’s gentle but effective, great for removing make up, and keeps my skin clear and my pores unclogged. And the price cannot be beat! I’m a big fan of many products by The Ordinary; I’ve done my research and I buy their serums and combine them to suit my needs. I am in my 40s and have very few visible lines. I actually had more in my 30s prior to learning about proper skin care and using these products! I do the same for my daughter who has oily acne prone skin and her face is now clear and her skin has a healthy glow. This is a great product to add to anyone’s skin care regime. It leaves your skin clean and free of residue so it is ready to absorb whatever serum‘s or creams you may use. And at this price it would be silly not to try it. I highly recommend this for anyone with any skin type. You just can’t go wrong with this product."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Great makeup remover,Love that cream to milky consistency! I now auto replenish this! So good for the price! Feels luxurious too!
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Favorite basic cleanser.,"Best second step cleanser. I use this after my harsher makeup-removing cleanser. Gets rid of whatever is left on my skin, doesn't break me out, and my skin feels normal after not too dry. 10/10 from me."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Not great,"On days I am wearing make up, this is great for removing it. However, I almost always washed my face a second time with a different facewash because it never felt like it was really cleaning my skin."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,best cleanser out there,I got this cleanser in the mini because I was unsure but I’m so glad that I bought this it gives my skin a nice glow and it makes my skin so even and hydrated
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,Perfect for Dry & Sensitive Skin,"Such a nice and gentle cleanser for dry skin! Picked this up while traveling and haven’t stopped using it. Does an amazing job of removing makeup, and doesn’t burn my eyes!"
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Singapore,great first cleanse,"I've used this multiple times before and love how clean my face is after using it as the first cleanse, really removes makeup and sunscreen thoroughly. I highly recommend this!"
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser - 150ml,"Great as a double cleanser. I use it while taking off my makeup, before a SA cleanser."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,LOVE,i am super picky with cleansers especially ones that don’t foam up but i absolutely love this one and i will continue to buy because it cleans my skin well and doesn’t dry it out it actually stays moisturized.
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,helped me get my dream skin,"the ordinary products have tremendously helped me to get my dream skin over the past 8 months and I am so thankful for them. they’re perfect for my sometimes oily dry skin, and the cleanser is an amazing start to my daily skincare routine."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,Better for winter months.,"This cleanser/ makeup remover would be fantastic in the winter months. It is creamy, non drying and turns into an oil when water is applied. I find that it is clogging my pores during this hot and humid time of year. While i don't dislike it, I am not loving it for me, right now. I feel that it does not  get rid of the ""dirt"" from my face."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Malaysia,good,"i dont feel like its a holy grail but its fine for my eczema prone skin. it is moisturizing so you should give it a try if you have dry skin. like most cleansers you feel clean and fresh after washing but this cleanser, you definitely can feel the oil in it to help moisturize ur skin. overall i think it cleans just fine. i dont feel super fresh after using. no smell. no weird texture. its an ok product. it has amazing ingredients too. maybe i would purchase again for the convenience of my eczema not flaring up but if i have a better option that makes my skin feel better after cleansing i would totally go for it. "
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Malaysia,Not Bad,It’s really good it can remove your make up as well and I love it because I always wanted a cleanser that really removes my makeup. Another thing I like from this product is it’s less foams easy to apply on the face. After washing my face it doesn’t feels oily or dry it keeps moisturise. 
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Great for oily skin,"Love this for my oily skin, has helped tremendously with the oil production throughout the day."
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,USA,Lifesaver for peri menopause skin!,"I hit 49 and was suddenly faced with peri menopause and all it’s glorious side effects. The worst one is a complete change in my complexion. For the first time, I experienced significant breakouts, blotchy redness and very dry, itchy, flaky skin. The squalane cleanser is my lifesaver. From day one, my skin started to return to normal. And the Azelaic Acid Suspension is the perfect finish. The occasional pimple, patch of dryness, or broken blood vessel are completely gone by morning. I can’t live without this cleanser!!!!"
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Canada,Meh.,"It’s good as a first step of a double cleanse as a cleansing balm, however it dries the crap of my skin, and i have very oily skin. I don’t feel that clean after using so I recommend using a good second cleanse. Stings my eyes and quite difficult to work around on my face. Shame, really wanted to love this :("
THE ORDINARY-Squalane Cleanser,Singapore,okay ,dosent really remove makeup thoroughly and dosent leave my skin feeling clean . regretted getting the full size as i won’t be using it as much . not worth the hype

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Singapore,easy,"i always buy these wet wipes for convenient use and they do take off alot of make up in the evenings. however,  i do find that these wipes, no matter the scent, i find they are strong and stings those with sensitive eyes."

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Malaysia,Ms.,"My go to daily wipes. Doesn’t strip of the face, leaves skin clean. A quick way to remove basic make up like powder. To remove thicker make up, just add a few drops of make up remover on this wipe instead of regular cotton pads. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,New Zealand,Yummy as,I really love these makeup wipes. They smell good and feel great on my skin. they get makeup off easy. I felt really hydrated after but someone with oily skin probably wouldn't like these as they give that coconut oil feel at first till everything settles. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,New Zealand,Cost efficient,"The coconut wipes are my go to, they smell great, work well and aren't too expensive"

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Philippines,Useful but overpriced. ,"This is a useful when you are lazy wiping off your make-up or bumping up your cart when you want to attain the minimum amount to get that discount or freebie.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Singapore,Love it!,Perfect size for travelling as I no longer need to bring a bottle of cleanser & a whole bunch of cotton pads as I always always packed lesser than I expected :( Smells amazing as well. Not drying on skin & removes makeup well.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Australia,Miss,Not the biggest fan of these. Unfortunately they made my skin feel dry and itchy. Could just be the fact that it’s scented or my skin is too sensitive for these. They do smell good though

"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Malaysia,makeup remover,okayyy! not suitable for waterproof or heavy makeup but good with removing sunscreen and light makeup only but for heavy makeup need to use cleansing oil/balm too after wiping with this makeup wipes
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Singapore,review,gave a burning sensation on my face after use but might be because my skin is sensitive. not recommended for people with sensitive skin but smells really good and has cute packaging.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Malaysia,nope,"I think sephora had reformulated the wipes and its not a good decision. Too wet, didn’t take off the makeup any better , the wipes has a weird texture that i dint really like. Used to be the holy grail "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Philippines,Coconutty!,Does the job but nothing to really write home about ✌🏻just needed something to bump up my minimum purchase. not buying again as it’s overpriced for me. Get a pack of Biore instead.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Australia,not for me,I think these cleansing face wipes are very over priced for the quality. I wouldn’t purchase them again. They are no different to what you can find in the supermarket. The result is the same. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Australia,Could be better,"They do a decent job, but dry out really quickly and become unusable. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Australia,fine ,These are easy to use and dispose of. A little overpriced and you can get cheaper alternatives. Best to buy when they are on sale. They are super refreshing though. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Malaysia,HARSH,"This is a harsh wipes. Not suitable for sensitive skin. Found a better product for makeup wipes but this is definitely a NO from me. Sorry. 

Also you only can remove light to medium make up only. Heavy makeup? NOPE."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Malaysia,cleansing face wipe,This is my second time purchasing this face wipe. Love the smell and does not harsh my skin after makeup removal. Soft to the skin and cleans residue well
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Singapore,Disappointed ,Just ineffective at removing make up. Face is still left with traces of makeup so I guess it should be mainly used for only super light makeup. It won’t remove your eyeliner and mascara.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Malaysia,worth every penny,"I love this face wipes. I love the packaging. Its so lovely. It’s worth every penny that i spend. Maybe, i will repurchased this item. I’m happy to share my experiences to other"

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Malaysia,Works wonders,"Thick & easily takes out my mascara in one wipe and smells nice. But for those who prefers non-scented wipes, opt for others!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Australia,not worth the money ! ,I thought these would be more moisturising esp when I saw Coconut on the package! They feel so rough and cheap on the skin so unpleasant !  your better of using an oil to take off your makeup or even pads with micellar water ! What of waste of money they will prob go in the bin !  
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Malaysia,mrs,Kain tisu agak kurang lembab…makeup tidak bersih bila mengunakan tisu nie…sgt tidak puasa hati.                  Next time nk beli tisu jenama lain. Selepas mengunakan muke menjadi kering 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Australia,it does the job at least,They functioned... but there were very few in the package and I ran out very quickly and I don't even use much makeup. Also irritated my eczema a lot. What irritates eczema varies heaps but just take note if you also have eczema on your face.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Singapore,smell is too strong,"I was so excited to use this but the moment I opened it up I was so disappointed. The wipe itself is good because it’s big and effectively removes makeup, but the smell is way too strong and unpleasant! It smells so artificial and I do not like it at all. Especially for an aloe vera fragrant that is expected to be the most mild and refreshing among all other options. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Malaysia,not worth it ,It burns my skin and i don’t like the smell too. It does remove the makeup well but the wipes feel very rough. Not worth the money. Maybe will try the aloe Vera wipe but the product quality I guess would be same so I don’t want to take risk 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing Face Wipe,Malaysia,Good,Easy to use when travel but you still to pour your micellar water or any makeup remover to this wipe to make sure it removee every makeup on your face and even waterproof makeup..and it smells coconut I like it

FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,Works amazing,"I have tried a lot of makeup remover in the form of balm but this is by far the best and it doesn’t coz me any breakout unlike the other brands. I have super sensitive skin for over 15 years and been trying tons of products so I guess my review is justified 😂 works well at removing makeup except the eye area and lips I need to use micellar water. If I rub it around my eyes wrongly, it’ll get into my eyes and make my vision blurry until I washed it thoroughly. It can be watery at the bottom after some time I guess the oil kinda goes to the bottom but it’s not a problem for me. Last for a longggg time for everyday light makeup so I guess it’s a win "

I’m on my second tub now. ❤️"

It's great and worth repurchasing."

What i like about this product is the list of ingredients that is superfood key ingredient that not just cleansing but nourishing my skin as well. It melts all my make up and if i was on heavy makeup i will use my spongey cloth to gently wipe my face(so much better and gentle than wiping tissue) and carry on with gentle cleanser.when it come to cleansing, yes the balm is pricey enough so I balance it with cerave gentle cleanser which more affordable and my skin is happy and healthier now."

FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Singapore,Ms,I was looking for cleansing oil and then chanced upon this product. I decided to buy it after reading all the good reviews. I started using it and it is surprisingly good at removing full make up including the eyes which normally I will use a separate eye makeup removal. It doesn’t sting my eyes at all and it makes makeup removal fuss free. I think I will not go back to cleaning oil for now. 
FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,I gave this 4 star because I just brought this and I don’t know how I feel about it yet. First of all it’s very greasy but it did help remove my makeup from my face with the cotton pad maybe I just need some time getting use to it
FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,Ms,It smells great. Did not remove my makeup thoroughly though. And is it just me who feel that it irritates my eyes more than other products that I have used before?
FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Smells amazing!!!,"I could literally just smell this jar all day long. It is absolute papaya heaven! A little scoop takes off ALL my makeup, including eye makeup and mascara. It melts into a creamy oil instantly as you rub it in and it feels so good on my skin. I actually look forward to taking off my makeup because of this product."
FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,the best make up cleansing balm!,"I work as a model and this balm never fails to remove the toughest strongest make up. It doesn’t do a 1 second magic on waterproof mascara but with just a little bit of effort everything comes off absolutely perfectly.
When applying, I usually warm up the product by rubbing my palms together, then apply a bit of the product on my eyes and lashes, leave it on there to soften the make up and continue to work on the rest of my face and come back to the eyes at last. 
I’ve recommend this product to every single person and trust me I’ve tried a lot of the balms out there.
Ordering my second tub right now!!"
FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,does what it’s suppose to,"i am on the hunt for a new cleansing balm so i got this as a trial size. at first use i wasn’t the biggest fan of the smell, but the product works well if you can get passed that. a little goes a long way, starting as a balm that turns to an oil as you work it into your skin. most makeup cleaning balms make my eyes burn, this is gentle enough that i can even open my eyes without issue. will need to continue using this product, but it’s the only one so far that hasn’t burned my eyes."
FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Singapore,HOLY GRAIL,if there is one product that i absolutely love and will repurchase all the time it is this one. it is sooooooooooo good. i cannot recommend this enough. nothing has come close to this amazing product. 
FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,great cleansing balm indeed,"I tried the sample one and it works amazing in removing my makeup. Thus getting the full size. It is so easy to use, didnt sting my eyes and east to bring during travel 👍🏻"
FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,Worth the hype,This melting balm totally worth the hype! I was using Wishful balm and of cos it’s great! Both balms does a good job in removing heavy make up. Especially my water proof mascara. But Farmacy gets extra brownie points cos it doesn’t sting my eyes. And it doesn’t leave the milky residue when washing. SO IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT!
FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,Multiple repurchases,"I take back what I said about only using this cleansing balm for heavier makeup days. I have grown to love this so much that I look forward to starting my nighttime skincare with this every night. The scent is heavenly, and it feels lightweight in comparison to other cleansing balms that somehow feel like they’re stuck to my skin even after the 2nd cleanse. My only gripe is that sometimes not all of the balm will melt at the same time for some unknown reason (my current working hypothesis is that my hands are sometimes too cold to even warm the product up and melt the product in a uniform manner). Sometimes it does melt uniformly and beautifully, fuss free. Other times, some tiny “harder” bits won’t melt and then get in between my fingers and I have to scoop the bits back into my palm and take an extra 5 seconds to smoosh them with a single finger to get them to melt. I don’t experience this with other Asian cleansing balms. Doesn’t change my love for this product though."
FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Singapore,Cleansing Balm,This product is my holy grail!!! I first tried the small sample and I really love it so much that I bought the original size to use. The smell is nice and really helps to clean my makeup away

It doesnt strip my moisture = skin feels supple and hydrated after wash and it doesnt burn/ cause irritation on my eye area. Love it so much that i got the original sized tub ❤️
FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,don’t use it for eye makeup removal,"Pros
It melts my entire face makeup off very easily and it smells good. 

Cons
it needs a little bit of more massaging in my eyes to remove mascara . it leaves me with a cast in my eyes and it makes it hard for me to see. 

I don’t think I’ll be getting this again"
FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"Emulsified well and removed my makeup, however not impressed with it dues to the amount of product I had to use for my whole face and it left my eyes cloudy after washing off my mascara with it. I’ll continue to use this product until it’s gone but it’s unfortunate I have to use micellar water in my eyes and can’t use this for my whole face. Probably not worth the money for how quickly I’ll use it, and a hassle to avoid getting it near my eyes."
FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Singapore,Gentle makeup cleanser,"Price point is on the high side but just a lil bit of this product goes a long way! Gentle, doesn't dry out skin or leave a film residue after cleansing. "
FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Try something else if you wear mascara,I had high hopes for this but it does nothing for mascara and eyeliner and that’s what I struggle with removing the most. I used to use the Monat Makeup vanishing balm and nothing has ever compared but I don’t wanna pay the shipping for it lol :(
FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Singapore,Great cleanser!!,"it definitely melt away makeup!! i love the fact that i dont need to use cotton and makeup remover anymore!! coz i tend to stratched the eye area when removing waterproof mascara. with this, i dont need to... 👍🏼👍🏼 just massage gently and waterproof mascara is gone!!

FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Nice cleansing balm,I skeptical when it comes to trying new cleansing balms. The Clinique cleansing balm is my tried and true. I grabbed this one before I went to swim in the lake with a friend and needed something fast and small. I was pleased with the results. Emulsified really well if you’re sensitive to fragrance although this one is light it’s noticeable and smells kinda like a candy or lime and I liked it. Does kinda leave a film on the eyeballs but wasn’t irritating.

FARMACY-Green Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Philippines,best cleansing balm ever,I have switched from the Clinique Cleansing Balm to the Farmacy one because it is gentle on the skin and I also love the smell of this.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Triple Action Cleansing Micellar Water,Singapore,works well,works as well as many of the better drugstore branded micellar waters on the market. also comparable in price to these micellar waters at the larger volumes
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Triple Action Cleansing Micellar Water,Malaysia,compact size suitable for travelling,"Own the 200ml pack size and buy a smaller one for travelling purposes. Cheap, no harsh chemical ingredients, and effective to remove makeup on my sensitive combination skin without irritation."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Triple Action Cleansing Micellar Water,Singapore,good,"bought the 400ml one as it has a different pump design which makes it easier to dispense on cotton pads. removes make up easily with just one swipe, even the waterproof make up as well."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Triple Action Cleansing Micellar Water,Singapore,2nd purchase ,I really enjoyed removing my make-up with this   micellar water is really good and I use it with a cotton pad but recently I've think I've used oil-based remover and I use this just to ensure that there is no more dirt so I really like this product

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Triple Action Cleansing Micellar Water,Australia,meh but works ,I really liked it but I could easily find an even cheaper one that does the same thing! Also don’t get this in your eye by accident! It does really help the makeup removal process but also drags your makeup off your face instead of actually taking it off. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Triple Action Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Smells awful,"This product works well to remove makeup but it smells absolutely terrible. I've never bought micellar water with a strong scent before, so I didn't consider that as a possibility when purchasing this one. I really should have read the ingredients before buying it. I think it has some really awful artificial fragrance in it. It's not at all appealing to use on your face. And it's a huge bottle so it would feel wasteful to just throw it away."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Triple Action Cleansing Micellar Water,Singapore,Ms,It stings my skin. The smell is also a push away factor… still prefer the old original triple action cleansing water. Frankly a total let down thinking this is the enhanced make up remover but I was wrong.

I usually need about 2 pads to remove a full face of make up which is a bit annoying, however I really love that this cleanser doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin! At this price I’ll most likely buy again - It’s currently my go-to for make up removal."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Triple Action Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,a Hard NO,"Definitely NOT A FAN! It takes forever to take waterproof makeup off & they stopped carrying the Sephoria blue oil makeup remover in the stores, so now I have to use shipping & trying really hard to not order online.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Triple Action Cleansing Micellar Water,Malaysia,fine,"This does remove my makeup, but it takes a bit of effort. On days when I'm wearing minimal makeup it's fine, but when I'm wearing a more full coverage foundation and more eye makeup it takes a lot of the micellear water and a lot of time and patience (which I don't really have when it comes to removing makeup) to remove. It also leaves my skin feeling quite dry. I usually wouldn't mind that too much if the makeup remover takes my makeup off easily, but this just doesn't."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Triple Action Cleansing Micellar Water,Singapore,okay,Like a regular micellar water does its job. Not too strong and i still use oil cleansing before or after this step. Overall good for make-up corrections during the process.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Triple Action Cleansing Micellar Water,Malaysia,Good one,It removes the make up completely. A small amount is sufficient to use each time. Not smelly at all. I have skin eczema thus if I use other remover my face  have little burning sensation however with this remover I don't feel such sensation at all. Highly recommended.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Triple Action Cleansing Micellar Water,Malaysia,Fuss Free Cleanser,"Does its job as expected, cleans well but not too sure about the “no-rinse” part because it leaves a somewhat oily/wet look on the face after removing the make up. I still use my normal face wash after that to properly clean my face."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Triple Action Cleansing Micellar Water,Singapore,love it ,I usually use this on days when I'm wearing heavier or thicker makeup and use it before double cleansing. so far so good. doesn't feel too harsh on my skin. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Triple Action Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Sephora Collection Triple Action Cleansing Micellar Water - 50ml,This product is a good micellar water. I haven’t noticed too much of a difference between this one in the original though
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Triple Action Cleansing Micellar Water,Australia,Need to buy a bigger version!,"This micellar water is the best one I have tried; a little bit will still work effectively and actually remove my make up. Other ones I have tried, I can use a lot and make up won't be removed. This one is a great size that I can take travelling but I definitely need to invest in a bigger one because it is great! "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Triple Action Cleansing Micellar Water,Singapore,love it ,Bought a bigger bottle so it's more money worthy. This product doesn't sting my face and has a pleasant smell. Might be repurchasing it once my bottle runs out.

GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Favorite Face Wash,Hands down my favorite! The smell isn’t over powering and it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I did the travel size since I’m trying new skincare because I’m almost 30 and my skin has decided to make the change.
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,removes makeup n smells good,"I love this cleanser. It smells good, and it removes all traces of makeup.

Highly rcommended"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,This is the only face wash I consistently keep coming back to after trying other ones. It’s the only one that makes my face feel clean without feeling dry. I love it!

GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,A Little Goes a Long Way,"I like how long this product lasts. A little goes a long way. It's not too special in what it does. At least I didn't feel a difference, but man this product lasts a long time. I bought a regular sized bottle and it lasted me more than a year. I wash my face twice a day, everyday. All I need is a small dollop, and you can get that from barely pumping the bottle, and I can wash my whole face with it. It's no wonder it lasted so long!"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 30ml,When I first bought this product i had a bump on my chin that went away soon after using this cleanser. pretty good
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,There are better cleansers,"This product was recommended to me, not a fan of fragrance in the product. The product itself is basic, after using it a couple of times I didn’t see a difference in my face. It does not seem that hydrating as well."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,kinda boring. gentle but not as moisturizing as I like my cleansers. it was a chore to use up the mini bottle I bought
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Not impressed,"This was my first purchase from Glow Recipe and I was super excited to try their products, but unfortunately was massively let down by this cleanser. It broke me out in most areas of my face, especially along the jaw and hairline, but Ikept using it hoping my skin was just adjusting and I would eventually love it. 4 months of using it and I finally gave up, I hadn’t struggled with breakouts in 2 years before using this cleanser so it was a big let down. A week back on my go-to cleanser (Youth To The People!) and my skin is already clearing up."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,favourite cleanser ever ,"my favourite cleanser ever. makes my face feel so clean and so soft after every use, doesn’t dry me out at all. I have combination skin and this works amazingly! "

Cleanser.  It is so gentle I can use it to wash my eyelash extensions.  When I use it on my skin it feels clean."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,My must cleanser!,Is my favorite from this brand! I will recommended for a combination-oily skin type. You feel free of oil and prepare for your skin care routine
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,I like it!,"My face so far has not dried, I have combination skin. Does remove make up, scent is not that strong for me as others have reviewed. I love this product wish it came in a bigger bottle and less pricey."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,Not for dry skin,I won’t recommend this cleanser for anyone with dry skin. I find the cleanser makes my dry skin even more dry after only few days usage. I couldn’t even finish the bottle.
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,"Really wanted to love it, it smells lovely and the suds are nice, but I found it to be stripping/drying, and it takes more work than usual to rinse off all the suds."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,I want to like this...,I started liking this but continues use for my skin caused drying around the nose and mouth.  I do love the low foam and I have had worst gel cleansers. I have normal skin but but I am now dealing with dry skin.
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,"This smells amazing, I like the lather. It can be drying to those with sensitive skin or dry skin. I would recommend to pair this with an intense moisturizer."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,love it but hate the price ,I bought during sale. First time using it i feel so calm & love the scent! Calming my routine for cleansing but for the price its quiet expensive to me (normal price). Based on the results after using 1 bottle i can conclude that it is just a soft cleanser with a light texture suitable for normal/dry or sensitive skin
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Great product for my sensitive combination skin!,"I found a lot of cleansers would pull all of the moisture from my skin along with the dirt and makeup from the day, but after using this one - my skin feels super soft and clean without that tight, dry feeling. I also haven't experienced irritation or breakouts with this cleanser, like some cause for me. I definitely recommend!"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,I don’t see the hype. Not very moisturizing and the smell is faint. Many more cleansers out there better than this one.

GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,its pretty good,i would buy it again if it wasnt for the price because it cleansed my skin really love
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,light cleanser,"I didn’t feel like it cleaned my face well, it says deep cleanser but it feels very light. I only use it in the morning after cleaning my face at night when I’m on vacation since it comes in the travel size. I also feel like I need 3 pumps for it to do its job."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Double charged,Love the products but I was double charged for one of my purchases. Didn’t realize til I got home
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Fresh smooth skin,Great product. Leaves your skin feeling smooth and fresh. Definitely will always have this in my skincare routine
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,not my favorite,"it does an okay job only. it has a lot of foam, if you prefer more gentle, less foam cleanser this is definitely not something you are looking for. i have tried few cleanser and still go back to fresh soy cleanser at the end"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,loved the moisturising effect after usage,"easy and convenient to use, with great moisturising effect leavong your face feeling plump with the scent of blueberry!
loved the travel size as its compact and perfect for travels"

GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 30ml,I have oily skin but my cleanser has been drying me out right on my cheeks. I needed something gentle but still able to help with the amount of oil I produce. This has been working just great. Happy to have found this product.
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,a nice basic cleanser,It’s a nice everyday basic cleanser. I haven’t noticed any major improvements in my skin but I haven’t noticed anything worse about it either. Probably won’t repurchase but if you want a basic cleanser that smells like blueberries then you’ll probably enjoy this
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,smell good,the cleanser smell really good and it cleanses skin well. it doesn't leave your face feeling very dry out but probably wouldn't repurchase due to the price point as I believe there are cheaper cleanser out there that does the same job. 
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,"Pretty underrated- I’m surprised more people aren’t talking about this. It’s a great basic cleanser, cleans my skin without over stripping it. The formula is jam packed with antioxidants which is nice, and this smells amazing. If only it were a little more affordable"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,love love LOVE,The only cleanser I care to buy! It’s the only one that completely rids the extra oil from my T-zone without completely stripping the moisture from the rest of my face. Highly recommend for combination skin! I never use other cleaners anymore!
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"oh my gosh this face wash is amazing! I bought the small version first and had to buy the bigger one next. Absolutely do not regret it, have now gone through a 160mL bottle and just bought another. Skin feels so clean and fresh and helped clear up my face. Definitely would recommend"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,Love everything about it,"This is my 2nd purchase and in a bigger bottle.  I fell in love with the scent of the cleanser and how it cleanses throughly but not drying for the skin. The scent is a perk me up early in the morning and a happy
 booster for the night when I cleanse my
 face using this."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Loved it!,"This is my new favorite cleanser! First off, the smell is incredible! Second, I have combination skin, and I find this fits me perfectly. My skin doesn't feel stripped or greasy afterwards, and I haven't noticed any breakouts or reactions to this product. I had a free sample that convinced me to buy the full size, and I actually look forward to using this every night! 

I have been using this with the cleansing balm on occasion, but that hasn't really made the results feel any different. I'm mostly just obsessed with the scent in this, it's very fruity but not overpowering (to me anyways). I will definitely repurchase!"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,"Really love this cleanser for my sensitive skin. Still trying to figure out my skin type, but during this hot summer my skin has been pretty much of a combination. Gave it only 4 stars because there isn’t any significant thing it does or changes. This is just a good cleanser that smells good and feels comfortable and refreshing on the skin. Great for makeup removal and not stripping at all!"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,"I use this all the time! It erases my make up like a sponge and I have seen a reduction in my acne since using this. Although I use this every other day, it is so light weight and not tacky like my usual cleansers."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,Perfect for sensitive skin! And its smells so niceee
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 30ml,"This product is amazing. I have struggled with acne and breakouts for years, and nothing would work to get it to go away. However, within a few days of trying this product, it went away. This has made my skin so clear and has caused my breakouts to stop. I 100% recommend using this."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 30ml,"This cleanser did not help with my skin. I did not get any glow, nor did it help with an of my acne."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Not for me,"It’s a decent cleanser and smells really good, but it tends to leave my normal skin pretty dry. I feel like it isn’t doing anything for my skin like other cleansers have. I recommend this for people with oily skin but other than that, I’m going to stick to Glossier’s milky jelly cleanser. A rare miss from Glow Recipe for me!"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,Blueberry gentle cleanser,The cleanser is able to clean makeup and yet so gentle on skin. skin feels soft after using. love items from glow recipe and had tried few items from the brand. 
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,love this cleanser. it’s gentle but effective,I love this cleanser. It’s super gentle and smells wonderful. It gets all the dirt and grime out and leaves my face feeling clean but not stripped of moisture. I use one pump and it creates a really nice lather.  I really love the packaging as well.
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,Not that great,Does what it is suppose to do but skin feels tight and slight tingle on skin upon use. Not suitable for my skin which can be sensitive. Only product under this brand that I don't intent to repeat.
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,love it~,This is my second bottle. I love how clean my face after cleansing it. 🙂 it didn’t irritated my skin when I cleansing which I happy about it and my skin was smooth after cleansing . I was worried when I buying it for the first time since some product may cause my skin dry after cleansing yet this product surprise me. Love the smell as well. 😊
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,Using since 2 months I have oily skin but this does good job. Feels good to my skin  as well.
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Berry wonderful!,"I love this face wash. I have oily skin and it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean, plus it has really helped with my cystic acne which is an absolute blessing. The scent is light and pleasant too. I have no complaints whatsoever."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Leaves Skin Feeling Tight,This leaves your skin feeling tight and dry after use. The scent is very strong. This is more of a perfume than a facial cleanser.
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,This does a great job of removing sunscreen and sweat off of my face without stripping it. It has a really nice gel-like consistency and scent. however the scent might be too much for someone with sensitive skin.
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,MY HOLY GRAIL CLEANSER,"YESS ONE THOUSAND TIMES OVER. This smells so freaking good it’s my favorite cleanser. Other cleansers kinda smell weird like the Drunk Elephant one which was kind of disappointing BUT THIS ONE DID NOT LET ME DOWN. If you have hormonal breakouts or random breakouts pls buy this. I haven’t had a breakout since using this consistently. The tiny bottle lasted me about 3 1/2 months bc I only use one pump. I’d recommend applying water to your face prior to the cleanser, putting a pump in to your hands and adding a tiny amount of water just to create a lather and then scrub away! My favorite, I swear it cleared up some of my clogged pores and after use I can see my pores are smaller!"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,"It used to be my go-to but for some reason my skin HATES it now… It has been making my skin red and irritated on and off for months because of the fragrance. Honestly, unless your skin requires daily exfoliation — which is rarely the case, I wouldn’t recommend it. Plus, it doesn’t do much to maintain smooth texture or even skin tone, so it’s not that worth it in my opinion."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,love ,smells really good and really gently on my skin. i have a combination of dry and oily skin n it works perfectly on me. worth buying during the 30 percent off sale 
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 30ml,"I bought this for the first time and I was amazed! I currently only use cerave for skincare but after finding this I am definitely adding it to my routine. This made my face breakouts fade away, made my face smoother, and brighter skin!! Definitely recommend."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,try it,It ok. I couldn’t do an entire review but it does strip your face not very moisturizing. It does not remove makeup
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,I really wanted to like this...,"While this cleanser definitely cleanses, I felt it stripped my skin wayyy too much. For reference, my cleanser for the past year has been Peach & Lily Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser. After I washed my face with this Glow Recipe cleanser, my skin felt tight and dry almost immediately after drying off my face. I never had that happen with my other cleanser, so I'll be returning this one. Maybe it's a good fit if you have more oily skin, but for my combination skin, this is a no-go. Also, I think the scent is somewhat overpowering. It doesn't really smell like blueberries to me, but more like a powdered candy. I wish I had liked it though!"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,best cleancer,"Pencuci ni pun Best.. Wangi je muka.. Muka jadi lembut.. Tak kasar.. Jerawat kurang naik dah sekali.. By thd way, memang akan repeat order pencuci ni.. Menyesal kalau stock habis"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Does not remove makeup,"It’s a nice cleanser but it doesn’t do anything in the way of removing makeup, so it’s good if that’s what you’re looking for."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Nice gentle cleanser,"Really nice, gentle cleanser with a subtle sweet smell. I thought it was really inoffensive, but the cleanser itself was great. I haven't used it with make up yet, but great for every day :)"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,"This gentle cleanser is amazing, it’s very preventative of my acne breakouts, especially after a workout, and it’s so smooth and it exfoliates too which is perfect, and a little can go a long way, also the texture is awesome!! Ok so I love the product :)"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,very gentle - but overpriced,Very gentle cleanser that cleanses well without stripping. Love the cute packaging. Bought the small size great for travel. I really do not enjoy the fragrance though. Smells like candy artificial blueberry. 
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Perfect to wash with lash extensions,"Since I’ve gotten my lash extensions I struggled with getting make up off without using oil based products. This one is perfect to give myself a real face cleanse and not worry about my extensions. Cleans nicely, leaves my face feeling squeaky. My new fav face wash."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,My new favorite cleanser!,Very concentrated! Half a pump is the perfect amount to clean the face! Foams up easily! Not drying and leaves my face feeling bouncy. Amazing ingredients
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,"Bought this facial wash because I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the skii facial wash. This is not a good substitute. Love their toner,  serum and face mask...but this facial wash just does nothing for me."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Perfect Summer Cleanser,"I’ve been using this on and off for a few years but I’ve been really using it consistently these past few weeks and it’s definitely improved the texture of my skin. I normally gravitate (and prefer) towards BHAs but I love how clean this makes my skin feel especially with this hot weather/humidity. It removes makeup (mascara and eyeliner) pretty well too and I like how it lathers up. I’ve always bought/used the minis but I think I might get a full size for this season. I’m not sure about using it in the winter since remember it making my face feel tight, but I know I’ll continue using it for the next few months!"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,One of my faves,"I really like this cleanser. I am always on a search for a great cleanser. I have combo/mature skin that still breaks out from time to time and this one works for me. I really like the sweet blueberry smell and yeh way it foams up and also leave my skin squeaky clean. Also it actually takes of my makeup, I don’t wear foundation, only tinted spf and some concealer if needed and blush."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,makes skin so soft and clean!,"I love the way this cleanser makes my skin feel. It removes my makeup super well and doesn’t leave me feeling stripped. I also love the smell and beautiful packaging! I haven’t read this in any other reviews but every time I pump the cleanser into my hands and go to put it on my face, the product falls off my hands every time! The texture is like jelly when it first pumps out and doesn’t adhere to skin super well. Unfortunately this has lead to a lot of product wasted."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,SO PAINFULLY AVERAGE,"I really wanted to get behind this, however it felt like I was washing my face with a jelly perfume. I really WOULD NOT spend money on this."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,I see so many reviews about this not being for dry skin but man I have dry sensitive skin and this is the first cleanser to ever work for me. This in combination with the watermelon moisturizer has completely saved my skin. It’s light and smells so good and a little goes a long way which I love. I bought the mini size to give it a try and it has lasted me so long even though I use it twice per day.
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,drying,"totally dried out my normal skin. if you don't have oily skin,do not use."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Nothing special,"It's a fine cleanser, but not worth the money in my opinion."

GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,worth it! squeaky clean!,"This product is amazing! I was using youth to the people gentle green or whatever. I might as well washed with air. I recently started incorporating more glow recipe products and it really has made a huge difference on my skin. I use this cleanser after make up remover oil cleanser. It’s not too drying, just clean enough. Make me skin feel refreshed and squeaky."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,it really is genlte,I use it daily and it really is gentle on the skin. Its good. My skin feels soft and does not feel tight or drying. The blueberry smell is nice. Not too strong. Can consider buying again. 
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,just okay,It’s just a so so cleanser. Not that impressed with it especially with the price. It’s heavily scented so I wouldn’t really get it again since I prefer my every day cleanser to be gentle and fragrance free. Good that there’s a smaller bottle for testing. 
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Love it!,I have pretty sensitive skin and this cleanser feels so nice. It doesn’t dry my skin out and even though it’s fragranced it doesn’t irritate my skin either.
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,love this gentle cleanser,Love this cleanser. I have SUPER sensitive skin and most cleansers do irritate it whereas this one does not. The scent is super light (kinda wish it was a little stronger) but my face smells and feels clean after every use and my skin is looking good already after a few weeks
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,"Gentle, effective + the delicious blueberry aroma","HG!! I use this as the second step in a double cleanse after a cleansing oil. Gently cleans without making my combo dry skin taut or uncomfortable. A little goes a long way, so this bottle lasts a long time. Added bonus: the delicious fresh blueberry pie aroma. LOVE it!"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Love it!!!!!,I love this cleanser!!!!! It’s gentle enough to use it on sensitive skin and you don’t need a lot of this product! A little goes a long way!!
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,not worth it,This cleanser made my skin SO dry and breakout. Definitely not for sensitive and/or dry skin! And the smell of it is just not worth it either. Glow Recipe does better products than this one.
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Works great,"It has a good lather. It smells good, so that's a bonus. It took off my waterproof mascara and eyeliner. That's the main reason I got it"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,amazing must have,I have sensitive acne prone skin cleanser that don’t have salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide don’t work on my skin. This cleanser is holy grail for taking off my make up to just cleanser and have my skin feel clean and amazing
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,not for me,"The scent is very nice and it left my skin feeling really clean, but it did give me dry patches, so I suggest this would be better for oily skin not prone to dryness."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,"Really drying, you will need to put moisturizer on your face after using this."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,I have oily skin and literally every other oily skin face wash I used before would just make my skin feel so dry and tight it was actually painful but this one doesn’t do that at all and I love it.
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Worth Buying!,Just recently purchased this and I have to say that I’m absolutely in love with this cleanser. Within the first few I noticed that my skin was clearer and softer. I also noticed that any congestion that I had on my face was disappearing as well. It doesn’t dry your skin if you have combination/oily skin and I found that it actually helped with that. I use it with the toner and day lotion and my skin just looks so much better now. I absolutely love this skincare line.
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Canada,love it,"After first use I was not impressed, I didn’t find it very cleansing and I put it aside for just travel use. Well I ran out of my way normal cleanser and I started using this blueberry stuff after my oil cleanse and WELL let me tell you my mind has changed, my skin has cleared and it’s soft and smooth. I am not a huge fan of scented but it’s very light and does not seem to bother me even tho I do have sensitive skin. I am not giving 5 starts because of the price and because it does not do a good job cleans ingredients make up it has to be used as a second cleanse after an oil."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,Not bad,"I recently had a bad breakout due to some cleanser product. Decide to give this try in a smaller bottle as the huge one sold out. The first time i tried, my skin felt too tight and it was drying out. I had to quickly use the glow recipe toner, serum and moisturizer. Then on the second day, i cleanse my face again with this product and my skin became really soft. I dont feel the tightness anymore. Its quite fast for my skin to get use to the cleanser. You shld try the whole set of glow products to feel the difference. This cleanser is good as it clears all the makeup on ur face completely. "
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,nop,"I don’t like it , this cleanser leaves my skin very dry and escamosa"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,THIS IS MY FACE CLEANSER,"Let me tell you, this girl went through ALOT of cleanser and face soap in finding the perfect one. I have t bone combo skin, and pores on the nose, chin, and cheeks. Plus my skin is sensitive. I love the feel and smell it leaves on my skin, so fresh and clean without drying or being too harsh. I also use this to clean off makeup. Just the perfect feeling of AHHH when your day is done. LOVE LOVE LOVE"
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,"Winner winner, chicken dinner!","Winner winner, chicken dinner!  This face wash is so expensive but so so worth it.  It is such a pleasure to use… so gentle and soothing.  This is what I should have been using all along.  For years I’ve used Estée Lauder’s Perfectly Clean which I do actually love but there is something about this Glow Recipe face wash that leaves you wanting to wash your face all the time.  IF the price was less expensive I would repeatedly continue to purchase.  In the meantime I will be purchasing both.  Estée Lauder last a very long time in comparison to the Glow Recipe."
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,I love this cleanser. I got the travel size in a gift set and it was by far my favorite part. It doesn’t foam right if the bottle but it does get nice and foam on your face. It smells heavenly and subtle. It made a noticeable difference in my skin and I got more compliments on my skin after using. It doesn’t leave my face feeling dry. I honestly just love it so much.
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Glow Recipe Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser - 160ml,Nothing special. Barely emulsified and cleaned my face.
GLOW RECIPE-Blueberry Bounce Gentle Cleanser,USA,Pretty Nice,"I think it is a pretty good cleanser, it doesnt quite remove my mascara well, but it leaves my skin feeling soft. The smell is nice and faint. The product is quite thick in consistency, and can be difficult to lather. I used it in the morning and night for 2 days and can already tell a difference! This is for someone who likes light cleansers that doesn't use makeup too often."
TATCHA-Dewy Cleanse And Hydrate Duo (Christmas Limited Edition),Malaysia,Great set for Good products ,"I’ve been wanting to try Tatcha but didn’t want a full bottle commitment as I’ve read some mixed reviews here. 

Glad I got this set. Great offer. Love the cleanser. Not stripping, skin feels clean, nice & soft! Lovely. I used the Camellia cleansing oil that came for free (1 satchet) after which I used the cleanser. LOVE IT. 

Not a fan of the Dewy cream though. Slightly on the oily side for me. I didn’t use a lot but still not a fan. 

I have combi, sensitive skin with rosacea. Dry cheeks. No bad reaction thus far. However I cautioned you to do more research as people who may have sensitivity to rice, might not fare as well. 

4⭐️"
FRESH-Skincare Prep Essentials (Christmas Limited Edition),Singapore,Great as gifts,"Great as a gift. Love this set as it contains such useful items. Honestly I'm not a super fan of Fresh, but these sets make me wanna get them to give away. Decent brand and very presentable. "
FRESH-Skincare Prep Essentials (Christmas Limited Edition),Malaysia,great gift,"The holiday packaging is just too cute! This is so great as a gift as well 💝 Plus, love the products in this gift set! Definitely eyeing the other holiday gift sets from Fresh ✨"
FRESH-Skincare Prep Essentials (Christmas Limited Edition),Australia,feels nice!!!,Well I love the rose fragrance in it. Toner feels great on my skin. And simple rose water might do just same. Too early to judge it’s affects though. Nothing out of the ordinary.
FRESH-Skincare Prep Essentials (Christmas Limited Edition),Singapore,fresh best-seller set ,this is really value and worth for money! the toner itself is valued at $38.00 so you basically get the soy face cleanser for free. this was really worth it since i always wanted to try their products but they were too expensive for my liking.
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,average,Good for the price but there’s better out there like the Bondi sands melt me cleansing balm. I find this grainy and thick. I also think this is overrated. 
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Philippines,residue,"I wanted to like this, because my face did look nice after using it, but I think that was because of the residue that was left behind after washing it off. looks nice, but doesn't feel nice."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,I love this a lot,"This was the best buy from inkey list. Its so cheap and a little is good to clean the whole face. The whole tube lasts so longggggg. I used it almost everyday and it lasted me over 6 months. So cheap and worth it
"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Singapore,A NEED,"My absolute favourite first cleanse, it is so good for sensitive skin and helped to calm my skin when it was breaking out. It's gentle, calming and gets the job done. I also love that it comes in a big tube. "
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Singapore,not for me,Did not work for me. Leaves my skin with a weird film feeling on top. Althought price point is great but this is really trial and error. Try with caution. 
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,oat review ,"genuinely a great cleanser - the balm texture takes a bit to get used too but it leaves my face so soft and smooth.                                           
"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,It works!,I love this balm. I love how I don’t have to scoop it out and how affordable this is. Its on heavier balm side but boy my pores thank this product for scraping off all the makeup residue. After wash might need to clean with cleanser but I’m not mad at all. I love this. 
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,Emulsify well,i love inkey list product and i love this cleansing oat balm it just so nice to use as prewash as it doesnt oil your face when it emulsify with water. Repeated
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,easy balm cleanser ,I’ve repurchased this cleansing balm twice as it does a great job removing both my face makeup as well as waterproof mascara. Not to mention the affordable price for the amount of product! It might feel too oily for some people however it washes off nicely and leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated. 
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,ok meh,It’s balm. So feel like still sticky after wash out. So need to double wash later with other facial cleanser. Smell is neutral. Not sure if I would like to purchase again.
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,oat cleansing balm ,this is a good cleansing balm to remove face makeup and sunscreen. great first cleanser but doesn’t remove my mascara very well. i definitely will repurchase again! :) 
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Singapore,The Inkey List Oat Cleasing Balm ,Great cleansing balm for removing a full face of makeup. You have to get quite a little product for the cleansing though - texture wise not bad and smell is okay
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Singapore,The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm,"The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm is a lovely, effective cleanser that will appeal to those who enjoy rich, thick textures.

After using it, my face felt extremely clean. However, I'm not a big fan of it as it contains a scrub-like texture and can be a bit rough on the skin if doing double cleansing often."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm - 150ml (Original),I've been using inkey list products religiously for the past three months and my skin has improved drastically. I didnt notice improvement until week 5. Oat cleansing balm is my favorite. some people don't like the texture but I love it. my skin feels so soft and is so clear.
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Singapore,not for me,felt a bit sticky and dry upon application. not sure about the effectiveness after using it long term as I just couldn't get used to the balm texture. just not for me. found an oil-based alternative
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,The most easy using balm,"After saw many good comments on YT and IG, I finally try outthia cleansing balm. It's really easy to apply, melted the makeup and clair them out. Very impressed abt the effectiveness and the bargain on the price."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,great product at a reasonable price ,"This product is great for the price! Silky texture, almost like a vaseline. Feels great on my skin and it’s super mild for my sensitive skin. Does the job- takes all my makeup off and the daily grime. Would definitely recommend if looking for a cheaper product. "
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,New Zealand,Product came expired?,Was so excited to use this but unfortunately could not get past the old rancid product smell. Maybe I got a bad batch but I told Sephora and they didn’t even refund me so sold it second hand. 
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Philippines,Kinda Leaves My Face Oily,"This product had so much promise! It's one of those things I can say that ""Tiktok made me buy."" However, in my experience, it has a bit of an oily-feel vs. how it is shared by other influencers. It does give the feels of cleanliness though, I'd give it that. But it doesn't fully clean my face from makeup. I can name other makeup cleansers out there that I've tried. Guess I had so much hopes and faith in this product but it didn't deliver as much. It's not overly that great for me. When I clean my face with just this, there's still a lot of makeup residue. So now I always use a makeup remover before using this to wash my face afterwards, just so that I can use it up. I don't think I will repurchase though. Because after this, it gives my that oily-feel so I still wash my face with another cleanser. Took me much more steps."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Doesn’t work,This product doesn’t remove my makeup very well and leaves a thick layer of moisturizer on my skin. I would not recommend it.
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,So worth it,I like the consistency of the cleanser. It feels smooth and gentle on my skin. Not regret buy it. Also it doesnt feels tight on my skin. Can repeat buy them.
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,Awesomeee,"Clean-excellently! I will definitely repurchase, like always via Sephora the cheapest compare to other platform... It is very important to use skincare so that our face will forever beautiful"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Great Product at any price,"so gentle, smells good, works great.  I love it to take off heavy eye make up -- no tugging at my eyes"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,First Cleanse ,"I love Inky list, but this isn’t their best product. It does the job but the consistency of the product is really thick and goopy. You need to add water BEFORE you put it on your face. I used it up but am not motivated to re-buy."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Leaves a residue and smells bad.,"I used the product for almost a week, then threw it away.  The scent is very off-putting, and I do not usually care about that since I do not like fragrance, but it smelled like really old, rancid crayons.  The balm did okay to remove makeup, but it was unreasonably hard to wash off and left a film on my face.  I double cleanse regardless, but felt this almost needed a third cleanse since the second was just to wash off this product.  Appreciate the reasonable price point, but will not purchase or recommend mainly due to the filmy residue it leaves, and also the smell."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Singapore,Not needed,"This product can get a little sticky and makes the packaging feels icky as well. Does absolutely nothing to the skin, doesnt make it better but worsens my breakouts. "
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,Jodie,My far my favourite product from the inkey list. This is my second purchase of this balm as I use it everyday as my first cleanse before I go in with my normal cleanser. I love it because it removes mascara without irritating my eyes and feels lovely and hydrating. I also love that it can be used as a mask too.
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,oily residue ,"it does the job but leaves an oily residue on the skin which need a cleanser just yo remove it..then only I can cleanse my face as usual..so it is a bit of a hassle for me..also, it does not remove heavy though"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,go to cleansing balm ,"My go to cleansing balm, it removes all my makeup/sunscreen and is an affordable price compared to other cleansing balms. I always stock up on this when purchasing. "
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,love it! ,Absolutely love the oat cleansing balm. Definitely does the job at melting the makeup off and easy to clean after. And little goes a long way. Would buy again! 
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,oat cleansing balm ,"Best cleansing balm I have used totally recommend it feel so soothing on the face and once you rinse it off it makes your skin so smooth and great price for a cleansing balm. I also recommend their other products as well.
"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,New favorite!,Absolutely love this product for a quick refresh after a night out or a day at work. Takes off all stubborn make up in a blink. I have occasional ￼ eczema on my eyelid which was not irritated at all! Love it
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,repurchased,I have used it once and have purchased again. This is the oil cleanser in the double cleanse routine every night. I have used Clinique cleansing balm and this is comparable in quality but so much better on the pocket! 
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,Review. ,The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm is another favourite of mine. It removes everything in seconds and doesn’t strip my skin. I love using it to remove makeup and also as a end of day pre cleanser. I have already made another purchase for another one!  
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,like,"It feels like putting vaseline on your face, and after rinsing, you still feel balmy so you do need to double cleanse for sure. The good thing is it takes makeup really well including mascaras that are difficult to remove, and for the price, it is cheap since you dont need a lot for each time."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,cleansing balm,"Love this product so much, you get so much just for the price of $15!!! Melts makeup straight away, use before i go in with my water-based cleanser, it is defiently worth it in my opinion"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,LOVEEEE,"my favorite cleanser, melts my makeup right off and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Singapore,Cheap & effective!,"This cleansing balm is so convenient - a lot of these come in a tub and is so troublesome to scoop out especially when you’re in the shower. With this tube form, it is more hygienic and easy to just squeeze out and use! I use this at the end of the day to remove my sunscreen from my skin before using my cleanser for effective cleaning."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,Great Cleanser,"This is a great cleanser. It feels thick and rich. Even though it does feel quite heavy on the skin it rinses easily off and leaves the skin feeling clean and comfortable with no residue. After some warmer weather the product separated a little but a quick shake resolved that (or you could mix it on your hand) but it didn’t change its function, purpose or outcome. "
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,Oat Cleansing Balm ,"i rr purchased the inkey list Oat Cleansing balm twice, I use this Cleansing balm as make-up remover and as first cleanser in my night routine. after this I use another cleanser to deeply clean my skin. "
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Love it.,"I use this as a first step in my double cleansing routine. I can't imagine just using this as a solo cleanser because of how greasy it kind of feels (and I didn't know that other people use it as solo cleansers). But, this is pretty good as a cleansing balm and definitely comes off easily when you're double cleansing with a regular cleanser afterwards. You get a lot of product for such a small price and it does a great job getting your makeup off."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Leaves thick film on my face,"I can't express how much I hate this formula. Maybe if your skin is like super super dry, this might be good, but it doesn't wash off. It leaves a thick film on my face that feels greasy and awful. Luckily, it does wash off when I use a regular cleanser after, but I could NEVER use just this alone."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Holy grail of affordable cleansing balms,"Amazing affordable first cleanse balm. Melts any makeup off gently, leaves skin feeling soft and soothed. There's a bit of oily residue and occasional scratchy granules, but for the price it's forgiving."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,best product ever,"The best oil based cleanser.. I keep repurchasing..gentle to skin, can be used as mask.very nice texture. I always buy to as is usually sold out.can’t recommend enough "
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,love this ,I love how thick this balm is. My go-to especially for the price. There are nicer formulas out there but this is value for money and does the job properly. 
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,New Zealand,Great Cleansing Balm,"This is the only cleansing balm that I will ever use, I have super sensitive eyes and this one doesn't seem to irritate them as much. Also love the texture and it leaves the skin feeling soft and clean after your first cleanse. "
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,😍😍😍😍,It took off my most waterproof makeup and there’s a lot in 5 oz I was so impressed!!
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Not for me,"I am not a person who fears oils, but this is too much for me!  It does separate, which isn’t so bad because you’re going to rub it in anyway, but it leaves a thick film even after a lot of rinsing.  It is unscented, so there is just nothing nice about the experience except that it comes in a tube.  I wish more cleansing balms would. I guess it does break up makeup and sunscreen.iiunscientific"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,great product,"Love the formula for this product but the packaging makes it very difficult to use. Because of the nature of the product with it being a balm, it is very hard to get out of the tube. "
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,Good for non-waterproof makeup ,"this is great if you have sensitive skin and don't wear a lot of makeup, or to help remove sunscreen, but it doesn't help remove waterproof mascara which is a deal breaker for me. if not for that I would repurchase "
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Double cleanses have my heart,"This product feel great on my skin. Works really well with a double cleanse use this first, than a gel based cleanser and your skin will be left so soft. Does a great job at removing makeup! Not harsh at all."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,Just No,Product separated in the tube and was completely unusable. I’m a great lover of oil & balm cleansers this has to be the worst one I’ve tried. Hoping I got a bad one but would not try again.
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,overall good,"This is overall a good product but shouldnt be used solely as a cleanser, its only good as a first step cleanser to remove makeup, dirt, etc. it should be then followed up by a proper cleanser that removes everything, otherwise its a great cleansing balm for the price"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,A must have!,This is such a staple in my routine! It literally melts off my makeup and doesn’t strip my face from any natural oils at all! I use it to double cleanse so it’s my first step and then I go with a second cleanser
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm - 150ml (Original),The Oat Cleansing Balm is my go to for removing my makeup. The oily feel melts my makeup off and is a really good cheaper alternative compared to other products.
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,New Zealand,Great cleanser,"This reminds me of a overpriced vaseline.. and to be honest I’m not mad at it, but I’m not sure if I would purchase again. It’s not irritating at all. And it has really gentle ingredients. I like that you can use it as a mask to soften skin."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,great makeup remover,"I usually opt for an oil cleanser but my usual was out of stock when I bought this. This cleansing balm beautifully removes most makeup, however doesn’t remove all"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,doesn't remove anything,"I feel bad for giving this a bad review butttttttt it's trash. One, the thickness of the balm makes it really hard to squeeze out - maybe I'm just weak but man I struggle. Two, it says you only need a small amount but you need a lot. It'll remove foundation and cream OK (but what doesn't?) but goodluck removing your mascara and eye-liner. It doesn't make my skin feel good. Spend the same amount of money on the Heimish Balm."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,Oat Cleansing Balm,I want to try this products for double cleansing. I'm using with other The Inkey List cleanser product. Not really like the texture. I feel my eyes hurt.  Not too clean up my makeup. Need to used wet tissues also. 😅 
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,YES,"Wonderful. If you prefer double cleansing by using an oil first, this product may be too oily for you. I find it very hydrating yet cleansing and will definitely repurchase. Feels similar to Biossance cleansing balm but with added beads."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,YES,"My favorite cleanser ever. I've gone through so many bottles of this stuff. Removes makeup like a dream, and it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin or dry it out. Also leaves my skin feeling silky smooth. People saying that it doesn't lather... IT'S BECAUSE IT'S A BALM. It's not suppose to lather..."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,best makeup remover!,"When I first tried this product i was surprised at how well it removed my makeup, didn’t break me out and made my skin feel amazing. Recommend for all skin types forever my favorite.
"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Canada,The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm - 150ml (Original),"Horrible cleanser. It has a weird smell (almost like cheap kid makeup smell), does not lather well, and leaves a weird film/slimy feeling on the face. My skin does not feel cleansed at all after using this product. Not sure if others with really sensitive skin would have a better experience with this product."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Will finish product but not buy again,Would not purchase again as a cleansing oil it works but leaves a film that needs to be double cleansed
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Make-up Easliy Removed,I love this product! I wear A TON of make up for my stage performances and after hours of touch ups and sweating I can wash everything away. There is no need to scrub your skin and it doesn’t feel extremely heavy either.
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,New Zealand,Oat Cleansing Balm,"Lux, Thick Balm that breaks down easily when warm a little goes a long way. Fantastic for the price and removes makeup easily while leaving your skin soft afterwards "
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,BUY IT,It’s amazing . takes of all my makeup easily and doesn’t dry my face out after . the oats make your face feel soft after. A lot of product especially  for price.
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Terrible Compared to The Ordinary Squaline Cleanse,"I've always used The Ordinaty Squaline Cleanser as my first cleanse to break down my makeup. I loved it but wanted to try something new and this oat cleansing balm was much cheaper per ounce. I've tried it twice to give it a fair shot and was very hopeful because I like many of the inkey list products. This oat cleansing balm is gritty (hurts to rub on my eyes and sensitive skin), hard to squeeze out of the bottle (too thick for such a tiny nozzle), and did not break down my eye makeup well (especially my mascara which isn't even water proof). After double cleansing I still had makeup left around my eyes. I've never written a review on here and have never returned a sephora product but I will be returning this tomorrow. I'm so disappointed. If you're debating between this and The Ordinary, definitely go with The Ordinary!"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,A staple in my routine,I use this as a first cleanse to take off sunscreen and makeup from the day and I love it. Already on my third bottle. Does leave residue but comes right off with the second cleanse.
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,Go To affordable cleansing balm,"Easy repurchase. Whilst the smell can be off putting to some, the balm works so well and feels great on the skin. Leaves my skin feeling hydrated and not stripped "
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Not great for me,"Not great, leaves too much residue. Doesn’t even really melt your makeup off like I’d expect for a balm. Not a fan of the grit either. Otherwise very mild, probably good for super dry sensitive skin that doesnt wear makeup."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Similar to Farmacy scentless cleansing balm,This cleansing balm is great! Good price for how much product you get.
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,Cleansing Balm,"I love this to take off my makeup and sunscreen that I wore in the day. The texture and scent is very natural. If you want a more clarifying balm, this is not the one. Great if you have sensitive or dry skin."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,Best Product For Double Cleansing (Budget Friendly!!),"My all-time favourite oil cleansing. I always incorporate my double cleanse routine with The Inkey List’s Oat Cleansing Balm. I have extremely dry skin and this product never stripped my skin off, it does the job removing all of the impurities and leftover sunscreen on my face. If you are on a budget, you can definitely give this a go!"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,"Wonderful, Gentle Cleanser","I have started double cleansing, and use this product before my other face wash. I really love how well the product removes makeup and sunscreen and I have already noticed a difference with clearer skin. The consistency is a little odd, obviously it doesn’t really lather well, and you do have to be careful when washing any eye makeup off. Overall it is a great product, especially for the price. It is gentle, moisturizing and a great step in my routine."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Good product but not for me,"I used it in my double cleansing routine together with caudalie vinopure cleanser. Honestly, it's too oily for me. It removes makeup not so bad, it does its job. But leaves a very oily feeling on my skin afterwards, my hands are going for the next cleanser immediately. I won't buy it again, want to try something less oily."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,Bish is thick.,"I've only been using this for a week and I'm still on the fence. I've only had oil cleansers so the balm is something I'm not used to. It's great at getting makeup off, however rinsing it off can be a challenge. "
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,sensitive skin loves this ,every cleanser I’ve used has broken me out im so lucky to have come across this amazing AFFORDABLE cleanser. I double cleanse using the same product! it’s great for removing makeup as well. my skin hasn’t been irritated by this and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and supple and glowy (something that’s unheard of for my sensitive dry skin) my sister has used this with very oily skin and she loves it as well a very dynamic product. I love the inkeylist so much. 
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Good,"Affordable, sustainable and works well. I suggest shaking it before using so the product doesn’t separate. The only bad thing is that it is not recommended to use on your eyes, it may cause irritation"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Don’t waste your money,The worst for make-up removal. Does not work at all!
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Singapore,nice cleansing balm,"It is a nice cleansing balm to remove makeup. It removes makeup thoroughly and doesn't dry out skin. It is olily balm in texture that it moves smoothly on the face, however it is easy to rinse off and doesn't leave greasy feeling. "
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Good product but not my favorite,I’ve used this product for about a week now and I will say that it works but not my favorite. It removed my sunscreen/makeup with ease so I would recommend it for a price effective cleansing balm. My only issues are the smell. Reminds me of Playdough and I feel like an oil film is left on my skin which is unpleasant. Overall a good product but I won’t be repurchasing.
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,"Eh, better off using korean/japanese cleansing oil",It leaves a film on your face even after you washed with water. I always double cleanse so it’s not really a problem for me but there are way better and cheaper options. The Kose Softymo is great.
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Will be a staple in my routine!,"This is my second purchase, I love this product for so many reasons: (1) The price (2) Its a squeeze bottle, I leave this in the shower and I don’t have to unscrew the cover which can cause a mess for me (3) It emulsifies. Idon’t nicelynicely."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm - 150ml (Original),"I've used up two bottles of these, and there are better ones out there. It's cheap and get's the job done. It's also great for people who have dry skin or may be sensitive. However, it's a finicky product. If you live in a humid or hot climate, the product can be gloopy and melts a bit. With the packaging, I find that if I open it and I'm not careful, straight-up cleansing oil will drip out. This should come in a tub instead. Another reason I'm not a complete fan is because it can leave a slight residue on the skin. You would need to double cleanse with another cleanser. It's good for what it is, but if I ran out, I would go to a different cleansing balm."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,The Inkey List - Oat Cleansing balm,"Love this product! It is quite oily, and you do need to give the product a good shake before you use it all the time. However this just melts all my makeup off, it even gets off waterproof mascara and eyeliner. 
I recommending using it with a facial pad as it gets off there remaining oil"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,THE BEST,"this removes makeup, sunscreen, dirts and oils in seconds! leaves your skin so smooth and hydrated. i never use makeup wipes anymore because these remove everything so much better and are so good for the environment!"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,excellent makeup remover!,"I love this cleanser so much- it's by far my favorite makeup remover. it smells so good and does an amazing job removing my makeup (even mascara). I always double cleanse and use this one as a first step, so I can't related to what the other comments were saying. however, I will note that unlike other makeup removers, you definitely need to add water first in order to take off your makeup"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,MY HOLY GRAILLLLL,I HAVE GONE THROUGH LIKE 3 BOTTLES OF THIS. ITS SO GOOD.
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Love it!,This balm is so affordable and smells really good! I'm obsessed!
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,Only good to super dry skin,This cleansing balm good for super dry skin or I only use it to cold weather season or country. Otherwise I feel it is to heavy and oily on my skin. Anyway it is good but only personally suitable at certain temperature
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,Australia,Understandably hyped,"At first I didn’t like this cleansing balm due to the sticky feeling left behind on my skin but after giving it another go, I’ve definitely changed my mind. This cleanser is perfect for people with dry skin like myself. "
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm - 150ml (Original),amazing product. one of the best oil cleansers I've ever used and for this price it's a must have!
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,"It’s alright, does the job.","It’s just fine, it’s not a holy grail and it’s not terrible. It gets the job done of removing all my makeup. BUT it is gentle on the skin and doesn’t clog pores or cause any new breakouts. So, I do appreciate that about it. Probably won’t repurchase if I’m being completely honest. I just don’t completely love it, there’s nothing wrong with the actual product."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Required for haunt season!,"I work in a haunted house and we use a variety of special fx makeup and adhesives. Things like liquid latex, spirit gum, grease make up, lots of fake bloods and alcohol paint. I also suffer from adult acne so I wanted to make sure it would remove EVERYTHING gently. works like a charm. Apply, let sit for a couple minutes, then rub it in with wet hands. Now I do wipe off with a cloth before my 2nd cleanse. It was even mild enough to remove the makeup from my fever blister (hereditary unfortunately) without discomfort! I've recommended it to all the actors now. LOVE IT! My second pic is before wiping it off."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,The best oil base cleanser,"I looooove this product! This is my forth time using this and I just love this! it melts the foundation and everything on my face. I use this, and then my salysilic or hyaluronic cleanser from the inkey list and everytime I feel my face clean and amazing!"
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,"Will not be repurchasing, recommending or reusing.","This was one of the worse make up removers I have ever tried. Left all of my makeup on my face, has a nasty residue, and smells odd. I threw away the bottle after a handful of tries."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,New Zealand,film,leaves a film that’s hard to wash off
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,Buy something else,"Yeah, I suppose you could say this is a hydrating face wash. Oily is another term. It doesn’t get all my eye make up off, which is annoying; I only wear mascara. I like the brand and wanted to like this face wash, but I’ve used half the tube and am still disappointed. I would never buy this again."
THE INKEY LIST-Oat Cleansing Balm,USA,"Awful, skip,","Probably the worst oil cleanser I’ve ever used. It feels like it’s one step above using pure coconut oil, however it didn’t clog my pores. Will not be repurchasing. Bummer:("
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,fav!,My fav cleanser. Love the texture of course also the smell not too strong. It make my face feel smooth after use. Definitely will buy again next time.

SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,Everyday cleanser,"My favourite cleanser for all time. Gentle for your skin in removing oil, dirt and light makeup. Leaves your skin smooth and supple every each time. Nice rose sent but not overwhelming. "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,Love,"I love this cleanser. Actually the first time I tried this on 2014. But, my skin felt dried and itchy after use. But after 4 years, I tried it again and my skin feels very soft. Now become my everyday cleanser day and night! "

SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,deep cleans ,"
Being using SK-II product over 10 years.. definitely worth even the price keep increasing.. I love the soft textured of the product and little bubbling whenever you used it.. deep cleansing and more importantly keep my skin tighten, clean, hydrating and fresh.. "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,crazy expensive but good,"good cleanser but can be drying for dry skin. if you have oily skin, you would like this. a tiny bit will give you a good amount of foam. so the entire tube will last you quite long. minus a star because the price is crazy expensive!"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,maybe not for dry skin,"I've got combi skin with drier skin on the surface and glands that produce lots of oil on my T zone so i thought this cleanser would be good since it claims to be gentle but after washing, my skin feels abit tight. I won't say it's very uncomfortable, after doing my skincare routine the tightness will be gone so i guess the cleanser is abit drying but my skin definitely felt cleansed"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,expensive but worth it ,"I have used this product for more than 3 yrs and love it. Start from this product, I have used other SK II skin care set too. I wish SK II might have night cream too. "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,first time try,"this is my first time to try this brand cleanser, so far it feels good, my face feel very moist after I use it does not dry, unlike other brand I feel my face it’s very tight after I use , I think I will keep using this
"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,Ms,"I used SKII since 2017 whole set including their essence, toner and moisturizer. This the best cleanser i ever had so far. Can used up to 1 year. Not drying your skin and skin look more fresh and brighten. "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,works wonder to my skin,"I tend to shy away from skin-whitening products 
cause it doesn’t sit well with my sensitive skin. But for the sake of this SK-II review, I stuck my neck out and tried SK-II’s Cleanser which is made with Japanese plum extract, a fruit known for its antioxidant and anti-glycation properties. Antioxidants are also great for sensitive skin like mine, because they help to protect it against free radicals that can damage skin cells and cause inflammation."
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,Repurchase ,Been using this cleanser for years and never fails to make my face clean and soft all the time. Never regret trying out this brand even though its at a more expensive side of skincare line. 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,Perfect,"I've tried many cleanser to find the perfect one, SK-II... My skin glow and radiance after a few use. It removes make up pretty good. I don't think I could ever live without this!"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,Good,"I’ve stop using this brand cleanser for almost 4 years and recently I switch back again. I still find the cleanser very foamy and able to cleanse very well. Although it is expensive, but I think I will continue to use it."
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,good cleanser but annoying packaging,"It’s a really normal cleanser and I’d like to believe that this is making my skin condition better. However, the packaging is just not it. Why are they still using this twist cap?? Water got into the tube accidentally during shower and screwed up the product inside. Now I’m squeezing watery bubbles out of my tube. Cap is slippery too, hate unscrewing and screwing the cap during shower. Wish they could chnage the packaging to be more user friendly "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,ok,"not worth the price - fresh has a much better product 
the smell is stronger but not necessarily a good thing for your skin. also too creamy maybe better for sensitive skin that needs something richer - but it’s not refreshing for me 
"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,love it!,"Super moisturising cleanser. Doesn’t leave the skin dry and tight after every wash. Leaves the skin feeling so smooth too. I have combination sensitive skin and it works wonders 
"

SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,Favourite!,"Using this as a daily cleanser, the formula is very very gentle, you may notice the pitera 'scent' but it is not as overwhelming as the essence scent but it is noticeable enough. Will repurchase this. "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,Perfect.,"The only facial wash which does not give me irritation and sting my face. Perfect most of the time but sometimes a tiny bit drying, so have to pair it with the treatment essence. Price might throw you off but you only need a tiny bit each wash so one big tube may last for months. "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,Pricey but worth it!,"Yes, it is quiet pricey for a cleanser. But it is worth it...at least for me. The cleanser cleans the skin very well n the skin is very softs after wash. Really love it!"

SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,The Best Facial Wash,"I have a super dry skin and this facial wash is so gentle, it does not suck up the moisture out of my skin and at the same time removing most of the dirt on my skin. I felt fresh after using it without any strecthy sensation. This facial wash has subtle rose smell, not overwhelmed but just give some sort of spa feeling comfort. To be honest, this facial wash is balance, not creamy and not foamy. Normally, dry skin facial wash is too creamy and will always felt like our skin is still not clean. Worth the penny."
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,manufacture date a bit old,"Tried this from the pitera mini set and fell in love instantly. However, quite disappointed to find out the manufactured date was in March 2019 (used the cosmetic calculator to check as they don’t print the date anywhere on the product). I know a product can last up to 3 years but this leave to only 8 months left for me to use. Hopefully it’s still efficient "

SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,average cleanser for the price point,"Good for someone with oily skin since it can be stripping to a drier skin type. Despite the creamy texture, it will leave your skin a bit tight after cleansing. Not the most favorable smelling cleanser. "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,best one,"I used  this cleanser since last month, try to change to another cleanser because of the price, but at the end i came back to this one. It smooth my skin , make it glow , at it doesnot make my skin dryvor break out. "

SK-II-Facial Treatment Gentle Cleanser,Philippines,Ms.,A little goes a long way! With just a pea size it cleanses my entire face.

DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,suitable for my skin,this was my go to product since the kate s. was discontinued at sephora. dr.jart gave me good results at a lower price range and i’m so glad i tried this brand and now still continue to use it and i think it will be for life. only thing i dont like is that the big tube doesn’t have a pointed nuzzle so sometimes i squeeze a lot but little amount of cleanser really goes a long way so i always purchase the 30ml bec of the pointed nuzzle
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Philippines,Love Dr. Jart,I’ve been using this product for 4 years now. It doesn’t make my skin dry and everytime after i wash my face it always feels squeeky clean. I also love the smell and that you only need a small amount and it lathers straight into a foam when you add a little water. 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Not bad at all!,"Skin does feel clean, although not the soap squeaky kinda clean. Which is good, because the skin doesn't feel like it's being stripped of moisture. Basically it does its job well."

DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,skin feels so clean,"The first time i tried, i put quite generous amount of the cream on my hands, when i put it on my face it’s actually a lot and makes my skin quite tight. I reduce the amount the next day, only small dot on my palm and yeah feels better. Did not expect to be satisfied with the cleanser. It is quite thick so only need to use small amount. Good value for money. "

DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,One of my favourite ‘atas’ cleansers,"When looking through all the facial cleansers on Sephora, i’ve tried the top rated few.

DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,ok,bought the small one previously. felt ok so decided to get the big one during sales. not sure if it will be ok too. yet to try. this min 150character review is irritating too
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,stay away,"This was drying and stripping. I dont even have dry skin. If you have dry or sensitive skin, use fresh soy cleanser or cetaphil. This wasnt worth it. Dont buy. "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,small,a very small bottle. bought this to try before committing to the big bottle. soft and gentle on the skin. i have dry and sensitive skin so would repurchase again 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,love dr jart,"I love dr jart product so this is just another good product that i use from their line. It leaves my skin soft and clean after washing. I just dont know why the plastic box packaging is so huge, abit unnecessary "

DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Philippines,enjoyable product,"It doesn’t feel stripping which i like but also feels like you’ve got a clean face after.

Note:  I didnt enjoy it initially because i used it the wrong way. The proper way is to foam it in your hands before you apply it on your face, take note ladies! <3 "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Nice and long lasting simple product,I've been repurchasing this and buying my 4th now. Skin feels clean after use but not drying. A little bit of product goes a long way. Value for money as 1 bottle lasts me ~6 months.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Recommended ,I love to use this product with my foreo… bought the smaller size to try out and it is good!! So I am now purchasing second times for the bigger size…
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,regular cleanser,"not irritating, skin feels good after wash without any tightening sensation. nice smell and does its job to remove excess oil and dirt from the skin. a bit on the pricey side"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Amazing ,"Bought to meet free shipping hehe good pick. It is very gentle, face feels clean and moisturized after using, not those squeaky clean tight feeling. Bought a full size after."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Good cleanser,Overall a good cleanser to use as it is foamy yet doesn't make the skin feels dry. Will purchase again in the future.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,love it!,"I just loveeeeeee this cleanser so much!! Foam it up and cleanse your face! Affordable, light on the skin and gets the job done. Plus it’s affordable!!!"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Okay,"The application experience is quite nice. It comes out of the tube as a gel, but becomes a foamy lather as you work it in. Your face definitely feels cleaner after a wash, but it's a little more stripping for my combo skin leaving it a little tight. Don't think I'll be repurchasing this.

"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Average,A really average cleanser … doesn’t lather up too much … totally replaceable with something more affordable from the drugstore like cerave or cetaphil 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,TQ sephora,"omg... I really like it... shipping fast, item good condition, price good.. I will buy again for next collection.. please make price sale again...tq Sephora 🥰"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,great,love how this is a foam cleanser but does not feel that squeaky tight feeling after. a very pleasant cleanser i would say. the price point is affordable too so i would definitely repeat this cleanser 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,REMARKABLE CLEANSER,"Although I don hv much problem with my face but recently pops up lotsa pimples due to wearing mask and humid weather. I use Japanese brand before but I'm thinking to change a new brand, not knowing this brand before but jz gv it a try. I guess my skin back to normal aft using it.. a small dot can wash my whole face.Unbelievable.. 😉"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,ok ,"Not a bad cleanser for it’s price point, I like the slight exfoliating effect it provides without being too drying. Probably would purchase again, but only for travels "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Philippines,Good for its price,"Although this product has a pleasant scent, I experienced breakouts within the first week of using it. It is non-drying and will leave your skin feeling clean and not sticky after application. It's also reasonably priced and a good size for trying it out first."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Good,I've tried this cleanser before and it is suitable for sensitive skin. it doesnt dry out your skin and your face feel smooth after using it. definitely worth the money
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,2nd cleanser ,Tried the traveling size fall in love with it. Suitable as for second cleansing step . It’s gentle to the skin and have don’t have to use a lot to form bubbles. 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Philippines,Better for normal-to-dry skin,"I really wanted to love this, but unfortunately, it didn't work for me. It cleansed well and didn't cause allergies or pimples, BUT it left a film that might be better for normal-to-dry skin types. As I have oily skin, it made me feel greasier. The other issue is it's too expensive for the amount. If you have acne-prone, oily, sensitive skin, and price isn't too much of an issue for you, consider First Aid or Galinee instead. "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Love it,I lost count of how many times I did purchase this cleanser. I love it does not make my skin feeling very tight after cleanser and it does not breakout my skin. Totally worth it. Not sure whether this product is animal cruelty free.. hope it is not. 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,dries your skin,Claims to be hydrating and moisturising but no way that’s true! Used this for a week and it dried my skin so much I never touched it again. However my friend with combination skin uses this and it seems to work just fine 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Love it!,"I love this dr jart cleanser, it really leave my skin smooth and felt really clean. Absolutely will buy again. Loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ittttttttttttt"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Philippines,nothing special ,"I love Dr Jart products and I’ve tried almost all their skincare lines so I wanted to try out their facial cleanser as well. Unfortunately unlike their serums and creams, there’s really nothing special about this cleanser. I think other brands in a lower price point can work just as well. It is also a bit drying so I wouldn’t recommend it to those with dry skin. "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,dr jart cleanser,I have not used this product but I heard so much good reviews about it!  I cannot wait to use it and if it’s good I will buy it in replacement of my Nuskin cleanser. Both are foam cleanser 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,love it,"I have very sensitive skin, and this cleanser doesn't irritate me at all. It will remove light makeup, but waterproof makeup will require a makeup remover first. The attractive price drew me in as well. "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Philippines,Amazing to my skin,"On first use it really is gentle and makes my skin supple, balance, no breakouts at all. I was using some face soap for sometime and drying my skin and I really need a change of cleanser. I am not even keen on using moisturizers on my face but this cleanser keeps my skin neutral, moisturize. I am satisfied and happy  with this cleanser. It really cleans without any sting, it kinds of heal my skin. "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,good cleanser,A good cleanser that foams well. Non stripping and doesnt strip the skin. Skin feels good and soft after cleansing. Will repurchase and yes good and great
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Philippines,surprisingly good!,"Not fungal acne safe (sadly) but it's gentle enough not to cause flare ups. Remind sme of Purito's Defense Barrier PH cleanser and Cosrx's good morning cleanser. It's a good alternative for Fresh's gel cleanser if you don't like fragrant cleansers. 
"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,love it,"Regret not getting the big size one. It’s really good, cleanse well and smells good. Will definitely get the big size after this. Not exactly cheap option but worth the price"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Love love love,Bought Dr Jart  face cleanser/product for the first time after watched the review from YouTuber and now this is my new face cleanser. Going to try other product from this brand 🤘🏻
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Good and Easy,"Lovely product, nice scent, cleans well, does not irritate skin, price is not bad, clear gel formula - what else do you need?"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Gel-like,"It creates a foam like texture which is what I was looking for. However it can be slightly too drying/ stripe off texture after washing …..
 Smell is moderate
 
"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,good,My boyfriend everyday facial cleanser. Bought it like 5th time now already. He has dry sensitive skin. Cleanse without over drying. Will repurchase again and again. 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Mild and friendly cleanser,"Not bad for a mild cleanser, since okay for me. It does not feel tight or too dry after using it, and I am a dry skin type. Worth to try if you want to try a mild cleanser."

DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,refreshing cleanser,"refreshing cleanser that delivers what it promises. it’s fuss free and straightforward but nothing amazing. does not overly strip skin of moisture, suitable for daily use
"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Micro PH foam Cleanser,"This one with lemon smell , and refreshing I feel clean after just one use , I will purchased full sized once I finish my current travel size 30ml one.                               "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Good for travel ,"This cleanser is good to carry around when you travel. However, I find it finishes really quickly and a tube only last me for about a month which is rather quick for a cleanser. I wash my face 2 times a day. "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,dr jart+,Ive been using this cleanser since early 2020 and this has been the best cleanser out of all for me. Definitely a holy grail. My skin type is dry and ive been looking for cleanser that suit me. Been trying on so many brands before and this has to be the one.

DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,clean,"I like how it feels after washing my face with this product. It feels clean and fresh. But not gonna lie, after using this product there are some acne problems "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,normal & overpriced,feels like any other regular face wash. it's not drying to the skin but does not feel any different from other brands. feels overpriced for the amount bought 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Best cleanser ever !,I find myself coming back to this cleanser even after trying out plenty of the other good ones out there. This cleanser is literally the best for sensitive and combo skin!
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,light and clean,this product is light and a little goes a long way. i like when it foams up and def makes my face feel clean. small size to try but will prob purchase the full one
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Great,I love this so much! My skin feels super clean and smooth after I use this cleanser. Worth the purchase! Interested to see how it would affect my face in a few weeks
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Philippines,excellent cleanser,I love this because it lathers beautifully and you get that clean skin feeling after without feeling dry or tightness on the skin. I would get the bigger one next time. 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Good cleanser,this is a good product for cleanser. it doesn't give the tight feeling after washing face. I use this as my 2nd cleansing step for double cleanse routine. it does has citrus fragrance almost like orange. it doesn't irritate my skin. 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro pH Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,amazing,"I bought a lot of it, it works well on my eczema skin and doesn’t cause any breakouts or dryness! It’s inexpensive too as compared to the other facial products that I try and doesn’t work "
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,Favourite face wash - but cap keeps breaking,"By far my favourite face wash. My husband loves it too and only uses this face wash. HOWEVER, please please do something about the packaging. The hinge of the cap keeps breaking (2 bottles, 2 times in a row now). It seems like it's 'lightly attached' and with frequent opening/closing, the hinge breaks."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Wonderful Cleanser,"Great cleanser! I have pale sensitive skin and this makes it fell wonderful. Its gentle, doesn't smell, rinses easily. Just a great everyday cleanser exfoliant. Try it, you will love it!"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Malaysia,okay okay,Not too bad not too okay . The couple of month I’m using this cleanser i dont see much improvement on my skin . Its just make my skin refresh and not get rid of my texture skin as they mention . 
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Singapore,love the rice wash cleanser ,It is Light and comfortable on every wash! Love the light scent and I bought the primer too! It is totally amazing on the skin! Will recommend it others! 
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Great for Dry Skin! Worth the Price,"This face wash has been super awesome for my skin! I originally received a sample of this in my birthday gift and I got hooked. I have combo skin, but during the winter my skin gets super dry and flaky. This wash is helps moisturize my skin and doesn't leave me feeling all dried out afterwords. I know a lot of people have issues with the slightly gritty texture of the face wash, but I actually love it. Its super gentle on my skin and helps exfoliate. You also don't need to use much of this at a time. I use about a pea sized drop each wash."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Singapore,awesome ,one of the best buy for cleanser. no tightness feel washing my face. it will buy again when there is a discount and to try out other products with this brand 
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,You must try it !,"I love this cleanser. It is very concentrated and a little bit goes a long way and foams super well. It leaves my skin feeling soft and supple. However, Tatcha needs to work on the packaging. The lid broke off quickly."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser - 120ml,"Was looking for an alternative to a Korean foaming rice wash cleanser, but I didn't expect that this cleanser was bit more of an exfoliating type. It is important to note (specially to people with extra sensitive skin) that it has microbeads in it that dissolves after a while. All in all, does the job ok as a cleanser, but might not repurchase cause of the microbeads) and will look specifically for gentle foaming cleansers instead."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser - 120ml,"I don’t know what happened with my skin and this cleanser but really wasn’t good for my skin. This cleanser has been causing my skin to break out for weeks now, and in places I’ve never had breakouts before. My skin is extremely dry and acne prone so if you have similar skin, this may not be for you."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,So good but out of my budget,"I got this for the birthday gift and wish I didn't like it so much because of the price. It feels so nice on the skin, instantly brightens and makes me look glowy without a chemical exfoliant. It also helps tone down my acne redness"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,One of the best,I have been using this cleanser for a few weeks and honestly it's one of the best I ever tried. It was one of the birthday gifts. It's hard to find a product that thoroughly removes makeup. This one desolves foundation and mascara as well. The birthday sample also contained a moisturizer which is amazing. Love it Tatcha!
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,"Clean, great product that feels good on your skin",I love love love love this cleanser. It is nourishing and gentle
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Singapore,Excellent cleanser,Very effective.  It also removes leftover makeup without stripping the skin. Leaves the skin quote soft. I find the cream format better than gel cleansers and the slight grain in the formula feels like a soft exfoliant 
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Great!,"Pleasantly surprised.   This is a great cleanser, not drying and removes full face of makeup."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser - 120ml,"It's good, but not the best. It doesn't really foam at all, but my face does feel cleaner and softer after using it."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Singapore,new exfoliate ,micro beads feel comfort to the skin. use it as a part of my exfoliate routine like 2-3 times a week. the smell nice tho not too strong. the feeling after is soft and gentle on my skin
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Singapore,"great product, terrible bottle ","Love this cleanser, a very gentle exfoliating and not drying daily cleanser that smells pleasant. One downside is the bottle cap that breaks on first use. It happens to literally everyone it’s such a joke, other than that the product itself is great! "
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser - 120ml,"this had a weird grainy texture to it, it left my face somewhat hydrated but it didn’t feel like it really cleaned my face that well. this actually irritated my skin a bit so i ended up returning it."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Really good; Review from a Tatcha Skeptic,"This wash feels extraordinary and you really have to compliment tatcha for the formulation here if nothing else. There is a mild ""grit"" to the cleanser when it first comes out of the tube which immediately dissolves as you rub your hands together and spread it over your face. It never creates a harsh lather, but rather cleans your skin almost like an balm or an oil, easily removing dirt and oil from your pores. It feels very rich never leaves you dry. 

I think this would probably work for all skin types with exception to extremely oily skin. If you've got very oily skin or clogged pores, I recommend the Hyper Skin Gentle Brightening Gel, which is my favorite cleanser at the moment for reducing the look of pores. This Tatcha rice wash comes in second place, as it's super calming and I always reach for this when I want a cleanser to make me feel like I'm at a spa. 

Be aware that their is some mild fragrance. This really shouldn't cause any issues even on sensitive skin, BUT as always if you have a damaged skin barrier from going too hard on the chemical exfoliates or treatments (can look like small red patches or general stinging when applying products) then I would put down all fragrance products until your skin heals."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,I LOVE THIS!,"This is an amazing face wash! So far I absolutely love everything from this company. This face wash has a thick and creamy/pasty consistency when first coming out of the tube, but from just a small pea-sized amount, it really lathers up extremely well and covers the entire face. So a small amount really goes a long way with this product. Not only that, this face wash also feels extremely silky-smooth upon the face! It is literally like washing your face in liquid-silk! I love this face wash so much!"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Would give 0 stars if I could,Horrendous! Never broke out as much as I did from this product.
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Amazing,I got a small one in an etsy bag. I absolutely love it. I just ordered the normal size. I have super sensitive skin especially under my eyes above the cheek bone area and acne prone skin. Salicylic acid cleansers burn my under eye areas so badly. This product has helped my acne and doesn’t irritate my under eyes.
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,A++,Love this. Will definitely repurchase. Use it as second step in cleansing.
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,"Fresh, Clean and Smooth",This is one of my favorite cleansers in my skin care line up! It leaves my acne prone skin feeling fresh and clean. Super gentle and the added light exfoliation leave your skin nice and smooth. Love!
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser - 120ml,"I received a sample size of the rice wash and after only a few uses I think I might have to buy a whole bottle. After adding a little water, it suds up over the skin very nicely and feels so soft! I wasn’t expecting it to be so gentle. I’m rationing the remaining product for now, but can see myself using it daily with no issue."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Singapore,Good,"I have sensitive skin and my t-zone is oily. This cleanser works well on me. After cleansing, I notice that my face is brighter and doesn’t feel tight."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,YES YES YES,I have really dry and sensitive skin and let me tell you this cleanser is my new holy grail! I don’t have much acne just occasional here and there but a lot of redness and this cleared up my skin and took away the redness completely. Highly recommend!!!

TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Great cleanser,I love this cleanser!  It makes my skin feel soft and doesn't make me break out.
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Not for dry skin as advertised,"I tried the sample of this and loved it so I bought the bigger version. After using it for a couple days straight, it dried my skin out and made my pores way bigger than before. I have dry skin so I assumed this was going to hydrated my skin, but I got more dry patches instead."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,It’s a keeper,Amazing formula. Best cleanser I’ve used thus far. It’s luxurious and feels amazing on my skin.

TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Singapore,smells great and lux feel,"bought this after a trial pack as i really liked the way it leaves my face clean and smooth but not stripped of moisture. the foamy texture is also easy to wash off and great for dry skin. you only need half a pea sized amount each time so although pricey, I believe this tube will last me a long time!"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Not worth the hype,This product was highly disappointing. my face felt unclean after using and it caused some breakouts. I don't think it deserves the hype its ok at best.
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,The best for my dry skin!,"this cleanser is my go to, it has changed my dry flaky skin so much since I started using it! it smells amazing and leaves my face feeling so clean, nothing beats it! I follow up with my serums and the dewy moisturizer especially in the winter! the smell of tatchas products are absolutely heavenly!!"

TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,A must have,"After trying out so many face wash, I finally found the one that’s right for me.  This  rice wash is gentle on my face , and leaves a subtle smell that I love. My face never feels dry before putting my moisturizer on. Love the rice wash !"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,Best cleanser I’ve ever tried,Leaves my skin looking bright and feeling hydrated. Lovely scent and texture as well
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,New holy grail,I have been consistently using this along with a curology serum for 4 months. The serum alone did not completely clear my skin but this face wash did the trick. New holy grail!
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,Literal magic,After stopping birth control I’ve never had such bad break outs in my life. I’ve tried everything to control it and this product is the only thing that’s worked so far.
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,It's worth the try!,"I was in the market for a new cleanser for I believe that my current cleanser was not as effective as it had been. After a few uses of this cleanser, I saw immediately changes in my facial texture and tone. I am loving the results. This line is pricey but it is worth the try!"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,So far it’s magic !!,"I started to try this product during vacation. I have dry skin, but i tend to have blackheads on my nose since i’m a teenager. 
Within a few days of use (morning and night), I really saw a big difference ; I had less blackheards and my pores became smaller! I told myself that it could also be because I was nearby the sea and in a less polluted area. I’m back in the city since a week and so far the product is still doing its magic! I hope it will continue to help! 

I combine this with Glow receipe Toner."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Mixed Feelings,"I’m not sure what ingredient could be causing this reaction, but my skin can not tolerate it. I used the sample size. It feels great during the cleansing process and I do enjoy the scent. Just moments after cleansing, I notice a burning, itchy , tightness in my skin followed by microscopic size bumps. So sad, the product has the right look, feel, and texture but my skin does not like it."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Forever a staple,"This will forever be a staple for me. I may not use it consistently but I always find myself going back to it, specifically when I need to regulate my routine. In the winter my skin gets painfully dry due to eczema, this is a life saver during those colder months. Non irritating and good for sensitive skin. Leaves skin feeling clean but never stripped. Soft and supple, goowing skin."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,I use this everyday it’s a must have!,Absolutely amazing! A little pricey but cleared  up my skin in less then 2 weeks. I would definitely recommend this cleanser for people that have oily to dry/ normal skin. This is a game changer
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Malaysia,not too bad ,"i love this product, it has that small granules just like the deep cleanse but i love the deep cleanse better, hence less 0.5 star for this. it does not give as 'fresh feeling' as the deep cleanse"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,A must for every day,"I didn’t want to love this because the price but I am now on my 3rd full size. It legit softens skin, removes makeup well and has helped with pores and blackheads. It’s a must for me now."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,must have,got the face wash in the birthday set and it’s so the best face wash i’ve ever used u only need a small amount for your face love it
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Great cleanser-not so great packaging.,"After finishing a sample, I order the full size. I like the cleanser itself a lot, but the packaging is a fail. The lid separated from the tube after one week of use. I expect better at this price point."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Maybe not for dry skin,"Personally, I found this to not be good for my dry skin. I know they recommend it for dry skin, among the types, but it left me with more dry patches. I had to apply even more moisturizer to combat that. It just wasn't worth it for me. And it didn't really lather."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,This changed my skin,"I got this bday set and I’ve only used it for about a week and it’s made a tremendous improvement to the clarity, suppleness, and evenness if my skin. My skin feels like glass, it’s pore-less, and feels so good!"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,"Got a sample, fell in love.","I didn’t want to like this. It’s way too expensive. But after getting a sample, I caved and bought the full-size because this is the best face wash I’ve ever used. I am in love and it is gonna cost me."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser - 120ml,My favorite face wash leaves my skin so soft and clean/ takes away any redness!
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,I want to love it but..,"I got mine as a birthday gift like many others, I LOVE the way it feels on my skin, the way it smells, and the way it makes my skin feel clean after using. HOWEVER, it broke my skin out SO bad. I do normally have acne here and there but nothing like what I have after using this cleaner… :( so sad because I want to love it!!"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Seriously so soft,"I just got this as a sample for my birthday gift this month, and I'm already in love! It feels like it's sloughing off dead skin without scratching my face up, it thickens up just a bit while you use it but does not strip AT ALL. My skin is the softest and smoothest that it has felt in months. I may be able to just use this as a cleanser and exfoliant and may not even need my chemical exfoliant I've been using!"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,In LOVE :),"I have really bad dry skin, most products I have used never really work. However this product and the 'Hydrating Moisturizer' has been the best thing I have every tried. This has even worked better then the over the counter products 2 different dermatologist have prescribed to me."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Has helped clear my acne,I originally got this in a sample size for my birthday gift and instantly fell in love with it! Recently in the past 2 years I have developed acne and this is the only face cleanser that helps resolve my problem areas (works better than cleansers designed for acne)! I could not rave enough about this product. BUY IT
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,A New Addition to my Routine,"I had previously tried this at a friends house and was immediately in love, so naturally I had to buy my own. While It does leave my skin a little dry afterwards, It is one of the few cleansers I have ever used that has kept my breakouts to a minimum while also catering to my combo/ouly-prone skin. It is gentle and I don’t mind the scent…though if you are sensitive to fragrances I might not recommend."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,The smell.,As much as I want to like this I can’t get passed the scent. I’m not sure if I got a bad sample for my birthday but this face wash smelled baaaaaad. On the other hand it made my face feel smooth and hydrated like other. nootherRegardless I can’t
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,My fave cleanser!,"I have combo skin/dry patches, redness, and acne skin issues and I love this cleanser. It leaves my skin feeling super soft and isn’t irritating. I like that it also exfoliates a little too. It’s a bit pricey but I think it’s worth it!"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Very drying!,"Pros: The facial cleanser feels luxurious on your face as you wash your face with it. It smells good as well.

Cons: This cleanser dried out my skin! It literally zapped the oil and moisture out of my skin leaving it parched and very dry!"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Feels amazing on my skin!,i’ve been using this product since I got my birthday sample in july and I love it! I just had to purchase the full size. it really does make my skin feel so soft!!
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser - 120ml,"Received this as a birthday gift and will definitely be buying the full size, smells amazing without irritating my skin while being moisturizing and is one of the most effective cleansers and cleared my acne significantly in a few days while many other products didnt work"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Must have for dry skin!!,I have very dry skin and I have been searching for a cleanser that will not make my face feel tight and stripped after washing…well this is it! I am so pleased with this product! You only need a small amount like very little it’s very concentrated so you only need about peanut sized dollop smamount
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Awesome cleanser,Love this cleanser. Feels so silky smooth on my skin and doesn’t strip away moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and this has never irritated me at all.
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser - 120ml,"I ran out of my usual cleanser and used a sample I had of this, Made my skin oily and break out. Never had that kind of reaction to a cleanser before."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Lives up to the hype,"Okay I avoided this brand for a while because it felt like another heavily marketed trend but I finally tried this and WOW. Love it. Cleansers seem to have more affect on my skin than other skincare products and this one cleanses well without making my skin super tight and dry. I usually use Mad Hippie's cleanser because it also cleanses well without over drying and keeps my combination skin in check, but this one is a little better at removing makeup. When I feel like splurging I'll get this."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser - 120ml,love it. very gentle and removes make up. doesn't leave your skin dry
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Holy grail,"After using this product, my skins uneven tone was slowly fixed and balanced again, I have normal skin so this cleanser really helps get all the dirty and impurities out without stripping my skinss natural oils.natural in"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,I will never ever use another face wash!,"I've been using this product since it launched and after trying what felt like a hundred different cleansers, I finally found my holy grail. This cream cleanser foams into a gentle wash with a very, very fine grain to it, doesn't strip your skin, and is a perfect cleanser for those with dry, sensitive skin like mine."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,great for sensitive skin,"I bought this for my super sensitive skin and it's perfect, I usually have really dry skin but after using this face wash for a while it's starting to feel a lot less dry and I haven't broken out once! Highly recommend :)"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser - 120ml,"Initially, the smell was a bit too strong, but I got use to it after a while. It leaves my face feeling so soft and hydrated. It's also very gentle on my skin, which I love!"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Never reaching for it,"If you have combination or even normal skin, i feel like this is way too stripping of a cleanser. This isn’t hydrating at all, I wouldn’t say it’s completely drying but it’s too stripping for a everyday cleanser, and way too much fragrance"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Holy! Grail!,"Got this product in the birthday gift, wasn’t expecting much….but MY NEW HOLY GRAIL. It’s the only cleanser I’ve ever used that doesn’t strip my face and doesn’t break me out but leaves my face feeling fresh!"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,Amazing!,"This cleanser is great after just using it for 3 days my face has cleared up of almost all my redness and dry skin, Works great! However it is not for those with sensitive skin as it can cause a lot of irritation."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,"good product, cheap packaging","Good cleanser, gentle for everyday use. The plastic hinge always breaks off so fast. Product itself is fine but for the price, the component should be better."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,just not worth it.,"overpriced , heavy fragrance, horrible value for money, irritation bomb waiting to happen. don’t believe the hype."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,LOVE IT,Got it for my birthday and love it. My skin feels souple after using it for 3 days. Will buy a full size.
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,"got a sample, became a fan",Got this as a sample with no expectations. Not a fan of the dewy moisturizer but wanted to try this brand's other stuff. I have oily sensitive skin. The amount of times people have stopped to tell me how glow my skin is is insane! Thought I was pregnant lol. But nope. This is the only thing I changed. Now even my tried and true cetaphil burns my skin/eyes. This is perfect. Doesn't strip my skin and gently exfoliates. I loooove it! And am buying the full size now lol.
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,DO NOT RECCOMEND,I recently received the mini version for the birthday gift and let’s just say it did not go as expected. After using it for a few days I began to notice bumps on my nose! send the next morning I noticed acne in between my eyebrows and on my chin… in conclusion I’m very disappointed with this product I think irritation was caused by the fragrance in this product.
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,nice texture,"When I tried the sample in the birthday gift it left my skin feeling supple after washing so I decided to buy the full size. My skin feels drier than it did with the birthday size but I still like the wash & it’s consistency. I have dry skin so I need creamy washes. I like the texture, it’s like a light exfoliant. A little goes a long way."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,THE BEST,"This is honestly the best cleanser it hydrates your face, reduces the amount of breakouts and brightens your skin all at the same time. The bottle lasts an extremely long time & you only need a dime size to cover your face/neck. I have acne-prone skin and highly recommend this product."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser - 120ml,Wasn’t a fan. When washing it feels very think and makes my face feel heavy and unclean
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,great for flaky skin,"Received this product as a birthday gift and I absolutely love it. I have dry skin, and over the years it’s started getting flaky around my mouth. Now after giving birth, it’s like it’s spread to my whole face. This product doesn’t exactly fix the problem, but my skin definitely feels hydrated and doesn’t look flaky at all during the day after a morning wash and moisturizer. Loved it so much I instantly bought the full size!"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser - 120ml,this is the best cleanser I have ever used! I did notice that the first time I used it I did get a little breakout but on my second time using it the breakout cleared completely. this is an amazing product and I think it would definitely be worth the money. I would recommend this to everyone.
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,holy grail,Leaves my skin clean and soft. I have hormonal acne and it doesn’t dry me out or create new flare ups. I had a regular bottle at first but it worked so well I got the jumbo version.
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,MUST TRY,Love this product. I have stress acne and it’s mostly cleared from trying out the sample! Also great for those with more oily skin. Leaves my skin feeling clean and soft!
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Amazing Cleanser,The Tatcha Rice Wash Cleanser is an amazing face wash. You know a cleanser works when your face feels dried out after. It was an amazing smell to it and you only need a little pea sized amount to get a good lather. It has a grainy texture and it’ll leave your skin soft and clean.
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,Best. Cleanser. Ever.,Originally bought a trial size and loved it from the first wash. It’s amazingly creamy with little crystals the dissolve. It’s moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling so soft.
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Not for me,"Began using this a few weeks ago, no other change in products. It has damaged my skin barrier, making my skin more textured and dry."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Malaysia,expansive but worth it,"How do I even start. So expansive but so worth it! I’m on my 2nd tube & has purchased 3rd one during the sales. One tube (I use this twice a day) lasted me around 4-5 months. So even it’s expansive but it last long. And it’s such a good product. My face has no acne issues to begin with, just dehydrated skin & oily t zone. This facial is so gentle, doesn’t make ur skin feels dry/tight/oily, just the right softness, cleanliness feeling. This will be my always go to/no 1 at the moment. If you hv dehydration related skin condition. Give this a try!"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Dried me out twice,"Generally speaking I love tatcha products. The cleansing oil and the water cream are part of my regular line up. I have tried this product twice, when it came as part of a set, and both times after a week of use I ended up with dry, flaky skin that resolved after I stopped using it. My skin is typically normal-to-dry but I also live in a very humid climate, so I wouldn’t say dry skin is a major problem for me, but with this product it was noticeable. I couldn’t wear any face makeup for a week or two because it would highlight the flakey spots. It has a lovely smell, and it feels nice, and the light texture seems to vanish when it’s rubbed in (I’m not sure if it provides any exfoliating at all, it’s so fine and disappears so quickly), so two stars for “cosmetic elegance,” but ultimately it is not for me. I really can’t understand how this would be called “hydrating” or described as not “stripping” the skin because neither of those were true for me."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser - 120ml,It is not good for dry skin as it makes your skin even more dry. Dissapointed!
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser - 120ml,"My new favorite addition to my skin care!! Literally I won’t ever be using another cleanser again. I have dry skin, this makes my skin not just feel good afterwards but it instantly makes it LOOK good. Seriously I’m not kidding, I don’t know how it’s possible but right after washing this off and patting my skin dry, my face looks brighter and tighter, the lines on my face and the darkness from them almost disappear"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser - 120ml,"Very poor package for this price. 

I just finished this cleanser,but not impressed unfortunately…."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser - 120ml,"The best cleanser I have used 
It leaves my skin really soft and it has restored my looking skin"
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,USA,Caused Terrible Breakout,"At first I loved this cleanser. it has a somewhat gritty texture so it lightly exfoliates without stripping your skin. But after about a week of using it along with the Tatcha Dewy Skin Hydrating and Plumping Moisturizer, I broke out with terrible acne all over my chin and forehead - I normally have very clear skin and, aside from a random pimple or two every once in a while, I never break out like this. I will never use anything from Tatcha again after the experience I had with this product."
TATCHA-The Rice Wash Cleanser,Canada,Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser - 120ml,Love love love this! Totally recommend! Lasts a long time!

SHU UEMURA-Anti/Oxi+ Pollutant And Dullness Clarifying Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Good cleansing oil,Great facial cleansing oil which removes makeup well 
SHU UEMURA-Anti/Oxi+ Pollutant And Dullness Clarifying Cleansing Oil,Canada,"Awesome, but double cleanse is a must!!","Great product, removes makeup well. The oil is very light which I like, I use generous amounts to cover face+neck. However, you need to double cleanse after using this product. The skin after washing the face is a bit oily, I double cleanse regardless. Also, considering the size, the price is not that bad."
SHU UEMURA-Anti/Oxi+ Pollutant And Dullness Clarifying Cleansing Oil,Singapore,All time favourite!,Can't remember how many bottles I've gone through. 
SHU UEMURA-Anti/Oxi+ Pollutant And Dullness Clarifying Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Favourite cleansing oil of all time,"Possibly my favourite cleansing oil of all time! Thick yet smooth, very easy to glide around and massage on my face. Feels very refreshed after washing off. "

SHU UEMURA-Anti/Oxi+ Pollutant And Dullness Clarifying Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Decided to re-try this,"I used to use the previous version of this product and I really loved it. But I had switched out in hopes to fine something better only to come back to this. This reformulated version does the job equally as good. This takes the day off like a gem, getting rid of the dirt and makeup accumulated throughout the day. Better still, this cleansing oil is so nourishing for the dryer areas of my face. Definitely sticking to this. "
SHU UEMURA-Anti/Oxi+ Pollutant And Dullness Clarifying Cleansing Oil,Canada,My go-to makeup remover oil for 10 years,"I have been using this product since 2014, and thus finished at least 6 bottles.

SHU UEMURA-Anti/Oxi+ Pollutant And Dullness Clarifying Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Repurchase,"Wonderful cleansing oil. Removes mascara very thoroughly and doesn’t leave skin feeling parched, rinses off well even without the second cleanse with a regular face cleanser."
SHU UEMURA-Anti/Oxi+ Pollutant And Dullness Clarifying Cleansing Oil,Singapore,hate the texture ,hands down my go-to brand for oil cleanser but I hate the texture for this green bottle. I prefer the pink bottle for oily skin. I don’t think this suits acneprone skin because the texture feels so heavy and thick. It is more suited for dry skin. Not for me. 
SHU UEMURA-Anti/Oxi+ Pollutant And Dullness Clarifying Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Efficient,"Remove make up efficiently and not harsh to the skin. Love the packaging that you can lock and unlock the pump easily, you can even bring it out for staycation/travel."
SHU UEMURA-Anti/Oxi+ Pollutant And Dullness Clarifying Cleansing Oil,Canada,AMAZING,This product is amazing for everything. Generally the brand is very good I also use the hair oil. I have had this one bottle for over a year as very little works good. I recently started using it on my body as well for dark armpits and it’s been amazing. Results are slow but if you’re consistent it will and does work. I apply on my face when removing my make up and then use wipes to clean it off. It takes off so much of my make up and water proof mascara.
SHU UEMURA-Anti/Oxi+ Pollutant And Dullness Clarifying Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Amazing,"Have been using this product for years. Every time I switch to a new make up remover, I always end up coming back to this. It takes off ALL my makeup including waterproof mascara within seconds of rubbing in. Use as instructed and you will not be disappointed! "
SHU UEMURA-Anti/Oxi+ Pollutant And Dullness Clarifying Cleansing Oil,Singapore,best cleanser!,When I tried shu uemura cleansing oil I never look for another brand because its the best! Like seriously the best! Though its on the pricey side it still go a lon way and it really did melt your most stubborn make up away! 
FRESH-Best Of Beauty Bundle (Christmas Limited Edition),Australia,A nice gift set,If you enjoy the scent of rose and need hydration this is for you. I didn't find it made any real difference to my acne but it's natural and it's just rose/fruit and so I'm not surprised. I like to store the toner in the fridge for the morning so its nice and cold before I start my skincare routine. 
FRESH-Best Of Beauty Bundle (Christmas Limited Edition),Malaysia,Great Product,I’ve been eyeing fresh products but too expensive to buy the real size ones. So i bought the christmas bundle just to see wether the products suit my skin or not and turned out they do. The toner is gentle but does the work. The moisturiser is non sticky and makes your skin hydrated. The face wash makes my skin smoother. All in all they are good combinations. Just i wish the serum is included in this bundle

"

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,Great as a double cleanser..,"It cleaned my skin and removed makeup well without stripping it. That said, I wear very little makeup, so it worked ok for me. I will not repurchase because I prefer a gel cleanser. Also,I felt like I had to double cleanse with this one. I like products that stand alone."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Philippines,Honest review,"This is a blind buy due to good reviews here, but it disappointed me! First of all the smell is so strong and unpleasant! it smells chemical-y. This product stings my skin, especially in the morning, have to wash it out immediately, definitely not for all skin type, I have oily acne prone sensitive skin. Watch out if you have sensitive skin, it contains perfume which I overlooked before buying. The foam is very watery it doesn’t have much bubble, it almost disappear while I rub my face, I don’t feel it does the cleansing job well. "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,cleans my makeup too! ,Gentle cleanser that can remove my everyday makeup! Bought this to try the formula and it suits my skin! Smells florally which is nice and leave my face super hydrated! Gonna repurchase this in bigger size!

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,the best foaming cleanser,"the best foaming cleanser i use n now i repeat again and stay with this product..im so happy..sugeest for all skin...for dry skin, oily..or normal skin also can"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser - 150ml,"This is an ok cleanser, I am not usually a foaming face wash kind of person. I don’t use it every day, just when I want a quick and easy cleanse after a mask or in the morning if I feel like I need it. It is a good alternative for when I want to be clean without using any active ingredients. I don’t like that it has perfume in it. They use flower and sage extracts which would give it a nice natural scent but the perfume is over powering and not good for your skin. I won’t buy it again, it is not good for a deep clean or to clean out your pores and I just really hate the perfume. There is also alcohol on the ingredients list. I must say I do feel soft and fresh after using it."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,one of my favourite face cleansers ,i used to use an older version of this back in 2015 and then moved onto other cleansers as i wanted to change up my routine. bought this again to try and fell in love. it is very gentle but still does an amazing job of cleansing my face. it also has a very pleasant smell. has become one of my favourite cleansers
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,Favorite New Cleanser,"I’ve tried a lot of cleansers over the years, and this instantly became my new favorite! I got it as apart of a pack of Caudalie products in mini sizes as I’d already found success with their hand cream, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked everything in it. I have naturally very clear skin, but am prone to dryness, and start feeling it immediately after showering. Using this cleanser regularly followed by their moisturizer soothed my skin and made it more pristine than ever before! One pump also goes a long way, and you have enough for your face and neck. Finally, the scent is light but present, and feels clean without being overwhelming. 5/5!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Australia,Go to..!,"Been using this product for 3 years now and love it. I also love the mist spray from Caudalie! So refreshing. Find that this foaming cleanser leaves my skin fresh, removes makeup gently and doesn’t strip my skin if it’s natural jus jus. "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,Gentle,Very gentle to the skin and lightly scented. Generally a fan of foaming cleaners. Really cleans the face and leaves the face feeling fresh. Not drying at all
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,150ml,"The foam was smooth and tiny, easy to use and also it won’t make your skin feel like very dry after using it. Smells okay, not like too chemical products but also not like naturally products. Just okay, and nice to be use and it does cleaned your skin."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser - 150ml,"I initially didn’t want this cleanser , but it was the only one in store. With that said I’m glad I purchased it. It cleans your face gently without drying it out, and it makes your skin feel refreshed. I love the complete line and I’m happy to add this to my collection"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Australia,best cleanser ,"Great for getting makeup off and leaving the skin looking and feeling soft. Doesn’t dry skin out like a normal foaming cleanser. Is a must in my skincare routine!!!

"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,Good Cleanser,Although this cleanser is slightly pricey but it sure is pne of the best cleansers i ever purchased! It is in foam texture and it smells so good! Highly recommend to give it a try. 
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,Too irritating,"I like foaming cleansers and I really wanted to like this one as I have had great results with other  Caudalie products. Unfortunately, This cleanser irritated my skin and caused severe breakouts on both cheeks, chin and forehead. I has to use a cortisone cream to calm my skin and only use the Caludalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil. In less than a week, my skin calmed back down after I stopped using it. I'll be returning the product."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Canada,Worst,Omg this is AWFUL!!! “Gentle” doesn’t have to be “non cleansing”. My skin has never felt dirtier and oilier than after using this gross product for a couple weeks. I may as well not even be washing my face at all! I have broken out as if I was going through puberty again! I’m 44 this should not be happening. Not only does it not clean your face but it adds too much fragrance to it. Hard pass on this one. Sticking to my Farmacy Whipped Greens.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,my holy grail morning cleanser ,"This is not like the normal foaming cleanser where it usually leaves your skin dry and tight, this does the job of cleaning well and leaving your skin fresh and soft without feeling tight. The foam is light and smells fresh, nothing overpowering. Recommended! "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Canada,Nice daily product!,"I use this every day, morning and night! It feels nice to apply it with a cleansing brush and it's a mousse so you can make bubbles with it lol."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,Smooth Skin ,"After using this Cleanser, i realised my skin is softer after cleansing and give that fresh feeling after wash. It is gentle on the skin and remove dirts on the face gently without feeling dry. "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,Great,Caudalie Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser 50ml really nice smell when using. So surprised. And my skin feel very clean after it. Love it so much and i been recommended this to others.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser - 150ml,terrible not worth the price .it doesn't remove make up
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,Repurchased,"Been using this for a couple of years now and it’s been great for oily combination skin but it does not leave my face feeling tight or dry. 1 pump is enough for face and neck and 1 bottle can last for a good few months so it’s worth the money.

"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Australia,Amazing,"After not getting what I needed I thought I would try this out and loved it. I personally like to use foaming cleansers, though foaming cleansers are not good for the skin with the chemicals etc, this one was beautiful. Leaves my skin nice and refreshing. Then topping my routine off with a moisturiser after this was perfect"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,The best!,Best cleanser ever! I've been using it for years and I can't do without it. I love the foamy texture and light scent. Super gentle cleanser does great for my super sensitive skin.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Canada,"Fantastic Product, Extremely Gentle","I decided to try something new so bought this. I love the consistency and the smell and wanted this to be my new usual, but it was just too gentle for my skin and I just kept breaking out. 
Regardless, I would still recommend to anyone looking for a really gentle cleanser."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Australia,THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING ,This product is so good. It feels soft on my skin and is so gentle and moisturising. I would recommend using a facial cleansing brush with this product because it helps with exfoliating. I would recommend this product to everyone. 
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,did not like,The smell is terrible. It is very drying and does not wash off makeup.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Australia,great basic cleanser,This is a good basic cleanser. The instant foaming formula makes this a great one to keep in the shower. I tend to use this in the morning only and use other cleansers at night that get makeup off better. My daughter also finds this is great for her teenage skin.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,So So,"The smell is kind of weird. Not fan of the smell. I don't think this is really for dry skin, my dry skin gets ever more dry, lol. Will not be repurchase in the future."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,Perfect for Rosacea,I have never used such a gentle cleanser before!! Even Cetaphil  isn’t as calming I have Rosacea and am always careful about what products I use. You only need one pump it covers your whole face so this should last awhile. Your skin doesn’t feel dry after use and No Redness!! Highly recommend
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,Just a normal cleanser,"I usually have normal to combination (oily Tzone) and this doesn't break me out like the Caudalie Purifying cleanser so its okay to me, not really sure of the foam dries out my skin or not."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser - 150ml,"I’ve been using this cleanser forever. I love the consistency. Despite being a foaming cleanser it doesn’t feel drying at all unlike most foaming cleansers.  It has a nice smell, not too fragrant. Leaves my skin super clean without drying it. That being said, I have been breaking out lately which is why I’m not giving it 5 stars. Maybe my skin needs a little break. Will update"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,Instant Pleasure,"Nothing beats the feeling of gently rubbing the cleanser into your face and instantly feeling your skin feel cleaner, refreshed and tighter.

Pros:

Cons:
- Expensive considering the small volume"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,Must buy!!!,General yet very effective. This is my new go to for an AM cleanser. I have combo skin so this is mild enough to keep me clean and clear but not overly drying. Always loved this brand and this is just another gem!

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Canada,Buy it!!,"Awesome product, one pump gives you exactly enough foam to cleanse your entire face. Leaves skin feeling moisturized, highly recommend."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,Too much fragrance,It's a mild face foaming. I use it in the morning. But the fragrant smell is a bit strong for me. I need time to get used to it. Should be good to sensitive skin.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,fave cleanser,"My favourite cleanser of all time! So gentle, doesnt make my skin tight and it smells really good too. Good to stock up as duo set gives u more discount."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Australia,not good,"Not as expected, I don’t think it can wash face that clean. It is not cheap, I used up it within 2 months. The forms feels like quite watery. When apply it on the face, it easy to burst to water, not much bubbles on face. Claudine’s Grape Water is really recommended.
"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Canada,great for the ladies and the mens!,"Literally the one cleanser I keep going back to over and over. I made my dad switch to it too cuz he has sensitive skin, and it’s the only one he likes. So ladies if you want the men in your life to use a decent cleanser this one is not overpowering in scent for them and easy to use! Doesn’t dry out your skin either! A+ all around"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Australia,Staple for sensitive skin!!,"I bought this on a whim as a recommendation off someone on YouTube, and boy am I glad I did! I have extremely sensitive, combo skin and prone to break outs. I wanted a foam cleanser that would thoroughly clean my face without leaving it striped from moisture and red raw—this does exactly that! My face is super clean and hydrated after using this every single day. I have actually just run out and am making a special trip to grab a new one (or two) on the weekend, I seriously can’t be without this stuff! If you have the same issues as me, you need to try this, asap! "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,Love it!,Love this foam cleanser. Makes my skin feel and doesn't make it feel dry.

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Canada,gentle but drying,"gentle but drying.
wouldnt buy again.. actually want to return it but i think i used too much haha. SAD."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,Simple wash,Clean simple wash is part of my everyday routine. Leaves my skin fresh
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Canada,"Staple for sensitive, acne-prone, combo skin.","I bought this cleaner because I was looking for a gentle cleanser with antioxidant properties. I’ve loved it so much that it has become a staple in my skincare routine (followed by the Vinopure toner). 
What I love: it’s soft, cloud like texture that effectively removes dirt and leaves my skin feeling cleansed, without feeling tight. *Note that when wearing makeup I do use a cleansing oil before using this - otherwise, I used it on its own. 
What I don’t love: I’ve bought this cleanser three times now, and 2/3 times I bought it, there was a faint but noticeable egg white smell to it (I don’t know if that’s just me or others have noticed it). The last time I bought it, it wasn’t there (maybe I had just gotten used to it?). 

Overall, definitely a staple in my sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin through all seasons."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Canada,"Great cleanser, but smells too strong",I really like how this cleans my face every night after double masking for 8 hours. The only thing that I am not happy with is the fragrance/scent. It’s a bit too strong for me.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser - 150ml,I love this foam it feels so great and doesn’t dry my skin.

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,LOVE THIS!,"My all time favorite cleaner... I always buy 2 at a time, because I never want to run out. Very light, fresh and removes all makeup. An absolute staple for my daily routine."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,Allergic reaction!,I have used the old version of the Instant Foaming Cleanser and loved it!!! I used this for the first time yesterday night and woke up with an allergic reaction. I haven’t changed anything else with my skin care routine. Returning!!
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Canada,Stings my eyes,"Why change a good thing? Similarly to the vinoperfect serum, the formula has been changed for this foaming cleanser. It USED TO BE my go-to cleanser, gentle enough for my eyes but effective and left a clean feeling without making my skin feel dry. Now this NEW FORMULATION stings and hurts my eyes and leaves my face feeling much drier than the original formula. Will not be repurchasing."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,Morning Cleanser,This is one of my favorite cleansers! I love using this cleanser in the mornings because of the foam. It is super gentle and does not strip the skin. May not be the best to take off makeup but that is why I love using it in the mornings to take off my skincare from the night.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser - 150ml,"purchased this twice in the past and i loveddd this gentle foam cleanser; perfect for my sensitive combo skin. however, when i bought this new bottle, i felt something was off… i compared the ingredients between my old and new bottle and there were only minor changes, so there shouldn’t be a drastic difference, right?! i used it consistently for two weeks and it was the only change to my skincare routine. sadly, my skin became drier and i had more whitehead appear throughout the weeks. i returned this product and am now back on the hunt for a new cleanser staple :("
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser - 150ml,I use it in the shower every morning along with a gentle face brush. It leaves my skin fresh and hydrated. I have been using it for about 3 years now. I have fair sensitive skin. A bit oily on the nose and dry everywhere else.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,great as second step,"I love this as a second step cleanser, as it removes all cleansing oil residue and any lingering traces of makeup without over drying (tho it is a bit on the stronger side so very dry or sensitive skin might have an issue). For no makeup days I find it works well to use alone."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,good,I liked the old bottle better. For some reason the new packaging made me feel like the consistency of the cleanser has changed. Feels little too watery.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser - 150ml,Great product. It smells amazing and leaves the skin clean.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser - 150ml,"Nice cleanser. Very gentle, but my skin felt clean afterwards, and was not irritated at all. Barely any smell, and two pumps are enough for your face. i wouldn't say that it is moisturizing, i feel like this one is better suited for summer than for cold months, but will definitely repurchase next year."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Australia,instant cleanser,I used this product for couple of times but fall in love during my pregnancy. Its cleans perfectly with natural clean  ingredients. My friend also bought this seeing from me and she loved it too.

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,hydrating ,"Been using this for almost 2 weeks now and I can safely say this doesn’t even dry out my skin. It’s smells like mild and nice. If you want to try something safe that doesn’t pull out your natural oil from your skin, this is the one. "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Australia,Co,A beautiful cleanser used in conjunction with the oil cleanser for a double cleanse.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Australia,10/10 you get what you pay for :D,"This is a fab foaming cleanser that actually cleans your face. 1-2 pumps give you plenty of foam to cover your face and get the top level of dirt/make up off but then, instead of fizzing away, once the bubbles deflate you are left with product that can continue to clean your skin. Its smooth, lathering and doesn't dry out your skin. Also has a light cucumber fresh fragrance which I liked."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,love this foaming cleanser so much,"Normally I don't use cleanser in the morning as I have dehydrated skin, but with this gentle foaming cleanser, it cleanse my skin without remove extra moist."

I highly recommend for those who usually double cleanses their face after makeup."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Foam,USA,amazing cleanser!,"I was struggling with breakouts not understanding why. Until i decided to change my face cleanser because my hunch was saying that it had something to do with it. And I found this cleanser, not expecting it to do anything to me. But i was amazed of how it stopped my breakout from getting worse in just 2 uses. Combine with the oil cleanser they have, im absolutely speechless of how my skin become so much better now, from cleansing my face with the right products. Im tempted to try their other stuff now, i hope it will work for me as well."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Foam,USA,Absolutely LOVE it,"I have combo, but lean towards oily skin. For someone who works at a restaurant this cleanser is a must have.

SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Foam,USA,Don't understand the great reviews,"Product is slimy. Has a slightly nice smell. Does not work that well, especially with removal of eye makeup. I constantly have to go back and remove my eye makeup. 

I'm the type of person to read reviews very skeptically. This could work for you, but I wear make up 12 hours a day & need something that actually works. I bought the 1.69 fl.oz., & almost gave it away. I bought another product which actually does melt the makeup off. This product is not worth the waste of money."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,will repeat again!,"Omg, Best! Kulit tak kering lepas cuci. &&& boleh tahan sampai setahun ok 😅 I pakai sikit pun dah banyak buih. I sukaaaaaa! Will repeat again! Heeeeeeee"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Pretty good cleanser,"At first, I’m not quite a fan of the herbal smell of this cleanser but after using for a while I got used to the scent. I like that this cleanser doesn’t dry up my skin. It lathers into foam easily as well"

SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,cleanser,A bit pricey but just a little goes a long way. Very foamy and cleans the face and neck well. Won't feel the tightness after use. For aging and sensitive skin like mine it's still fine but will try to find one that leave the skin having a moisurisered feeling. 
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Foam,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Foam - 50ml,"i got this for a trip because my usual face wash doesn’t come in a mini size and it is just so perfect. i was really worried about trying a new product because i have pretty dry skin, but this made my face feel super smooth. my skin is already pretty clear but i feel like this is helping to perfect it. and it kinda smells like pine which was a very pleasant surprise. this is my new favorite product i actually love it so much"

SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Worth it,"A little goes a long way with this product. I only have to do a very minimal pump and the product is able to cleanse my whole face. Skin doesn’t give any negative reactions to it however, it’s a bit too fragrant. The scent it a bit too strong for my liking and fragrance is never good for your skin."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Foam,USA,Amazing,I absolutely love this it’s hydrating yet takes all your makeup off! So luxurious to use and one pump is perfect for the whole face! Go buy !
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Foam,Philippines,great but a bit pricey,"This is better than average cleansers. But it is also pricier than many cleansers. It is really gentle. It has a citrusy herbal smell and lathers well. With its price point, I prefer the fresh soy cleanser. But overall good! "
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Good for combination /dry skin and value for money,"I first tried a small sample and was sold when the soap smelled nice and did not dry out my skin. This is definitely the most value for money compared to Chanel, Fresh and etc. Worth it during sale time!"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,the gentlest foaming cleanser ever ,"My second purchase, and first bottle takes forever to be emptied. I think can last for 6 months if use twice daily. Just need a small pump (pea size) and it lather very well. It definitely is gentle, though it comes in foaming cleanser form. My skin loves it so much. Tried other Sulwhasoo products but dont quite enjoy them so I am sticking with just the cleanser."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Ms,Saw good review for this cleanser. Its big bottle with a pump. It’s suitable for sensitive skin without drying skin. Will get it again during member sales. 
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Worth. Every. Dollar!,"I might have accidentally found my new holy grail skincare favourite! I've been using so many facial washes, but none have given me such amazing results for my combination skin. I was a bit sceptical due to the price, but Sulwhasoo proved me wrong. My face feels smoother and clean with every wash. I don't even wake up with oily skin anymore! I'll definitely repurchase when I'm done with this bottle. "
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Highly Recommend !!,"I have combination skin, oily t-zone. Been repurchasing for many years. Does its job very well, leaving skin supple. I also notice that my t-zone do not get as oily easily as compared to if I do not use this. "
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Good cleanser,It's a good cleanser but there's nothing outstanding about it! Just an average cleanser but smells great!
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,best face wash so far,"Pros:
- light scent, not too strong but smells pleasant 
- face feels clean and comfortable after wash
- does not cause breakouts on my oily skin
- for the price point, i think it’s worth the money, as the quality will speak for itself. 

Cons:
- the cleanser will turn watery after few weeks if placed in shower area. Need to store it in cool dry place.

In my 5th bottles so far, and no intention to try other brand yet."

THE INKEY LIST-Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser,Australia,One of my favourite cleansers ,"I get sick of products really easily which is why I was so taken aback by this product. I purchased it on a whim because my usual cleanser was out of stock and ever since I’ve literally been using this up and repurchasing, I’m on my 6th bottle.

THE INKEY LIST-Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,Gentle and lovely cleanser,"I've recently converted to most inkey list products and boy are they good! This doesn't have a distinct scent, it cleanses gently but surely, and for the price it's a big tube, definitely worth your money!"
THE INKEY LIST-Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser,Australia,I wanted to love it :(,"I have dry to combo skin with psoriasis as a bonus, I found the cleanser very drying and suck the moisture out of my skin.

Nothing beats their oat cleanser."

THE INKEY LIST-Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser,USA,Just ok,"This is okay for a basic cleanser. I used the whole bottle and couldn’t see any difference in my skin or in the efficacy of makeup removal. For the price and size though, this is a good item to keep in a guest shower. Despite the price, I’ll be going back to my FAB cleanser."
THE INKEY LIST-Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser,USA,The Inkey List Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser - 150ml,"Great cleanser, you can really see the brighter skin right after.  Great price!"

THE INKEY LIST-Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser,Australia,This brand has no business being so cheap! ,"The price point of this brand is insane but I am extremely pleased about it. I am so sick of paying through the teeth for stuff that barely works. This stuff works, the entire brand has fabulous stuff and I have been using it mostly for moisturising, uneven skin tone, hyper pigmentation and some light scarring and I can already see a difference. I WILL be buying backups this week I’m not even waiting to run out of anything, best skin care I’ve found for a LONG time, especially at this price. "
THE INKEY LIST-Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,Amazing ,"I have dry and acne prone skin but this does not dry me out or irritate my skin.

THE INKEY LIST-Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser,USA,cheap but effective topical wash-off acid cleanser,"Needed a new cleanser and grabbed this with an order. I wasn’t expecting much, but after a few uses, I noticed my face seemed more clarified without feeling dry.  I have facial eczema and use this in addition to retinol, lactic acid and salicylic acid actives without issues.  If I’m worried my skin is going to be too dry, I switch with a hydrating cleanser every few washes."
THE INKEY LIST-Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser,Australia,Affordable and great product ,"This cleanser feels luxurious. Although it gently exfoliates the skin, I do not find it irritates my skin as I used it daily - AM/PM. I feel my skin soft and clean. However, I do not find it brightens my skin and I do not mind as it is not my main concern. Highly recommended for all types of skin. "
THE INKEY LIST-Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,HM,Not sure what to feel about this. I personally don't like the scent. it's a decent cleanser. nothing good nothing bad. just thought it would have a brightening effect but I don't see it
THE INKEY LIST-Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser,Australia,okay,"its an alright cleanser that makes your skin feel clean without being stripped. however, it definitely feels kinda cheap, smells a bit like chemicals and i didn't really see any sort of brightening at all. its an alright cleanser but i wouldn't buy it again, and probably add a bit more $ to get something a bit nicer. "
THE INKEY LIST-Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser,USA,Ehh,"It did nothing for my skin.. like at all. It didn’t break me out or anything but it just didn’t do what It was supposed to do. It didn’t brighten but it did leave my skin feeling clean, so I guess there’s that. It’s a whatever product, usually I love the Inkey List but this product was not it."
THE INKEY LIST-Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser,USA,The Inkey List Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser - 150ml,I didnt see a change on my skin.  Wouldnt repurchase.

THE INKEY LIST-Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser,Australia,Nice for the price,You get what you pay for. Basic cleanser that does what a basic cleanser should do. 
THE INKEY LIST-Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser,New Zealand,A new fav!,"A great cleanser, highly recommend for combo skin. Might be a bit too drying for dry skin. Has a subtle smell and a gel like texture. A great buy and budget friendly!"
THE INKEY LIST-Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser,USA,inexpensive and works,"I got a sample of my this from the Inkey List and fell in love with it. I don’t have acne, but I get hormonal breakouts every month. This cleared them up. No cleanser or skincare product I have ever used has been able to get rid of them. This cleanser was the only change I made in my routine. It’s magic, and the full size tube is huge! It’s an excellent value for the amount of product you get. The sample version lasted me a month, so I can’t imagine how long the full size will last me."
THE INKEY LIST-Fulvic Acid Brightening Cleanser,USA,stinks,SMELLS HORRIBLE SO BAD I HAD TO RETURN IT THE NEXT DAY

DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Must have for travel.,So happy my favorite face wash comes in a travel size! Couldn’t live without this stuff.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,Canada,Break out city,I got this in a gift set to try out. I typically use the inlet list SA cleanser and have it on repeat this cleanser made me break out. There’s nothing special about it if you have acne prone skin stay away but if you’re fine and not prone to breakouts this might be ok?
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,Canada,Solid,This product is working well for me! I find it to have effective exfoliating properties without stripping/drying out my skin. I’ve had absolutely zero adverse side effects and have experienced less breakouts since using it!
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel - 60ml,Gave it a two because I expect it to exfoliate. Just a basic mild face cleaner. It doesn’t have soap and won’t dry your face out.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,Singapore,love this,Skin feels clean and it’s so tough finding a proper cleanser that contains AHA acids! The gel is really viscous too so you don’t have to pump too much product at a time. Will definitely repurchase
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,Canada,Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel - 225ml,"I read conflicted review, in which some say it made their skin break out, some other people really liked it. I gave it a shot, and thankfully it worked nicely for me. It cleans without drying"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,Canada,Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel - 225ml,"This is the best cleanser 
I just got it 3 times!
Worth it!"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,don’t buy if you like your skin,"I would no recommend if you have sensitive and acne prone skin. It broke me out in huge massive pimples to the point my whole face is broken out. Hopefully I do not scar, buyer beware the glowing reviews"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,Singapore,cleanses well,"I haven’t used it long enough to notice if the AHA/BHA has any effect on me, but in the few times I’ve used it, it’s been really good at cleansing my face. I used to triple cleanse (makeup remover, face wash, DDG peel) every night but now I’ve gotten rid on the makeup remover and just massage this cleanser onto my face. Somehow it works! Just a tad too expensive though. "
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Highly recommended,Great for combination skin like mine. It helps to reduce my blemishes and it cleanses well. I love it. 
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Not Worth It,I have oily/combo skin and this dried me out to the point of peeling after two uses. Will be returning
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Worth It,"I do really like this product and for the most part it keeps my face clean and acne free. I will get the occasional hormonal acne, but for the most part it's been affective. I also only buy the small bottle. It lasts a really long time."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Clean and fresh feeling,Great product leaves skin feeling fresh and clean not dry. Like that it lathers into foam. Love using it with my Clarisonic. It cleared up my breakouts as well!
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,100% Recommend,I purchased a travel size for a trip and haven’t turned back since! This stuff keeps my skin clear and so smooth. It’s the best!
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,Canada,not for me…,"Effective cleanser but definitely not for normal, dry, and combination skin and definitely not for daily use! My skin was so dry and peeling after using it! 
Very effective at cleansing, removed makeup well and was gentle around the eyes but I don’t think I can continue to use it and I wouldn’t recommend it."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel - 225ml,Everything DDG makes is amazing. I have very dry skin that is always tight after cleansing but I also break out. This is one of the only cleansers that doesn’t make my skin feel like the life has been sucked out of it afterwards. It’s a thick gel. Cleans everything without stripping.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel - 225ml,I love using this cleanser as a makeup remover it’s especially effective to remove stubborn eye makeup / mascara eyeliner it’s not irritating gentle on skin. It foams up and removes all dirt. Leaves my face feeling super clean and fresh.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,Canada,magic product,"Worked like magic , cleared my acne and damaged skin in few weeks"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Fave morning cleanser!,"Absolutely love this product! Second time buying it, just put my third one in my cart and thought I'd write a review. It doesn't strip my skin unlike many other cleansers do (especially those with AHAs, BHAs etc.) and it really helps keep my black heads in check."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,Canada,too mild of a cleanser and overpriced.,Honestly there are better cleansing gels out there. I didn’t notice a difference in my skin at all. Overpriced and very mild cleanser. Doesn’t do much in my opinion.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel - 225ml,This has become my favorite cleanser. My face feels and looks really smooth and it really helped with my dark spots. It’s easy to lather and my skin doesn’t feel tight after using it. I’ll never use another cleanser after this one.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Great,Not too strong for my sensitive skin. Mix it with water in your hands for it to foam and it applies easier
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Great daily wash and 5-minute mask,"This is my favorite AM cleanser. I have normal skin and only have issues with it being too drying if I use it as a second cleanse at night (it doesn't remove makeup especially well on its own... that's not what it's designed to do). 

Value for money: DDG puts this in gift sets so it's not too hard to find a freebie to try, but I've happily paid full price for the 7.5oz because it's a great maintenance acid treatment: I accidentally discovered that it makes a great flash mask. Sometimes I let it rest on my face for a few minutes while brushing teeth or getting ready, and for me it's near the same results as the ""gentle"" AB peels.

Lasts for ages because you only need half a pump each time. It's very viscous/thick, which takes some getting used to... if you are finding it hard to spread evenly, try lathering it in your hands a bit more before applying. I use it with an ultrasonic device about half the time, but it's fine on its own too."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,Canada,Good for rosacea,"I keep this cleanser in my rotation. I have dry skin so I can’t use this daily, however I find that it works well for my rosacea. If I use it more than 3 times a week I get dry spots on my chin. I just use a dime-size drop and leave it on my face while I brush my teeth, but it does take some work washing it off. Overall, I’m really happy with the product and will continue to buy it."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Drying the skin,"My skin is dry after usage, and I do not like that is so thick and hard to leather"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,My Favorite Face Wash:),I love this face wash.  It really cleans my skin so well but never leaves it feeling dry.  I think it is helping my skins clarity.  I love to that it is cruelty free.  If it helps to know I am 50 years old.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Loooooooooveeeeee it!,"Loooooooooveeeeee it! Cleans well and doesn’t leave face dry, you willl need to moisturize after though! My dermatologist confirmed it was a great cleanser"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel - 225ml,"Consult with professional first. This along with the kit is very intense and contains a lot of acids. One thing that was clear was the intensity of the cleanser in particular as tiny red bumps all over my face occurred after washing. Other than that, it wasn’t drying which is OK. Sensitive skin types should use with caution and not introduce a lot of intense products at once."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel - 225ml,Soooo good! Compared to other cleansers I’ve tried my face feels so refreshed and cleaner without the over stripped feeling! Highly recommend!!
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Meh,"I love the Dr. Dennis Gross alpha beta peel pads so I thought I would give this a go. Honestly, nothing wrong, probably, with the cleanser. BUT....I just can't with the texture! It is so thick and goopy that it doesn't really feel like it's doing anything. Additionally I like a cleanser I can use to remove my eye makeup and this says not to go near the eye area with this so I was super stressed while using it that I would hurt my eyes. Just more hassle than it's worth in my honest opinion."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel - 225ml,This is an awesome cleanser. I recently started using this face cleanser and I love it. It cleanses the face without stripping it. 5 stars!
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Always in rotation,Consistent staple.  Gentle and effective.  Have tried so many others and keep coming back.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel - 60ml,"I rarely write reviews unless I’m blown away by a product. This one delivers! I have large pores and combo skin in my 40s and this cleanser leaves my face so bright and clean with ample moisture! I pair it with caudelie toner,retinol and the Dr. Gross serum I wake up looking refreshed though I’m sleep deprived from being a toddler mom and working and grad school juggler! Trust me you’ll see smoother skin in days!"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel - 225ml,I love this cleanser and use it 2-3 times a day depending if I work out. It doesn’t strip my skin or make it feel tight. It does make it feel clean and have seen my skin clear up and even out. I no longer have combo skin and with wearing masks there are the occasional pimples that I follow up this cleaners with the cleansing acne pads and clears everything right up before it even starts. I’ve been using this for 3+ years now and love it. I also enjoy his other products and do see me choosing another cleaners unless this discontinued.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,Great for Oily Acne Skin,"I have very oily acne prone skin and this is the only cleanser I will use. I like that it has Farnesol which helps fight acne-causing bacteria and alpha and beta hydroxy acids that gently exfoliate. My skin feels clean after each use and I notice it does take care of the little blackheads on my nose. My skin doesn't feel tight though. I've committed to the entire DDG regimen for my skin type. I use this, the extra-strength peel, the retinol serum, Alpha Beta Moisturizer and the Lightweight Sunscreen. My skin feels smooth and healthy."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,breaks out skin,"I love Dr. Dennis Gross’s products, but this is not it for me. This cleansing gel made me break out and did not improve my skin at all for a month. I’ll stick to my tatcha cleanser and Curology. I love my other products by this brand though, this was just a huge miss for me!"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Alpha Beta AHA/BHA Cleansing Gel,USA,get it clean,"This cleanser is amazing, leaves your skin clean and you can tell by your pores they get cleaned, if you have black heads you can tell the difference. Its better if you pair it with a face brush cleanser."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Singapore,Drunk El Jelly Cleanser 60ml,"My first impression of this cleanser was that it did the job—my skin felt clean, and it didn't interfere with other products. Packaging was super cute."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Pass this up,I really wanted to love this product after hearing such great reviews on it but I was left unimpressed. The consistency of the product is nice and I liked it most when I lathered the product before putting it on my face. I didn’t have good results using the product. My skin began over producing oil after a week of using this. It isn’t worth the money for me.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Malaysia,My Fave Cleanser!,This is my repurchase and reason being it suits my skin. I have dry skin but oily at times with the fact that I stay in a tropical country. This gel type cleanser do clean my skin very well without drying my skin.

DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,It's an okay cleanser,"I got the free trial size. I would say it's an okay cleanser, didn't get a sense that anything special was happening when cleaning my skin. The smell is okay. Wouldn't buy it."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,it’s fine,"makes my skin feel clean without drying me out. love the way my skin feels after using it and it does not break me out. cons: does not take off makeup well and has a weird smell, in my opinion."

DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Singapore,dries out the skin,"this product dries out the skin. after cleaning the face, the face feels too tight in a negative way. my skin is the dry type. I'm using the face shop / clinique / tatcha now and they work better. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Using this for over 3 years!!,"I have used this product for 3 years at least. I have literally tried everything on the market (I used to have cystic acne, still prone to acne), and this is the only cleanser that is gentle, unscented, doesnt dry out my skin, and doesn't cause acne flare ups. Its such a solid face wash (this is my first review ever so I rlly took time out of my day to type this). I dont care for other DE products but this is the best."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Love!,Absolutely love this cleanser! My skin is extremely dry and allergy prone and I have had no issues with this product. Gentle and effective!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Best cleanser I’ve tried so far,Skin feels amazing afterwards - not too drying and a little goes a long way! Would definitely recommend :)
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Malaysia,Nice product,Used it already and it was nice! Love drunk elephant but it’s quite pricey. It is not really the best but not really the worst face wash I’ve ever used. I think most people can opt for much more affordable face wash.

DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,"I found this product to be quite average. I had no qualms with it in particular, I just did not notice any difference in my skin after using it. I feel as though you could use a similar if not better cleanser for half of the price and achieve the same results."

DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Great cleanser for sensitive acne prone skin!,"Great cleanser, one of the few cleansers that work for sensitive acne prone skin which is a difficult combo for obvious reasons. Used this cleanser for a year or so and it’s done wonders for my skin. Definitely need an exfoliating peel or treatment once a week though but otherwise this is great"

DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,don’t buy if you have sensitive dry skin,"broke me out & totally dried out my skin, for the price you’d think it’d be worth it"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Terribly drying,"I'm not sure why others rave so much about it but personally my combination skin hates it - it dries it out making it feel and look much worse. Should be named as ""Enemy no.9""."

DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Hardcore Love!,"This love story is early in the making, and the honeymoon isn't over yet, but so far, this cleanser is a keeper! My skin is super-finicky and has ultra-high standards when it comes to finding compatible partners - like cleansers that rinse clean without making my face red, exfoliating toners and serums that don't make my pigmentation worse, and moisturizers that don't clog my pores. You could say my skin is a total diva! I took a sample of this cleanser cabin-camping with me for a week, and WOW, people! This little elephant delivers! My previously rashy skin with T-Zone breakouts is now so smooth and supple that I've been leaving my house without makeup. It's the only thing I changed about my daily skincare routine, and it's paying off in spades! I start my routine by removing SPF and makeup with micellar water, followed by this cleanser. Then I use Paula's Choice Niacinamide Booster (green + white bottle), La Roche Posay Tolerene Fluid, and ZO SPF Primer. This cleanser is key! I love that this line carries small, experience sizes before committing. I also love that they help elephants!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,I have combo skin sometimes dry lol,nice cleancer very soft and nice after every wash I will definitely  purchase again

I have normal to oily skin/ sensitive and omg this takes away the oilness on my skin without making it dry. I got a little sample of this years ago and I loved it so much I had to buy again. Been using this since. Removes make up like a charm! Love love love! Totally recommend.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,"I LOVE THIS CLEANSER SO MUCH. I’ve used it for a while now on and off and somehow always end up purchasing this one whenever I need a cleanser again. My skin has changed a lot, I like how it’s not too heavy after you use it. Doesn’t make my skin feel dry or anything! Looks super refreshing after washing it off as well."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Surprisingly effective face wash,"This cleanser was very surprising. I only used this cleanser and a basic moisturizer, no toner or serum, and my skin became very smooth after a few days of using it. I only used it at night and when I saw the difference it reinforced me to continue washing my face at night cuz I always get lazy at night. So, I really liked this cleanser and I would buy it again to get rid of any texture. It smells weird though like cantaloupe."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Love!,"got this from the littles set! I had dry, flakey and red skin around the bottom of my nose and about 1 week after use it was gone!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,10/10 recommend!,i got this product with a set a few weeks ago. i had redness and dry flakey skin around my nose on the bottom section. 1 week after using it looked as if it was never there! it also is amazing for my sensitive skin! there is a slight scent and it hasn’t affected my skin so far!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,LOVE LOVE LOVE 10/10,"I have been using the Jelly Cleanser ever since I got a sample 3 years ago. It is a great gentle face wash that does not dry out my skin, in turn my oily skin has almost disappeared. (If that makes sense)  I recommend this to all my friends and family."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Singapore,It was alright ,"Overrated cleanser. Bought it for its ability to remove makeup, but I think its role in doing that was just meh. It cleanses your face without any tight feeling on your face though!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,love love love it!,I've been using this cleanser for a few years now and absolutely love it! It does a great job of removing grease and everything else and leaves your skin feeling smooth and moisturized. You only need to use a pea size amount so although it may seem expensive it's not actually in the long run because it will literally last you a year! love love love it!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Malaysia,Good cleanser ,"I got this because I want to try all this brand. It has this gel texture and it cleans my face well without feeling tight after washing my face. It does its job of cleaning my face. But I might not repurchase this one. Overall, good experience! "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,NOPE,YUCK.. idk what on earth this goop is supposed to do ... clog the shower maybe? Squeeze itself out of the bottle ?  My sweet little son bought this without telling me in an earnest attempt to take care of his beautiful little face ...Poor kid ..I returned it and he is smitten with amorepacific cleaning powder .  Dont waste your money it did not work for him.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,My Favorite Cleanser!!,This cleanser is amazing! It’s gentle on my skin but still gives a good clean. It has done wonders for reducing redness and texture! This is the second time I’ve repurchased and I want to try more from this brand!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Singapore,love. ,1st time trying out a drunk elephant cleanser after hearing alot of good things about the brand. i  love how it made my skin feel all clean. it leaves no film on the skin and doesn't dehyrate it. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Singapore,One of my go to’s,"Great cleanser - get it right - cleans till your nose is squeaky but doesn’t leave you dry - no fragrance and does not react badly with any other of my products 
one star off for the price - bit more expensive than other cleansers that do the same thing 
recommend a large lump value pack to be more worth it 
"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Singapore,Best cleanser ever!,"I am a huge fan of Drunk Elephant. Initially i bought the mini version of this to try, it left my skin squeaky clean.. 
love it so decided to get the big version. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,"Works so well on my sensitive skin, haven’t used it long enough to see about acne spots though"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,It cleaned my skin nicely but I did not feel it enhanced it in any way. It is doubtful that I would buy it again.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,great for oily/acne-prone skin used in rotation,"I have combination acne prone skin that tends toward oily, especially on my T-zone. This gel cleanser foams up nicely and it doesn’t run into and sting the eyes. It does what it says in that it thoroughly removes impurities and build up from the day, but just don’t expect it to be your every time every day cleanser. They even recommend not using a cleanser in the AM if you used this in the PM so as to not strip your barrier and make your skin overly dry (but I always cleanse both AM and PM due to my acne prone skin). 

My routine right now is to use Cetaphil or ProDerm gentle cleanser in the am and apply serums and moisturizing sunscreen. Then I use this in the PM with my Foreo Luna. If it’s been a really long day or I know my face is really dirty from sweat or I’ve actually worn makeup for once, I’ll double cleanse with DHC oil cleanser in the evening to loosen and push out dirt from clogged pores before using this. 

Overall, this is my second mini and I’m very happy having this in my cleanser rotation. It’s always a good idea to have a thorough cleanser in the mix."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Good cleanser.,"I definitely had high hopes for this cleanser. It works great for me currently, but I don't think I will be repurchasing. The texture is hard to describe. On skin that is not completely dripping the cleanser feels very odd. It gets the job done and I like it, but I don't think it lives up to the price. I would recommend this cleanser as it is good, but I personally think there are better cleansers."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,"Decent cleanser, but smell is a little strange!","I’ve heard many good things about DE, so I decided to try one of their most mild formulations with this cleanser. 

The cleansing aspect of it is great! It leaves no film on the skin and doesn’t dehydrate at all. 

The only downside or negative I see about it is I find the scent to be strange. It smells like chemicals and it smells a bit too sour for me. 

Also, please make sure it goes nowhere near your eyes! I scrubbed over my eyebrow and when I rinsed, some of the water got into my eye and it was horribly painful for about twenty minutes. 

Overall, I would buy it again despite its cons."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,I love this cleanser! It worked fantastic with my eyelash extensions and does great for removing my make up!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,"It's okay at removing makeup, but it breaks me out terribly every time I've used it. So it's a no for me."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Not what I hoped.,"I used this consistently for a whole bottle and a half, I did not change any of my other products at the time. I noticed my skin had increased sensitivity and redness. I was highly disappointed."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,"Had really high hopes for this. It broke me out within days of using it and is not good at removing makeup, but it is unscented which I do appreciate"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,just okay,"It’s just “okay” for me. I have oily, acne/hormonal skin. This was oddly recommended to me by a worker."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Malaysia,it makes even the thickest of makeup go bye bye,"I use this only when i wear a heavier makeup cause using this too much may make your skin dry. It doesn’t feel dry if you wash it once a day, suggest to do it at the end pf the day and just toner the morning after "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,"I did not like this cleanser. Hated the smell, and how it felt on my skin. I woke up with blemishes on my skin after using. Overpriced for a basic cleanser aswell."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Buy this! try the sample size first.,"Love this gentle cleanser. Feels so good during and after use. Skin feels soft, hydrated, and fully cleansed!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,BESTE IS THE WORSTE!!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Needed a cleanser to fully remove sunscreen so tried this two nights in a row. After the first night I noticed some tiny blemishes coming up under my skin. Waking up after the second use, I can confirm that this broke me all around my jaws and chin. Just when my skin was looking clear and smooth. In the garbage it went!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Malaysia,Plain,"definitely fragrance free, i felt this cleanser is so simple and plain. nothing special It cleanse well but that just it. nothing else. better option out there"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Singapore,Other better cleansers out there,"Bought into the DE hype, but tbh this is a veryyy average cleanser. My personal go to is Philosophy’s Purity. For reference i have an oily-combo skin. This product is good but not great."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,"My go to cleaner, I was surprised by all the mediocre reviews, I find this cleanser does an excellent job of taking off makeup even stubborn eye makeup. But doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry or tight. Plus you just need a drop to cleanse your face so it lasts a long time."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Mediocre,"Did nothing special to help my dry, blemish prone skin, so I will not purchase for the price."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,My face hasn’t been so clean in years!,"I love this cleanser, it isn’t as foamy as I usually like but one use and I was a convert. Safe for use on eyes, no stinging and removes stubborn mascara with ease. Rinses clean and my face feels so soft, smooth and squeaky clean but without tightness! Not sure I can use anything else from here on out. All other face washes are in the trash bin. Recommended!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,You need to buy this!!!,I love this product so much! It is a great product! It probably lasted about two months and was so worth the price! I will buy this again!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,"It leaks sooooo much. Even tho it is closed. It’s ridiculous. Even when it is on my sink, idk how it is possible"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,good but I would try something else,Okay soooo I purchased this a year ago and still have a little left in bottle and I use this 1-2 times daily! I just use a very small amount you really don’t need very much. For that reason this is a steal. The quality of this I feel could have been better it is a very light gentle cleanser. I don’t think I will re purchase this though just for the fact I felt my face feel not as deep cleaned as I would like. I think I prefer the purity cleanser instead of this one or something else to that gives a more intense cleanse feel.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Not sure why Drunk Elephant is so expensive,The texture of this is gross & it didn’t remove my makeup very well.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,"Tried a small size of this. Overall, I like it. Not too drying. I prefer the Fresh one though."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,underrated,"I’m confused about all the mixed reviews. I love to travel with this cleanser and it’s also what I keep in my sink. (I prefer a pump in the shower).

This is a great everyday cleanser as it’s gentle and always leaves my skin feeling hydrated. It also does a great job removing eye make ups when I don’t want to use a cleansing oil first and doing all the additional steps. Again my skin is left feeling smooth and hydrated. 

I always gravitate to this as there seems to be so many cleansers out there that strip ur skin and everything now has some sort of peel or acid.

This is now my 3rd tube"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,This really irritated my combo skin. It felt tight after use and my redness came right out.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,"i honestly did not like this cleanser at all! it all it did was break me out & nothing more than that, i gave combo oily skin as well but at the time my face was drying out due to an acne medicine (not acutance) & the dry weather."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Singapore,omg i SUPER love this,ok. ok so i tried  the mini one and loved it. contemplated for months to purchase this and finally did. guys! i used like 5 different really expensive cleansers and this was my fav! i used fresh khiels tatcha pixi and more but this one just so good. granted it's expensive but give it a try! 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Nice cleanser,This is a gentle cleanser and compact. I would buy it again.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Singapore,Not sure about this,I have purchased it a few times but still not sure if I love it. It cleanses alright but does not do anything else. May repurchase till I find something better.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Above Average,"ok so i sued this product for about 2-3 years 
amazing for removing makeup 
soft on the skin
but I didn't realize how dull my skin was until I changed my cleanser"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Hydrates/Perfect for Sensitive skin/No breakouts,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Don’t know what’s in this product but this has bin my 5th repurchase as well has the (Drunk Elephant polypeptide cream) 
The Jelly cleanser after using it, my face has not broken out and I have very sensitive skin! Also made the texture of face super soft after washing! Super hydrating for a cleanser. I live in Canada so the dryness is real! Buy it! You won’t regret it trust me!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,Love this face wash. Since I’ve started using it over a year ago it’s been one of my go to’s. ( youth to the people and murad are my other go to’s)
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,"Super gentle cleanser, didn’t irritate my skin! Can’t wait to repurchase!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Singapore,I'm loving it,"After using it, face felt cleansed and yet moisterised. doesn't stripe the skin of hydration. am loving it despite only started using it for less than a week!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Malaysia,the best fash wash!,This is the best fash wash so far after i change about 10 fash wash. However the price is about pricey and its always out of stock. Really smooth on skin and dont have any weird smell
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,Received this as a gift for christmas. It dries out my skin and is nothing special. I wouldn’t spend my hard earned money on this.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,"Decent, but left my skin SUPER dry and tight after","Gentle while in the shower and didn’t cause me any extra breakouts, and cleared my skin when I had spots. Leaves my skin feeling extremely dry and tight as soon as it starts to dry after I get out of the shower though. If I don’t immediately heavily moisturize while my face is still damp, my face is in SOO much pain. Might be better for people with really oil skin. My skin is usually combo, but since using this cleanser it’s been so much more dry and flaky, especially under my foundation, even with slugging and heavy moisturizing. Definitely dries me out. This size doesn’t last very long as a daily cleanser, obviously. Purchased on Feb 4th, used a pea-dime sized amount once or twice daily, and has lasted me til March 18th."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Worse breakout ever!,When I first got this I loved it and felt really clean. Going on 3 months and I have never been so broken out!!! I have really deep awful pimples that never seem to go away! Gentle cleanser at first but has destroyed my skin in the last few months unfortunately. Switching to something else.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Philippines,I love this and it’s cruelty free ,"If I can only use one facial wash then this is it. I have tried a lot of facial wash like tata harper, dr dennis gross, fresh, cosrx, etc but this is the OG. It’s like an all in one cleanser. My skin type is combo/acne prone. I use sunscreen everyday and even with makeup it can remove all that gunk. I love it and it’s cruelty free heart heart"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Balance,I have oily skin and love a great gel cleanser. I was pleasantly surprised that this effectively cleans skin but doesn’t strip it. My skin felt clean and hydrated even before applying my skincare routine. It never has led to breakouts and keeps everything balanced. I’m buying another tube!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,It’s the best cleanser you need it leaves my skin clean soft I tried so many cleansers before no one gave me this results as I have a very dry skin I’ll definitely will buy it again
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,"I love this cleanser, it’s my every day cleanser. It’s super simple and has no fragrance which is important to me with sensitive skin. Cerave is also something I tried for my skin but that made me breakout. This is the only one that does the job for me! My only problem is the packaging. If you shut the lid too fast, the nozzle cracks and then when you place it on the counter, the product leaks out. Further, if you store your cleanser in the shower like I do, water will runs over the bottle and the water gets trapped inside the cap! So if it’s cracked water will get inside the bottle and makes the product super runny. It is my favorite cleanser and I just try to take care while using it so I don’t waste any."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,Been using this cleanser for over a year and recently ran out but i never noticed how well it works compared to other ones i have. ive been breaking out since i havent used this cleanser in a month now. super excited to have my go to cleanser back and how fast it works with getting rid of all my imperfections!   it is a bit drying if you have dry skin like me but nothing moisturizer cant fix!!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Malaysia,Jelly cleanser,"Love this face wash. Its fragrance free and left my face feeling squeaky clean. Its has really helped with the oiliness, i can't believe how good my skin is looking and feeling. I will definitely recommending it to everyone"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,I had shied away from this to find a cheaper product but failed and ventured back. This product cleanses skin without drying out my sensitive skin
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Great gentle cleanser!,"Love this cleanser!  It’s not harsh or drying at all, it just leaves my skin clean and soft!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,"Great non-drying, unscented cleanser!","I love this cleanser for the fact that it doesn't contain perfume. It is unscented, cleans great, and doesn't dry out your skin.  Definitely worth the price!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,This was way too drying and harsh on my skin. I recommend putting very moisturizing products on after using this. I didn’t use this as an every day face cleanser after the first few uses because of how intense it was on my skin. To use up the product I used this when my skin really needed a deep clean.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Pretty Great,"I am a huge fan of this brand and biased in always looking to like the products. I do believe that they are generally great. This cleaner is pretty good. I love removing makeup with cleaner and it’s a must in my routine to have a cleaner that removed my mascara, eyeliner, and whatever else. This certainly does the job. The only complain is that it can sting your eyes quite a bit which is a problem if you are using it to remove mascara. I am certain if my way of removing makeup if the best for my eyes or lashes but it is a routine I am comfortable with. All in all, very good, does what promised and the travel size is excellent for vacations. I will keep trying others just to see what’s out there butI would repurchase if nothing better comes along."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,"I waited so long to write a review on this product. Bought this product on 07/22/21 and used the last bit of this product on 01/25/22. I have dry sensitive acne prone skin. I’ve only used this in the evening to cleanse my face and just water in the morning since I have dry skin. This product is very gentle and I really recommend this to anyone with any sort of skin issues. As you can see in the picture, it forms a very nice lather. I have used so many cleansers including Vanicream and I’d prefer this over anything else. It didn’t bother my dry skin at all and after cleansing I always follow up with an essence. Unlike Biossance cleanser, this has no fragrance at all. Overall, great product that last a long time. Very well worth your money."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,removes makeup so well,Removed every trace of makeup without double cleansing and made my skin feel hydrated after. Love this stuff!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,"This is my favorite cleanser I’ve tried. It’s super light weight on your face and washes off smoothly. As stated on the bottle, it can be used on a dry or wet face which makes it super easy to use this without any hassle or mess. It washes off my makeup well enough, but sometimes I’ll still have mascara left under my eyes. This cleanser leaves my skin feeling super soft and hydrated. I love that it’s composed of clean ingredients too."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,My holy grail cleanser!,"If I could give this 100 stars I would! I previously used the Pekee bar by DE until I used it all up and decided to try Rihanna’s cleanser. I gave Riri a chance but my skin just never felt clean and i had a lot of sebum build up. I tried this and My skin felt AMAZING after one use! It has a very very mild scent and is moisturizing yet leaves your skin feeling so clean at the same time. I am purging just a little bit because of the buildup from using the other product that did nothing for me but I can see the difference in my pores. No sebum build up, just soft supple skin. A little goes a long way too. 100/10."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,"I've never been one to get excited about cleansers, but this one got me excited! I initially purchased it when my skin was extremely sensitive and dry, and it was absolutely incredible: you get a feeling of really clean skin as well as a feeling of hydration. Absolutely no stripping sensation. I've since repurchased and will keep repurchasing. Highly recommend!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,"I received this as a free sample with another DE product purchase and decided to give it a try. I love the cleanser and have since purchased a full size, however the price is a little expensive. I do love how gentle it is with my sensitive skin and I have noticed how well it pairs with other DE products."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,"Solid Cleanser, Nothing to Rave About...","The Good: This is a solid cleanser, I've bought the large size after getting a few samples a while back. I believe it's best suited as a gentle morning cleanser, emphasis on the gentle. This will not give you a deep-pore type of clean feeling by any means. The smell is honestly best comparable to the smell of honeydew melon or cantaloupe, not the artificial kind but the smell of the fresh fruit being sliced. I quite enjoy it and oftentimes tag-a-long the minis (which usually come in DE larger sets) on my travels with my as a morning/day cleanser. This is true to it's name, it really is a gel-like consistency but it's not a thick/chunky kind of ""jelly"" either. 

The Bad: Okay, I must preface I do enjoy this product but it is quite drying. For a jelly cleanser, one would usually expect a little bit more hydration. You aren't going to get that. It's not an exaggerated type of drying and it's nothing a little moisturizer or oil doesn't fix which usually come after the cleanser anyways, but it was slightly off-putting to me when I first tried the cleanser a while back. The rests (to me, personally) are nothing to really rave about. When I really love a product I talk about it with friends/family but I can't recall me every mentioning or recommending this to anyone. It's simply not a ""memorable"" type of cleanser. ""Nothing to rave about"" so-to-speak.

The Ugly/Honest: Even though I have purchased the large size previously, I have not (and will not) be buying it again. I'm fine with only getting the minis in my DE sets and using them for travel. It's not a bad cleanser, but there's so much better out there. I love Drunk Elephant and I can safely say this is not one of their best products by any means."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Canada,drying,the packaging n stuff is cute but it just made my skin feel dried out ? i saw a lot of reviews saying it felt hydrating but that was not the case at all for me lol
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,I've been using this for a couple years now. I really like it. It's light and cleanses well and it doesn't dry out your skin. I also think it does a good job of removing makeup so you don't need to use a separate makeup remover.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser - 150ml,"This well balanced cleanser leaves skin fresh, without makeup or skincare and gives improves texture. It’s a pleasure to use as very refreshing and works well"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Beste™ No. 9 Jelly Cleanser,Singapore,Solid product!,I've tried 2 cleansers from Drunk Elephant and both worked really well! My makeup always comes off easily and my skin feels incredibly smooth and soft after using. I have sensitive skin and it never irritates me. Very reliable product and I will continue buying for sure!
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Purifying Gel Cleanser,Malaysia,A must have for oily & acne skin,If you have oily & acne prone skin you will know the struggle is real! So anything that helps improve this skin situation gets my vote for sure. Best used with a Foreo for better application & spread.
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Purifying Gel Cleanser,Malaysia,pretty cool ,"Removes oil off face, makes face feel smooth, smells good but not sure if any fragrance is added 
and fresh after wash. would buy again and also good for the environment "
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Purifying Gel Cleanser,Singapore,HOLY GRAIL Cleanser,"I love love love this product!
For past months I've been struggling with
broken skin barrier, redness appear, skin
peeled, and itchy skin. I did some research on
gentle cleanser that can also cure redness,
luckily I found this and I've never love a
cleanser as much as I love this cleanser.
There's a cool sensation when I'm using it so l
feel refreshed, it also super gentle and doesn't
trigger any redness to my skin, the smell is also
super good like fresh grape but better. If you've
been eyeing on this one, I suggest you to give
it a try. I can't guarantee, but if you have same
concern as I did, I think you'll love it <3"

I recommend double cleansing no matter what cleanser you may use. I bought this because ran out cleaners from Nip & Fab which is brilliant, bought this as a temporary solution while I wait to restock my usual from nip & fab but ended up buying this twice. It’s gentle, didn’t give me any negative affect and works just fine. I do break out so I specifically looked for a cleanser that can help, and this works very well. I use it with the combination of the face mask. "

CAUDALIE-Vinopure Purifying Gel Cleanser,Australia,Best cleanser,This cleanser is great for oily combination skin. It does need a double cleanse to remove all makeup but otherwise it’s great. Does not leave the skin dry or tight. 
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Purifying Gel Cleanser,Singapore,Not suitable for me,"I bought this along with other products from the vinopure range. First impression is the lovely minty smell, it rinses off well to give a clean after-feel. I've been wanting to try out a gel cleanser that has salicylic acid in it due to my breakout prone skin. However, I do think it dries out my combination skin more than I like. I'm in my 40s, have combination sensitive skin and breakout prone. I have used another french brand which has a better formulation, not drying, for a similar product. I'm afraid this product is not suitable for me. Would suit someone with oilier skin."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Purifying Gel Cleanser,Singapore,Ms,"I love it so far! The scent of it is a bit strong which I don’t really mind, and it feels light on my skin but still cleanses quite well. The only thing is that it seems to be running out REALLY fast? I’m using fairly little of it at a time but it still seems to be finishing so fast 😭"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Purifying Gel Cleanser,Singapore,essential oil scent too strong ,The scent of the essential oil is overpowering. Gel formula thicker than many other gel cleansers I have tried and I prefer a lighter gel texture. It’s a purifying cleanser but it does not strip my skin. I don’t think it’s a bad product it just doesn’t suit me 
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Purifying Gel Cleanser,Singapore,1st try on this product. ,Someone recommended me to try this product and I never regretted it. facial wash that didn't make my skin feel dry. It's great for sensitive skin. the smell just so therapeutic. Just love this product.

CAUDALIE-Vinopure Purifying Gel Cleanser,Philippines,Love this cleanser sooo much!,"There’s a reason why Caudalie products are a cult favorite. I wish I’ve known about Caudalie before (I’m in my late 20s).

Finding products that work for me has always been a challenge - I have acne-prone sensitive skin, and I have large pores, too. I have oily skin and living in a tropical country really takes its toll on my skin. But this product successfully controlled the oil production in my T-zone! I don’t use oil-blotting paper frequently now, unlike before. It also minimized my pores! The product really delivers its promise. I love the scent, too. Will definitely repurchase."

He has oily skin, large pores and occasional breakouts. Wow did this line work for him! I’m actually jealous how much it has cleared up his skin and evened out his tone. One star off for the fact that Claudalie still sells to stores in China where animal testing is required. "
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Purifying Gel Cleanser,Singapore,Bad Bad Bad,"I don’t understand why people are so hyped for this brand. Not for me and my cousin’s skin. Caused breakouts after using it for a week.

"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle Eye And Lip Makeup Remover,Malaysia,not great,"Smells horrid, and it’s not as effective as others of the same category from different drugstore brands, and those cost less. I usually only need to use these types of removers prior to cleansing when I wear glitter around the eyes (I worry the chunky glitter might cause skin abrasions around the eyes if directly removed with cleansing balms). I’d even purposely go out of my way to use this, and more than necessary(instead of my usual cleansing balms on days I don’t have glitter on) just to finish it off ASAP."

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle Eye And Lip Makeup Remover,Australia,Good purchase,"Honestly not that bad, I have very sensitive eyes and I haven’t reacted only when I accidentally got it in my eye! That hurt quite a bit but obvious it isn’t meant to go there "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle Eye And Lip Makeup Remover,Australia,works well,Gentle and not irritating on my skin. Removes makeup with ease. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle Eye And Lip Makeup Remover,Australia,Not worth it ,"I usually use bioderma micellar water for my face & Neutrogena lips & eye makeup remover for my eye makeup, which often includes waterproof mascara. Thought I'd give this one a try instead of the neutrogena. Absolutely did nothing to my mascara, the micellar water actually worked better than this and felt better for my skin. I don't recommend it. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle Eye And Lip Makeup Remover,Malaysia,ideal product ,"I really like to use this product pairing on my eyes and lip with Sephora make up remover on my face. Ideal on any eye makeup I wear. I use liquid, cream, power and glitters or shimmer eye shadows and same lip products. This product is effective on all types. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle Eye And Lip Makeup Remover,Malaysia,makeup remover,Hurm not really good. I was expecting more… its not easy to remove makeup. I have to use a lot of it to get my makeup removed. No gonna purchase again..

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle Eye And Lip Makeup Remover,Singapore,it works,"Bought this in store, staff recommended it. I had some irritation to my eye lids when I used Biore wipes, so the staff recommended I use this to remove eye make up instead and it works. It’s oily tho, I guess that’s why it works."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle Eye And Lip Makeup Remover,Singapore,not fantastic ,Was recommended by SP salesperson for removing eye makeups. I don’t have heavy thick makeup yet I need to use lots of this to clean just my waterproof mascara. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle Eye And Lip Makeup Remover,New Zealand,Gentle Eye and Lip Makeup Remover,"I was excited to try this product, but unfortunately it disappointed slightly. I bought the smallest size to try and it didn’t last long at all - not very cost effective. I really liked the consistency of this face wash however I wish it would have lathered more so it could go further. Lovely smell and soothing chamomile, felt good when applied on skin. However this really STRUGGLED to remove my mascara (non waterproof) even after cleansing and reapplying multiple times. If this removed makeup more easy I would probably repurchase but unfortunately I won’t be."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle Eye And Lip Makeup Remover,Malaysia,good,"sephora branding never dissapointed,,,,,,,same as premium brand level,,,,,,remove make up easily and feel clean.....so far using this never left any dirt....."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle Eye And Lip Makeup Remover,Singapore,Packaging problem?,"A little disappointed with this product. Although it is supposed to be more gentle for sensitive eyes, I still feel that it stings my eyes a little upon use. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle Eye And Lip Makeup Remover,Philippines,okay to use,"I used this to remove my foundation,blush on and mascara. It’s easy and okay to use though the texture is gel and not liquid so you need to put more to remove your make up. But over all it’s okay for me."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle Eye And Lip Makeup Remover,Philippines,okay,bought this as a christmas present for my mom along with the gentle eye makeup remover. i think she likes it. nothing too fancy as the bottle is just small and great for travelling 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle Eye And Lip Makeup Remover,Philippines,Does the job,"Got this for free during the BF sale. Certainly does the job without ripping you off. Will buy a bigger size next time. Works well with my skin, no irritation or allergy."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle Eye And Lip Makeup Remover,Singapore,Good but packaging has a design flaw,"This is a thick and viscous makeup remover - and as it says, really gentle on the eyes. The reason I didn't give it full five stars was because of the packaging. The opening of the bottle is way too small and you literally have to shake it like maracas just to get the liquid out. Not a major deal breaker but still slightly annoying."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,New Zealand,LOVE,"LOVE this stuff. Love all things fenty if I’m honest. But love this stuff. It is so creamy and smells so nice and leaves your skin feeling moisturised but doesn’t strip your skin of oils. It even gets the make up off would you believe it. I double cleanse so I do a cleansing balm and then this. I have no negative comments about this. Oh and it’s massive, lasts you ages. Go get it "
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Malaysia,refreshing!,"really love the way it feels on my skin, so hydrating, subtle smell and feels luxurious too! i have a normal-oily and sometimes combination the way i see it, and it has been a wonder! really help for double cleansing."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,New Zealand,Best cleanser ,Cleans off makeup thoroughly and maintains daily freshness. Love this cleanser and the tube is so functional. It is almost impossible to use too much abd doesn't leak when travelling. 
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Singapore,Repeat buy,"This is my second purchase!!! Good for after removing makeup! Just that it leaves my face a litle dry! But I still use it until finish because girl, it’s fenty. "
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,It's a keeper!,I've been using this product for a while now and it has done wonders for my skin (normal-oily). It has a really nice texture to enjoy while cleansing and a little goes a long way!
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,Perfect Cleanser,"Honestly, such a perfect cleanser. It leaves the skin feeling smooth, and thoroughly clean. Removes all my makeup & deeply cleans while leaving my sensitive skin soft, glowy & cleansed."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Canada,Would buy again. Favorite cleanser in the shower.,"I love this. Scent is great, yogurt-like smell and the packaging is clean. Can't get enough of this!"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Singapore,Make up cleanser ,"The fragrance just makes your face smell so fresh. You would just feel like washing it again and again. 

Doesn't damage or repair your skin, in my opinion. 

But it is a great make up remover! It washes off every bit of make up. Rub soap on make, use little water to foam it up, let it sit for a few seconds and wash it. Make up comes off completely. "
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Singapore,Make up remover ,"Smells so great. It removes all my make up products in one wash. 
However, it did not really help in reducing my acne nor did it help it any other way for my skin concerns. Did not do damage either. 
I wouldn't mind purchasing it as my make up cleanser when they have a good sale for this product. "
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,Smooth,I have been using this cleanser from part 8 months. it smells delicious and cleans face leaving soft skin. It is very gentle on skin and also helps removing make-up.
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,"smells great, works great ","works great as a 3-4 times weekly cleanser on sensitive skin, helped (with a basic cleanser) clear up my acne prone skin with consistent use. smells amazing and last for ages. on my second rebuy after about 1.5 years. would buy again."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Singapore,ok,Very strong scent but I love how glowy it is. I will definitely repurchase and recommend this is they come up with the unscented version because the smell is off putting as I have sensitive skin 
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,Favourite Cleanser ,"After many years of searching for the perfect cleanser, I have finally found it! The right thickness that foams up nicely when mixed with water to remove oils, makeup reminisce and cleanse the skin  Love the pink colour too. "
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Canada,Not a makeup remover,"I like it as a facial cleanser, it doesn't leave the skin dry, but it's a horrible makeup remover. It actually doesn't remove makeup at all. I always have concealer gathered up under my eye because it doesn't melt the makeup away, it just moves it around your face."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,nice easy cleanser,"Nice and basic cleanser, foams up the right amount and feels nice to use. Not too harsh on my normal type skin, feels well balanced and better than other makeup removers that can feel too harsh.  

I also really like the tube it comes in, seems well designed with the twist lid, good for dispensing not too much product."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,"simple, gorgeous cleanser","such a simple, beautiful cleanser. a little expensive but so worth it. makes the skin so soft and clean. totally in love with it. lathers up nicely and doesn’t make the skin feel weird after using "

FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Malaysia,smell like bubblegum,I love this cleanser because it does cleans my face without drying unlike my previous hada labo cleanser. 2 pump and it will lather the whole face. Repurchase ? Definitely . 
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Canada,Feel in love with this product,"Love ,love and love this product. It's really moisturizes skin and after your face looks fresh."

FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,good stuff,"I love this cleanser. 
I've never had any break outs or irritations from it and a little goes a long way so you really get moneys worth.
not strongly fragranced either "
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,New Zealand,best cleanser ever ,"So so good. You will not regret trying it out. A little goes a long way, nice and light, subtle lovely smell. Will never buy a different cleanser. Lovely bottle "
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,Farnaz ,"Love it love it love it, I will buy it again as makes my skin look so soft and clean,also smells great when you put on your skin. You should try it on. "
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Malaysia,my second purchase,"I have been using this for a while now and I think it is doing its job . My skin is smooth, really healthy really glow. I would definitely buy more in the future because it is worth it.
"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Singapore,MY GO TO CLEANSER!,I tried these and ordinary. Work wonders for me for both. I love it! Both same price and both suits my sensitive skin! Ive been using this for almost 4 months!!!!!
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Singapore,"Love Rihanna and Fenty, but did not love this","I’ve used a lot of different facial cleansers and this performed quite badly when compared to the rest of them. As stated above, I love Fenty and Rihanna, but this failed to meet my expectations or the product’s promise. When I used it on my face at the end of the day without first using a makeup remover, there would be traces of makeup on my skin after using this cleanser.

That doesn’t mean that it’s a bad cleanser… It just means it doesn’t “remove it all” from your skin. If you want to get a one product to do both, I would redirect your attention to Fresh instead. "
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,Great for combo skin! Love it,"I’ve been using this product for 3 months now, I bought the travel size first to try it and I am loving it. I have a combo skin type and it has significantly improved my oily areas without drying my face out. I really like the how my face feels after using it and definitely will continue to include it in my routine!"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Canada,My go to,"My go to. Tried the mini with the phat water and I was obsessed. I love the way it smells too, and it helped maintained the clarity of my skin."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,Great product,"I like this a lot. It is very very thick, the thickest cleanser I’ve ever used￼. So it’s a bit different. But it’s super effective at removing makeup & dirt. I would consider purchasing the full size version."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Singapore,Love it!,"I love it! I bought the small bottle to try on and see the results. Since my makeup is quite light (e.g. Eyeliner, concealer, blush and lips), it does remove it quite nicely and it makes my skin feels nice. Probably this will not be suitable for those who are sensitive to fragrance cleansers but for me I like it. + the bottle is really eco friendly too!"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,The best cleanser for all skin types,I have combination skin and have found it so tricky to get a good cleanser that takes off everything without drying me out or leaving me oily. This is handsdown my favourite cleanser. Used it for years. I found it also really helped to clear up my acne as a teenager and keeps blemishes away whilst also being a great product for removing make-up. 10/10 recommend!
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Singapore,Great for Travels and for light makeup,This is an amazing product! It washes away my makeup and leaves no residue. My skin is clean yet not dry or tight. A little goes a long way! Use only a little cleanser and lather well with a little water in your hands first. *Make sure your facial skin is also wet before rubbing the lathered cleanser on your face. I will surely re-purchase as I was looking high and low for a cleanser that also totally removes makeup without drying the skin. 
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Canada,Dispenser needs work,The product itself is a 10/10. Super gentle and effective cleanser at a good price point. A little goes a long way therefore the bottle lasts a long time. My only complaint is that the dispensing system is not my favourite as the bottle gets to about half full it’s harder and harder to dispense from the twist top cap. Would prefer a pump top or an easier squeeze bottle as the twist cap makes it difficult to dispense.
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Canada,Go to cleanser,"I love this cleanser. It doesn’t dry out my skin, and the packaging is cute with the twist cap. Will definitely be buying again once I’m out!"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,Must have,"I started using this product line a year ago, it has done wonders for my skin. I love it!!!!!"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,I constantly restock this product!,"I'm on my 3rd bottle of this and will never hesitate to rebuy. My skin always feels soft and not dry after washing my face & the best part is that it actually does remove all makeup -- even those annoying waterproof products just make sure your massaging it in. There is a slight fragrance but it isn't over powering or strong, it smells natural. a little goes a long way so it lasts a long time. Truly an amazing product."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,Refreshing and amazing,This cleanser is awesome. The best after a long day and really cleans your pores. 
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Singapore,ver good,"it smells very nice. removes light to medium coverage makeup without any makeup remover. very good for on the go. very good for fast removal. it stings the eye abit but does not leave face extremely dry
"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,amazing,"I absolutely love this it’s smells so good and doesn’t leave that tight feeling on my face after I use it. I wouldn’t use any other cleanser for my skin
"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,I got a sample and now I'm buying that too,this feels so good on the skin it's not tight like it's been over stripped and dry but I can't see any little makeup residue left over either. I use makeup wipes before to take bulk off
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Malaysia,Hmmm the design was like .. ,"A non special cleanser with some “cherry” scent like drink antibiotic … The design of the cleanser cap is quite weird and non hygiene too. After every squeeze and turn back the cap will leak some extra cleanser out, is very wasting and quite speechless design ….. 
Not gonna repurchase due to the design, but for who wanna get a try can just purchase cause after cleansing I feel my face is smooth and glowing too."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,A little goes a long way,"I love this product because it really cleans my face. Gets rid of all make up, even mascara and I'm not left feeling dry after.  It smells like candy, you may loved it or hate it, and it last so long because you only need less than a dime size to get a really good lather."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,so creamy,This would have to be the creamiest cleanser I’ve ever tried. It feels just beautiful on your skin and at the same time leaves your face so clean. It removes even full night time going out make up with ease and there is no harsh scrubbing necessary. You will seriously love this cleanser.
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,It’s ok. ,"I have not used many Fenty products but from my experience, they are not my favorite. 
The face cleaner is not doing what I need. Not cleansing properly my make up and dries up my skin after using it."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Canada,Great for light-medium makeup removal,"I see a lot of reviews saying it doesn't fully take their makeup off so I will preface this by saying I don't wear a lot of makeup. With my natural makeup routine, this works wonderful. The most impressive thing was that it was not strongly scented and it didn't irritate my eyes. Two things that are a deal breaker as I'm sensitive to strong scents and have sensitive eyes. This left my face feeling fresh and clean, without that tight or dried out feeling. You only need a nickel sized dollop to get the job done. It lathers really nicely!"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Malaysia,best skincare ,"Always love gently skincare products, it’s gentle on skin, removes on impurities, makeup residue and keeps my skin glowing. The best product to purchase "
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Canada,Doesn’t work,Got this for vacation because it’s travel sized but my drugstore face wash works better. The scent is way too strong and it doesn’t even take makeup off
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,It’s a gentle cleanser.,"I rotate this cleanser in my morning and nighttime routines. It always leaves my face feeling clean without any stripping. The cleanser is tropical-scented, comes out as a light and creamy gel, and turns into a frothy lather when activated on damp skin - I can feel and see it working. A little bit goes a long way. The squeeze tube packaging feels like an extra step in my routine."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,cleanser,"cleanser is very good. 
cleaned all the dirts or makeups and gives you a,nice soft skin. 
Skin looks bright and  clean
amazing products. 
nice soft brighter skin 
"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Malaysia,Cleans well,"Honestly, my skin gets quite dry after using it. Not suitable for morning wash especially if you have dry skin. I can get a better cleanser that's cheaper than this. "
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Singapore,amazing scent and leaves the skin soft!,I'm most definitely re-ordering! it's great for removing my foundation and the scent is heavenly -one of those smells that just puts you in a good mood!
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,10/10!  Buy it!,"It's so great!  I have sensitive skin, and this doesn't irritate it at all.  It makes my skin so soft and it smells really good.  I'm super picky and usually pretty critical, but I don't have anything to criticize here.  I also love the bottle.  It's so cute."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,Fenty Skin Total Cleans&#39;R Remove-It-All Cleanser - 145ml,A wonderful moisturizing face wash that doesn’t break break me out
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Singapore,New favourite!,Took some time to get used to the scent since my skincare typically are fragrance free. Gave this a chance and wow it really cleanses well and is not drying at all! Great duo with Fenty Skin Fat Water ;)
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Canada,Good basic cleanser,"This is a really good daily cleanser. I think it is pricey for what it does, but it works really well as a morning cleanser, and also as a part of a double cleanse routine. I like that it lathers up nicely and my face feels really clean after. It does have a fragrance, but that doesn't bug me, it's actually quite nice to wake up to."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,Takes everything off ,"Maybe not the best for sensitive skin as it does have fragrance, but takes off all of my makeup! "
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,New Zealand,big fan,"Love the scent and feel of this product, and my skin is always super clear when I use it! But sometimes it doesn’t get all my mascara off which means I have to use more product than I would if I were using a different cleanser. Great for no make up days, I guess!"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,LOVE,Absolutely love this cleanser! It feels so luxurious on the skin and smells very nice too! Leaves my skin feeling clean and soft! Would definitely buy again!
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,Doesn’t do the job,"Lathers nicely but even when you try scrubbing by your eyes and nose it doesn’t take everything off. I find that I have to go in with a micellar water after to really get my face clean. At first I thought I needed to scrub longer, so I tried doing that the next time but it didn’t work. Not worth it."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,It works,It works wonders. Will definitely recommend buying
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Philippines,alright,"A bit annoyed with the packaging for this, cause it can be a bit messy and the fact that the part where the product comes out of touches the bottom feels a bit unsanitary. 

The product itself is alright at removing makeup - it still leaves some mascara behind, but it’s still better than other products I’ve tried"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Singapore,Love the scent,"I’m going to finish my second bottle, will repurchase. One of my fave cleanser as it doesn’t make my skin so dry after use. I feel fresh after every wash. I also love the scent. "
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Singapore,Facial Wash,A very good product to clean all the make up stain that you have been using one whole day. Smell good and a very worth product to get it. Should try all Fenti brand.
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,Best cleanser,Smoothest cleanser I’ve ever used.Goes on evenly. No scent.
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,Fenty Skin Total Cleans&#39;R Remove-It-All Cleanser - 145ml,It’s nice for a few days use but definitely drys out your skin. I’m happy to have at least tried it!!
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,nice but doesn't remove makeup,"Smells great, feels nice and is gentle on my skin but does little in removing makeup. I find I always need to double cleanse and even then there's still product on my face. Glad to have tried but wouldn't repurchase for a makeup remover"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,Favorite face wash!,"I'm not one to stay with one product, I always like to try new things. With this face wash it's different! I have super sensitive skin and this doesn't burn or leave it tight. I'm about to buy my third cleanser. Also, I think the whole line is great for sensitive skin as well. I use the fat water and sunscreen."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,Gentle cleanser while removing make-up.,"I love the formula of this product. While my skin tends to get oily by the end of the day, I wanted a cleanser that removes all my make-up but not strip my skin dry. This product just does that! Great as an everyday cleanser, I would recommend for normal to oily skin. Also works well with all the other fenty beauty face products. "
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,meh,this product was nice but has a strong fragrance. it doesn’t get all my non waterproof mascara off so i’m scared to even try it to remove my waterproof one
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,BEST CLEANSER! ,"Love this cleanser, it removes makeup and is so gentle on the skin, my face feels so clean after using this but it also doesn’t dry out my skin. Only problem is that sometimes the lid does leak abit of product when it isn’t screwed completely and wiped off. A little bit goes a long way! Still using it after almost a year, ill definitely repurchase"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,New Zealand,In love ,ok this cleanser is good I do however recommend using it once a day if you dont wear makeup or anything. I get dry skin so fast that I only use it twice if I wear makeup all day so before I apply makeup and after I take off my makeup but on regular days when I don't wear makeup I find it too much if I do it once a day. For me it's worked best for my skin type
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,one of my faves,Really enjoying this make up remover. Gets everything off and leaves my face feeling soft. This bottle has lasted me a pretty long time because you don’t need a ton. When you close the cap a small amount come out. If you were to set in on the counter it would get some on there. I just wipe/use that little bit once I tighten cap.
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Canada,Fenty Skin Total Cleans&#39;R Remove-It-All Cleanser - 145ml,I love it!! You just need a tiny squeeze for a nice lather. I find that it removes my make up pretty well (although I always use makeup remover to be extra safe). Leaves my skin feeling soft and glowy. Smells really nice too!
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,cleanser,"This product is so good… it smells incredible… it feels amazing… and works really well on my skin type, which is oily. I first bought the mini set and was amazed by how quickly results came though. Love"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,New Zealand,Love it! Favourite cleanser,"Absolutely love this cleanser - started with a mini and have since purchased a full sized cleanser as it's become my daily go-to. I have combination skin and this doesn't strip my skin or leave it feeling tight or dry, if anything it feels smooth and refreshed and I will generally use this product both morning and night. I have sensitive skin and this does not flare up or irritate my eczema. I find it's still very gentle even with frequent use, but unlike some other products I feel like my face is nice and clean after every use. Will continue buying this one - would recommend! Good value for money - the tube is nice and big and lasts a long time. "
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,Fenty Skin Total Cleans&#39;R Remove-It-All Cleanser - 145ml,Love this cleanser. It completely removes all make up and leaves your skin feeling Soo clean. The only thing I don’t like is how the cleanser is dispensed. It oftens leaves residue on the seal after twist the tube closed.
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Canada,removes all sunblock/makeup,"This is amazing, go Rihanna!  I have tried many cleansers before and this one a) takes all makeup and sunblock off in one go, b) doesn't dry skin, c) doesn't cause breakouts.  I am super sensitive and acne prone and this is by far the best cleanser I have come across in 50 years!!!!"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,perfect for removing makeup after a long night out,a little goes a long way here and I love it. It lasted me a while and I will be buying more. I wish the cap was better it doesn't feel very hygienic and can be hard to get out. will get all ur make up off in one go I promise 
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Canada,PLEASE CHANGE THE PACKAGING,"Love this cleanser. Smell, lather, the glow it gives, all 5 star. But daaaang this tube is the worst ever. I’ve purchased a few times cause the product inside is the bomb but if I have to use full strength and Teo hands to get it out I’m overrrrr it boo. Sorry riri. Love you and fenty skin but I’ve had enough! It would be 5 stars if it was the same as the spf moisturizer packaging!"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Malaysia,Love this cleanser!!,I bought the trial skin kit to try first before purchasing the regular size. This cleanser keeps my skin clean and refreshed it feels very good after using this product. 
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,New Zealand,the best ,"one of the best cleanser i’ve ever used. it really does the job and doesn’t leave the skin feeling tight, dry or irritated afterwards. will definitely purchase it again in the future! 
"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Malaysia,a good all around ,If you like non-stripping cleansers then this is a really good one to pick up if you feel you want that touch of lux. Fenty does products well and I even like how it feels after. 
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,Almost 5 star,"I really like this cleanser it leaves skin feeling clean but not dried out. Similar to rest of range have found this is good with combination skin.
The only thing I dislike is that I have found is that sometimes the lid doesn’t close properly and some extra product leaks. The bit that leaks out can smell unpleasant when you next go to use it. Otherwise great cleanser. 
"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Philippines,Totally Cleans’d!,"Love the texture of this cleanser. A little goes a looong way! It was creamy and gave a good cleanse without drying skin. The scent is quite pleasant, but I wish Fenty would create a fragrance free version."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Philippines,go-to,This is my go-to cleanser. It doesn’t have a strong scent and it doesn’t dry out my skin. I love it so much I think I went through a handful of bottles already. 
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Malaysia,like ,I do try a new Fenty Beauty which is Fenty Skin products’s range.The smells good. I used it at day and night and feel good. It doesn’t make my skin any big changes which is good. I always bought in travel size because easy to carry. This second time i bought it. It just only i dont like this kind of tube so much. Thats all. Thank you.
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,Fenty Skin Total Cleans&#39;R Remove-It-All Cleanser - 145ml,"Amazing, all 3 products. After getting chemical burns from the Clinique acne system, I used this. My face is clearer, my skin tone is evener. I love it here and I highly recommend. And I never miss my face routine."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Singapore,Amazing cleanser ,"Definitely an amazing cleanser, fenty products are the bomb and this is definitely did not disappoint. worked pretty well, keep the skin clean and removed all thr impurities from make up. recommended Definitely."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Singapore,obsessed,i bought the smaller size at first to try it out and see if my skin has any reaction to it or anything and surprisingly it works so well with my skin. the niacinamide helps with my breakouts and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,Okay,"I had a mini of this as part of a set. I didn't end up using it up because I found that I liked other cleansers better. This wasn't a bad cleanser and I didn't have any bad reactions to it. I personally think the texture was too thick, and like others have said, it made it hard to squeeze out of the tube. Otherwise, I probably would've used it up (I didn't love the product enough to hassle with it). However, I will say the concept of the tube is nice....it just needs a different formula that isn't so thick."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,"Great product, not so great container","Awesome cleanser. Removes all makeup. It doesn’t dry out your skin, or leave it oily. The only problem is the packaging. The cleanser doesn’t come out easily, and the tube tends to break on the top seal, wasting the cleanser. It would be 5 star if that problem is fixed."
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,USA,no go,"Nope, broke me out immediately, had high hopes but just no, sorry riri and the opening of the bottle sucks"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,New Zealand,does the job!,"Love the texture honestly and always feel really clean afterwards. Not too drying. Just not a huge fan of the scent nor the vessel itself. I feel the part where the cleanser comes out of is not necessarily the most hygienic dispenser, but all up, it’s good value for money. "
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Australia,Best Cleanser to remove makeup,"To start the product is super easy to use and the twist cap makes it easier so you don’t lose the lid. The product feels so good on the skin and removes the makeup instantly. I have never used a cleaner that has worked faster than this. It dosent’ burn my eyes if the product goes near it so I think it’s also good for removing makeup under the eyes. It leaves your skin clean and free from pollution, I love it!"
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Singapore,All in one cleanser ,"This cleanser is amazing!

FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Canada,Fenty Skin Total Cleans&#39;R Remove-It-All Cleanser - 145ml,Smells lovely/ but kind of drying and the packaging is weird. Hard to squeeze out. I bought the day cream and night cream too and after 3 days I had 5 new pimples. Not good for combo or dry skin at all
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Malaysia,Okay,This cleanser removes makeup completely but for eye makeup. I need to use other cleanser to remove my eye makeup. Love the smell and the texture.
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Canada,Fenty Skin Total Cleans&#39;R Remove-It-All Cleanser - 145ml,Love the product but it seal was broken and I could not use it properly. Lot code 1M01F
FENTY SKIN-Total Cleans'R Remove-It-All Cleanser,Singapore,so effective ,"for those lazy (drunken) days, this is an effective, one wash removes all. doesn’t dry the skin as much and i have dry skin. smells great, like vanilla and is super silky. i think my only complaint is that, the opening of the product is from the bottom (twist and turn) and i find it a bit unhygienic. "
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Philippines,glad i tried it,"Definitely a wow for me! it removes sunscreen products on my face, even my peeling dry skin since i was doing an exfoliation on my face but this is so gentle on cleansing and feels nourishing"

SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Great oil cleanser,"I loved using this oil cleanser as first part of my double cleanse routine. First of all, it smells great and second, it really broke down my makeup and left my skin feeling soft. I probably didn’t need to follow with a second cleanser but old habits lol it is a bit expensive so not sure if I’d repurchase as there are other oil cleansers on the market that do the same thing but I definitely felt luxurious using it."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Shu Uemura Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"Honestly the sample package was super small, which only allowed for 2 days worth of cleanser. In those 2 days it seemed to react fine with my skin, however 2 days isn't long enough to get a really good opinion on it."

SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Removes sunscreen and makeup but can be irritating,"This cleansing oil does a good job of removing stubborn sunscreen and full-coverage makeup. However, there seems to be an ingredient in here that causes slight irritation. Could it be one of the botanical oils? Also, the oil does not rinse away completely clean. You basically have to double-rinse afterwards if you're looking for that fresh feeling."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Amazing product!,I was given the opportunity to #trybeforeyoubuy from #butterly and I'm greatful I did! The product made my face feel clean and soft without feeling to oily and smelled amazing.  Definitely worth trying!

It has such a lovely scent, and it left my face feeling as soft as a flower petal. 

Thank you Butterly for giving me the chance to try this fantastic product. I highly recommend!"

SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Cleansing oil for the win,I couldn't wait to incorporate this Shu Uemura Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil in my skincare routine. I used this product for 2 weeks and am so impressed with how my skin looks and feels. I really like that you don't have to use too much of the oil to get a very good lather and clean. I have been using this as part of my nighttime skincare routine and will definitely be purchasing. The scent of the product is light and not overpowering. #gotitfree
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Shu uemura,If it came in something more than a sachet I would be able to tell you how well it worked. How much makeup I ware is different on the daily depending 9n where I am going. But out of the two days that I used this it took off any remaining make up and left my skin feeling soft and smooth. Even hours afterwards I notice that my skin felt the same as it did five minutes of using this product. #Butterflyfreesample #tryShuUemura

SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Feels Disgusting and greasy. Don't recommend,"The sample made my skin feel so disgusting and I had to use my exfoliation gloves and face wash to make my skin soft again. 
This was really oily/greasy and did the opposite of what you'd expect from a cleansing product. 
I threw it out and will not be purchasing it. Thankful to try before I buy with butterly and chickadvisor. This is not for me."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Great product,I was given this product to try love how it made my face feel all nice and clean. Would Buy it but don't have a store around that sells.it. would I tell my friends about it heck ya.
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Sublime is Right!,"I liked this cleansing oil very much. It left my skin feeling moisturized and quite soft and smooth. After several days' use, I did notice slightly less visible pores as well. I generally don't like using oils due to my combination skin type but this one didn't feel greasy or sticky. I would probably buy it again if I found it at a reasonable price."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Super smooth and hydrating,"While I’d heard a lot of raving about oil cleansing, I had yet to try it myself. I was a little apprehensive at first as I really wasn’t sure how it would remove my makeup and clean my face. But it did wonders. My makeup broke down very easily and was removed completely upon rinsing. This also left my face super smooth and hydrated too. And the best part? It didn’t sting my eyes like id feared it would. Id love to purchase it again to get an effective yet gentle and hydrating clean"
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Felt great!!,I loved the way this made my skin feel.  I would purchase it but I'm on a budget and cannot afford to spend money on specialty items.  But I would buy it if I could.
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Soft finish and easy on the skin,"Love this product, it made my skin feel soft and supple. My skin is usually textured and starting to show wrinkles, this helped to give moisture, silk touch and makeup removal in one. I would love to buy again but unfortunately the price seems a bit out of my range, maybe I can catch in on a sale day! Thank you!"
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,I love this product,Thank you for the opportunity to try this product for free. It goes on nicely and takes my makeup off easily.

SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Lovely but a but pricey.,I was provided a small sample from butterfly to test. It wasn't quite enough to try more than once but I did enjoy the texture.  It did a great job of removing my makeup.  I followed up with my regular cleanser after.
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,A must-have product!,"This cleansing oil is super lightweight and leaves the skin silky, smooth and nourished. Removes makeup well and has a very pleasant scent too! Will repurchase."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Leaves your skin silky and smooth,"Received a small sample size to try, and thought it was great! It cleaned my face fairly well and left my skin smooth and silky. Did find it difficult to remove mascara, and while I like the way it made my skin feel, I still prefer a more squeaky clean feeling after I clean my face for the night. Probably wouldn’t buy this in full size, as the price is high, but if you have money to splurge, this might be a great option for you!"
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Oil cleanser is definitely a Win in my book,I tried this product as I got a sample of it from Butterly - I absolutely loved it!  not only did it leave my skin feeling completely clean but also incredibly moisturized.

SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Didn't pair well with my acne prone skin,"I love using Cleansing oils when I have time to do a two cleanser morning session. Using a Cleansing Oil makes my face feels moisturized. But I do feel like it's not fully cleaned because of the oily residue left after.

I have acne prone skin and unfortunately this line from Shu Uemura didn't pair well with my skin. The Skin Purifer is definitely better for me. 

The Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil gently cleanses makeup pretty well, even waterproof ones!

I won't ve purchasing this product again, but I think it'll be great for non-acne prone skin."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Left my skin feeling nice!,"After reading how to use this product as this was the first time I had ever used an oil as a cleansing product I was intrigued. 
It was very smooth and cleaned my skin well after a long days work while still leaving it feeling smooth. I would definitely use it again!"
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Great,"great but abit drying on skin maybe to mix with water as the sales person mentioned. overall removes make up and maybe moisturize skin abit, wash off with facial wash after use if u don't like oil feeling"
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Love! Great for sensitive eyes,This cleansing oil removes all traces of makeup and leaves skin feeling silky smooth. I especially love using it on my eyes because I have sensitive/ dehydrated eye area and this really helps gently remove all traces of eye makeup without irritation or tugging. I use before my cleanser and have been really enjoying the way it removes my makeup so effortlessly.
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Shu Uemura Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,I like the feel of this cleansing oil. I felt it did a wonderful job cleansing my face and left my skin moisturized without dryness. I would recommend this product to anyone with dry skin

This is a really great facial oil. Leaves your skin feeling smooth and silky. Not heavy on the skin
An excellent product if you have sensitive skin like me. 
Would definitely buy."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Singapore,My holy grail,I've been running through many bottles of Shu Uemura cleansing oil so so many years. Nothing beats Shu Uemura cleansing oil in terms of removing waterproof makeup so effectively.
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Great facial oil,"I have used numerous different facial oils that have always left me feeling like I have oily or greasy skin, this product was pleasantly surprising. It left my skin feeling soft and moisturizer without leaving an oily residue. My skin felt extremely soft and healthy. So glad I was able to test this products."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Something I’d never tried before,I had to look up how to use this product on the internet because there was not instruction or information in English. Once I figured it out I was pleasantly surprised! I product it self was nice and smooth. Easy to use. I have very sensitive skin and I didn’t break out from it at all. I wish there was a little more as I would have liked to use it for a 2 week span to see noticeable differences. I did notice smoother skin and not as many bumps on my face. It didn’t feel oily or greasy at all. I would recommend it.
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Shu Uemura Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"I was really surprised by this product. I had my doubts when I received my sample but decided to give it an honest try. It effortlessly removed my makeup. I was left feeling super moisturized, smooth and with less visible pores.  Seeing the words cleansing oil had me very nervous of having clogged pores and breakouts but I was pleasantly surprised when that didnt happen. I would definitely use this product again🙂"

SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Great quality,This is a great quality product but not for my skin. I felt like it made my skin type break out but maybe my sample wasn’t big enough to fully test it out. I would recommend to others though.
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Shu Uemura Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"Always liked Shu Uemura, had used their eyebrow pencils, eyelash curler and also lip gloss. Quality products and when i saw a chance to try something from their line, I was excited. Cleansing oil seemed to be very effective, and the smell was nice, (some other brands have off putting smells)
Gently rubbing it onto skin, a little bit was enough for my whole face, no need to use copious amount of product. my face felt clean and clear afterward but i think long term use would be better to gauge the effectiveness. I do have roseacea from time to time-so i was a bit cautious as I do not know what triggers it sometimes. so far it seems good."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Shu Uemura Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"I received a sample for my honest review. 
It’s a good product to remove your make up, and makes your face fresh and clean. However the price is too steep for me."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Ultime8 Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,"I received a sample for my honest review. 
I found the product to be great, it cleansed off my makeup and made my face feel fresh, and rejuvenated. I didn't find it dried out my skin but left it feel supple. I loved it."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Not the best out there,"I expected more from this product did not live up to the hype, may be needed to use it for sometime but the sample was really small so really did not see any difference. Now I am skeptical to buy a full size bottle."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Great product,"I used to clean off my makeup, gentle and effective, moisturized my skin great. I like this product, received a free sample, but the sample was only for one use, so unsure how well it would work over an extended period."

SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Shu Uemura Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil - 150ml,The cleansing oil works really well on its own on removing oils and make up.

SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Exceeding my expectations,"wasn’t really a fan of the oily feel to it at first, but after a few times I was amazed with the way my skin felt!  I added a little water on my face after I applied the oil, It absorbs really fast and it stays on the skin to provide a more effective base for my moisturizer.  The scent is subtle, which is okay. I have to say that this is a nice addition to your skin regimen.  
Your skin will thank you."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Love this oil!,"This product works great, doesnr make me breakout at all and makes my skin feel amazing"
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,indifferent,"from the size of the sample, it was difficult to determine any long term benefits.  The product did leave the skin feeling very smooth and velvety.  I could not justify the price."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Great product but not right for me.,"This product works well, it takes off waterproof make-up with ease. The smell is pleasing and a little goes a long way. Just for me the formula was a little heavy and left my skin looking grease. If you have dry skin this product would be perfect for you."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Cleanses without stripping skin,"I’ve never used a cleansing oil before this and was skeptical about using oil to properly clean my face. I had to search online for instructions on how to use properly as there weren’t any included with my sample, not sure if instructions are on the full size bottle but I am the type to read instructions and ingredients. I liked this product as it removed my makeup but didn’t dry out my skin, it felt soft and seemed to glow afterwards. I feel this would be a nice addition to a skincare routine but I don’t know about using it on daily basis, maybe 2x/week and my regular cleanser the remainder of the time."

SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Good overall product,"I received a sample of this product for free few days ago and I have to say that I am not completely satisfied by the product for the price it is selling. It’s not cleansing my face the way I like it to be. 
#gotitfree #butterly"
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Such a great cleanser!,"I'm such a fan of this cleanser! It's gentle to the eyes, lightly scented, and removes makeup very quickly and easily. My skin does not feel stripped and feels very soft after cleansing. I use this as the first step in my double-cleansing routine. Will definitely repurchase this again!"
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,"Gentle, Effective Cleansing Oil","I received a free sample from Butterly for an honest review. 
I'm very satisfied with the trial size of this cleansing oil. Long-term, I can't say how well my skin would fare. Overall, the oil was gentle on my skin and successfully removed my makeup without drying my face. I'd love to try more of it, but unless there's a sale, it's unfortunately out of my budget."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Not for me,"I have received a free sample to try.
i have used it once and i found the product did not remove properly my makeup. (it removed my foundation but not my eyeliner). The product smells good (strong but good). But from the price tag of a bottle i would of expected better results at removing my makeup."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,"Effective, even for oily skin","Thank you @butterly and @ShuUemura for
the opportunity to test and review a sample sachet of Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil.

I found this cleansing oil to be very moisturizing and to effectively remove my makeup.  Although there was a small amount in the sachet, it was enough to notice that I liked it and I would use it again.  Even though I have oily skin, I still benefited from using this cleansing oil, as it made my face smooth and soft.

SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Great Product,So I tried this product. It works great for removing makeup as I wear makeup everyday. It zlso moisturizes the skin and it felt clean. I would buy this if it was on sale as it's above my budget. Great product
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,i love this oil,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Shu Uemura's oil has always been a great product to have especially getting those full coverage foundation and magnetic eyeliner off your face. I am just not sure if I am using it right. Directions on the packaging would be great to have. #gotitfree #tryShuUemura
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,"Gentle cleansing oil, on the pricey side","It is a good cleansing oil, It is not very thick. It is lightweight and gets the job done. I tried a sample and the smell is good, while not being heavily perfumed."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,It Changed My Mind on Cleansing Oils!,"This was my first time using a cleansing oil for many years. I have never been fond of using oils for double cleansing but this one definitely changed my mind. I knew I had to try this product as I love the Shu Uemura Brand. My eyelash curler is almost 10 years old, and works just as well as the day I bought it! This cleansing oil was no exception. It's smells like a spa, and feels luxurious on the skin. It softened my skin, and helped my dry patches. My skin looked less red, very hydrated and plump. I would definitely recommend this product as part of a double cleanse routine!"
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Shu Uemura Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"I like cleaning oils but I find it hard to find a good formula that removes makeup well without leaving a very greasy feeling on the skin. This one is just like that, luxurious texture, great feeling. I had to use it twice to remove my make up completely, but it didn’t feel like a film on my skin afterwards. I received a sample to try the product and review."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Shu Uemura Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"I received a sample of this cleansing oil through Butterly, and I am very pleased with the product! It felt gentle on my skin, but did not leave it too greasy, which I was afraid of.  It has a night scent, and I found you only need to use a small amount of product."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Shu Uemura Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil - 150ml,I received this as a free sample and I liked the way it smelled and worked but to add this to my daily routine isn't really what I would do as I didn't see much change in my skin. However a very tiny bit goes a long way which is good.
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Made my skin feel soft,I received a free sample from Butterly.  There was enough in the sample for a few cleanses.  It smelled lovely and worked very well.  Didn't leave me with an overly oily feeling either.  I would definitely recommend it.
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,great cleansing oil if you have the cash to splurg,"i received a free sample of this cleansing oil from #butterly. i loved the consistency and smell of this oil. it removed all my makeup and sunscreen really well, left my skin super soft and felt very luxurious! if I had the extra cash to splurge on this I would definitely purchase it. #tryShuUemura"
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,"Good cleansing oil, but could be stronger","I tried the sample of the Shu Uemura cleansing oil. The sample was very generous and the oil didn’t cause me any breakouts. It had a nice light fragrance to it and didn’t feel heavy on the skin. It rinsed off easily, as well; however, after going over my face with toner, it still picked up makeup residue. Overall, the oil cleanser was a good product, though it could be a little more effective in taking off makeup."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Switching to this oil cleansing!,"I received this amazing #freeproduct from #thisisbutterly in exchange of my honest review. It's a small amount of sample but I was able to use it twice in the evening. I was so amazed how it removed the suncreen I wore thoughout the day. Ofcourse, I still have to do double cleasing but it does the job it suppose to do. I would definitely buy a full size of this ans would reccomend to my family and friends."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,"Gentle on the skin,  removed makeup well","It is very gentle on the skin,  I have combination skin, so if a cleanser is too dry it will show immediately on my dry spots, this is a great oil to cleanse skin and remove makeup. I have purchased the full size!"
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Shu Uemura Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"Lovely cleansing oil. I enjoy the fragrance it wasn't to strong. Seems to work very well, will definitely look for this product and more of the line in my local stores"
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,A must have for your day to day routine!,I really liked this cleanser from Clarins! Felt really nice on my skin and my face was not shiny the next day which was nice! I feel like you do not need a lot either which is a bonus! I definitely want to buy this cleanser! I would recommend it to friends and family.
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Shu Uemura Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"Luxurious cleansing with the sublime oil. Great way to treat my skin after a long day of wearing makeup. The cleaning oil removes any residue without drying my skin, keeping it soft and hydrated."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,"Seems like a good cleanser, but a bit pricey","I received a free sample of this product courtesy of Butterly/ChickAdvisor to try and review.
I used this cleanser to remove my makeup after a night out and it did a decent job of cleaning all of it off except the waterproof eye makeup (mascara & eyeliner). I had to use the whole package to get a good clean though, which I am unsure I should have needed to. If you don't use waterproof eye makeup then this product would be a good product to invest in. The retail cost of this item is a little out of my range though as I don't believe it would last me much longer than a less expensive face wash would."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Gentle on the skin,"I received a tester for reviewing purposes so it wasn’t enough to make a lasting difference but from the sample itself the product was gentle on the skin, felt nice and smelt great. Overall I would try this product again"
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Luscious beauty oil cleanser,The sublime beauty cleansing oil left my skin feeling soft and lush. My usual cleansers can’t compare as they always leave my skin feeling dry and stripped of any moisture.
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,"Love, love, love!","I loved this product! It did what it claimed and smells terrific! It easily removed my make-up, even the waterproof mascara, and left no greasy feel."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Shu Uemura Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"I was given a sample to try for free. #Butterly #gotitfree 
I liked the smell and feel of the product. It did remove my makeup, just too expensive for me personally."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Love how soft my skin feels,I received this as a Free sample of SHU UEMURA  from Butterly ( ChickAdvisor)  I was surprised how many uses I was able to get from such a small Sample.  It has made my skin feel so soft even just after the first use.  I will definitely consider treating myself to a full bottle.
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Works like a charm!,"I was a little bit skeptical as to how can this really clean make up off my face until I tried it. It was surprisingly effective and good. I still find that I needed to wash further with my cleanser but overall, it works as it is. Will definitely put this in my rotation especially when travelling."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,One swipe removal to reveal beauty,Full face of makeup removed in one wipe using Ultime8 luxurious cleansing oil from Shu uemura!! My skin had a incredible softness. Skin rejuvenation to my younger years. With a very pretty floral scent that was just beautiful.
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Cleans well without drying,"I have heard good things about this product for a while but bever got the chance to try it. It really lives up to its name, it cleans makeup very well but it doesn't leave my skin dry like other cleansing oils. It emulsifies well and is easy to rinse off. No wonder it is a holy grail product for a lot of people"
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Great product,"I received this as a free sample from butterly. I used this as my second step when double cleansing. It’s an oil so needless to say it’s not just oily it has a very watery consistency. I’ve used oil cleansers before and they were all somewhat thicker. However, I didn’t mind that at all I just had to work a bit faster to get it on my face before it ran off. The smell was such a clean scent and It left my skin so soft and hydrated. Any remaining makeup from my first cleanse was definitely removed with this as my second. I also tried this as my first cleanse to see how well it would remove makeup and I wasn’t disappointed. It melted the makeup right off including my waterproof mascara. I will definitely purchase the full size and recommend this to everyone."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Works as well as affordable cleansing oils,"Really glad I had the opportunity to try out the OG cleansing oil from Shu Uemura.  However I only got a little sample packet to try the good thing I never do full face makeup anyways so this is enough to remove my waterproof mascara.

This oil has a very light non-greasy consistency and a very lovely floral scent. You apply it dry to the areas you want to remove makeup from, in my case it's my lashes. Massage it in and then add a little bit of water, and emulsify the water on your face. Once I feel that there are no more mascara bits, that's when I can rinse off with water. I like to double cleanse my face with a normal facial cleanser afterwards because I don't like the idea of any oil left on my face. This oil doesn't leave an overly greasy oily feeling but there is still some ""slip"". 

I would say this worked well on my waterproof mascara, but can't say that it works any better than my usual, more affordable cleansing oil. And for this reason I will not be repurchasing. #tryshuuemura"
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Excellent cleansing oil,"Tried it day and night for a couple of days. The cleansing that I achieved was much better than the micellular water that I normally purchase. It felt more effective. Also, the skin did not look dry. The tone of my skin looked more even and healthy."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,"Great texture, great smell, great effect","I got to #tryShuUemura from #Butterly #gotitfree.  I had never tried cleansing oil before.  Since I had dry skin, I actually liked it quite a bit as it felt like it moisturized my skin more than stripping it.  It doesn’t leave your skin feeling oily after you cleanse though and does a great job at removing makeup.  The texture was nice having gone from an oil to a milky texture as you cleanse.  I love the scent too!"
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Great cleanser,This cleanser left my skin feeling clean and smooth.  The oil turns to a milky consistency easily. The sample size received was perfect amount to get the job done.  #tryitfreewithbutterly #tryShuUemura
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,"C'est cher, mais il a une grande capacité et dure","Parmi les nettoyants à l'huile que j'ai utilisés jusqu'à présent, c'est le
plus confortable à utiliser, à la fois pour démaquiller et hydrater la peau après utilisation. 
Je suis encore plus reconnaissante que cela serve également de soin du vieillissement."
SHU UEMURA-Ultime8∞ Sublime Beauty Cleansing Oil,Canada,Great,"This cleansing oil is one of the best I have used to remove makeup. To start off, the scent is very pleasant. The oil is light and can spread easily across your face. It washes clean off your face and doesnt leave your face feeling oily. This is a must buy product for anyone that uses makeup especially on a daily basis."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Philippines,a must in my travel skincare bag,"nice cleanser! just apply to dry skin and wipe it off, which is perfect for travelling and when you need to clean your face quickly without a bathroom nearby! nice soft feeling after using it, but I didn't test it at night to try and wash sunblock off, I don't think this cleanser can get the job done in that way. I won't be adding this to my routine, but I will purchase it again for travel purposes."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,"Ok, but there are better alternatives IMO","It’s ok, but it’s not like Estée Lauder’s nighttime cleansing balm. I’ll stick with Estée Lauder. It just didn’t seem to rinse clean."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Do not recommend,"Probably the worst of the worst product I have ever used. I would give it a -100 if I could. Does not wipe off makeup at all, you need to do it at least 3 times (I wear very minimal makeup). I am so disappointed at this product."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Convenience + Utility,"I have a chronic illness that occasionally causes mobility issues. This cleanser has been a godsend on those days, in that I can just leave it in my bedside table and I won’t have to get up and go to the sink - I can do it all from my bed, and just wipe off with a dry washcloth. I will forever keep one of these in my nightstand. I just wanted to add this for anyone else who might have mobility issues! I also have dry skin, but this doesn’t leave my skin feeling stripped at all."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Please read the directions before reviewing!,"The vast majority of the negative reviews are due to user error- people seem to have ignored the directions completely and decided that 1) this is a second cleanser 2) you use it like a foaming cleanser. It needs to be put on DRY skin and it DOES NOT RINSE OFF. You wipe it off like you would an old-fashioned cold cream. If you actually use it the way they clearly tell you to, it indeed does remove ALL makeup.

Also, a couple of reviews say that it “smells bad”. It doesn’t. People will complain about fragrance in a product and those same people will complain that it doesn’t smell good when fragrance isn’t used. You can’t have it both ways. Anyway, I recommend this as long as you can follow the directions!"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Malaysia,not a fav cleanser,just wanted to try. since i used the dr dennis ahabeta clenser. i dont like the feeling of left over icky texture. i guess its suppose to moisturise. so it does its job. but i have dry skin...and my makeup does not easily come off
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,it’s okay,"If this product washed off, I would give it 5 stars, because I love the way it melts off waterproof makeup. But it smears and you have to use a washcloth to remove everything. Even with a second cleanse, this product lingers."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Not a makeup remover,"This doesn't actually take any of my makeup off. I have to use it twice to actually ""melt"" anything away, and rinse twice to remove all of the greasy residue it leaves behind. I would recommend trying literally anything else before this"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,Barely took off my makeup and had me looking like a raccoon! It also didn’t feel that great on my face. It did have a nice smell.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Malaysia,bagus,All product under this brand i can consider very good so if you are first timer dont hesitate to buy. Sexy boxes nice packaging good texture and good result. 
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,love,"Really love this product, I feel like it doesn’t strip my skin. I go back between this and Biologic Recharge. I love the way my skin feels after."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,Compared to Elemis this is a great alternative and even better price. Truly help clean your skin while removing your makeup all in one. Also very hydrating!
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Malaysia,worst cleanser i have tried 🥴,"i bought this one as my trial and test for dr dennis gross brand. its so awful, cant believe it doesnt work as just as  a cleanser. i doesnt feel cleaned and fresh after using, my powder just powder i used still on after cleansing. my face looks grossy after cleansing. oh, really feel disappointed on this dermatologist brand."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"It feels really good & doesn’t dry out your skin, BUT… it does not remove makeup at all!
I’ll use as my first step in double cleansing until it’s gone, but will not repurchase."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"A bit pricey but the best make up remover so far! One cleanse is enough to get makeup off, followed by face cleaning gel."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,not my favorite,"For me, this was nothing particularly special. It might work better for other skin types but I’ve found the CereVe SA cleanser to work far better on my acne prone skin!"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Slimy,"This leaves a really slimy film on my skin, and I used it after I took my makeup off. I had to wash my face twice just to get the film feeling off, and my skin still feels gross. No thanks, returning ASAP"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,YES PLEASE,I know there are a lot of mixed reviews and I’m so glad I didn’t listen because I LOVE this moisturizing cleanser. It leaves my skin so soft and doesn’t make it red. It’s actually the only face wash (other than fresh) that hasn’t irritated my skin. Love love LOVE 10/10
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Canada,Great product!,I love this cleanser! Works great for my skin which is super dry and sensitive. I also love that it hardly has a smell and you don't need to wash it off! Even removed my water proof makeup!
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Great gentle cleanser.,This is great for sensitive skin! I do not have sensitive skin so I really only use this if my skin feels a little stripped or sensitive.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Holy Grail - read the directions ppl!,"This product is incredible and my holy grail!!! But the negative comments are a joke. It is a waterless product! So all of these comments about it doesn’t rinse off, couldn’t wash it off - you wipe it off! Read the bottle. Don’t use with water. Period. At all. When used properly, it really brightens my skin, leaves it so soft and supple and removes all of my makeup. This is probably the best cleanser I’ve ever tried."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,just ok,"If you’re looking for a face wash that you use on dry skim, I would recommend Biossance or Tara Harper. This one will probably work best on young, clean skin.  Not for a 40+ y/o."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Malaysia,besttt ,Used this as second cleanser at night. It can remove make up and also sun screen. Worth the price. Definitely will by this again . Combine this with dr Dennis pore cleanser
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,Terrible product. It doesn’t remove makeup. It leaves a slimy mess. I’m going to stick with Origins Frothy Face wash. It’s a stellar product in comparison.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"Don’t like this at all, sometimes it removes the makeup  but most times it doesn’t . It leaves a very weird sticky oily film on the skin and you have to use a lot if you have a full face of makeup , won’t purchase again"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,It Works!,This is so gentle on my skin and does not strip away anything. It is not oily at all and my skin feels so hydrated after I’m done.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"I lightly wears makeup and sunscreens but it doesn't melt away my sunscreens or makeup. AND rinse is not an optional, It’s a must. It feels so greasy (not moisturized )even after wash with my light cleanser I always use."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,New fav!,"I’m not sure why others are saying it does not remove makeup. If used on dry skin as directed, it literally melts off makeup! Eyeliner, eyeshadow, mascara, foundation, lipstick, and everything else. It can burn your eyes so try to avoid getting too close. I love that you do not need to rinse it off which is great when i’m feeling lazy haha. I use a makeup eraser to wipe off the product and it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and refreshed. I also like that this is in a squeeze bottle instead of a jar that you have to scoop out like other similar products."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,absolute crap,Doesn’t remove makeup. Waste of money. Need to rub off my entire eye for anything to come off. Do not purchase
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"Used it a couple of time and decided it's really not for me. Even using another cleanser after this I can still feel this residue. I'm generally not sensitivity to products, but this breaks me out every time."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Canada,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"Got a small sample version of this and I'm glad I did, instead of spending my money. This smells bad and only removes maybe 30% of makeup. It also leaves this oily texture after you wash it off."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Canada,Unique,"The only balmy cleanser with no oil and great skincare ingredients. Love it for my sensitive combo to dry skin. Doesn't strip, you feel hydrated and protected after cleansing. Rebuying this when it empties. An oil-less cleanser was needed because I do microcurrents several times a week after cleansing in evenings."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Canada,Not great for removing eye makeup,"I was looking for an alternative cleanser, since I usually use coconut oil or Lush’s Babyface solid cleanser (since discontinued) as my go to makeup remover. I don’t wear waterproof eyeliner or mascara, so I was hopeful this would be a great alternative to coconut oil. The product is beautiful, smells great, and makes my skin feel lovely. However I bought it specifically for removing eye makeup and it just doesn’t cut the muster. Not awful but not effective enough for me to purchase again."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Removes Nothing,So disappointing. This does not remove makeup.  It smears it around (mascara just smeared down your cheeks) and then leaves behind an oily film after you use a washcloth to remove it.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Canada,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"Not gonna lie, I’m slightly obsessed with this one. I love the fact that it just melts your makeup off, my daughter also loves it"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"Love it, takes off makeup. It makes my skin feel silky smooth."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,didn’t love it.,"I have dry skin and this did nothing great. I didn’t use it to take off my eye makeup as I use eye makeup remover for that but it did take off everything else.

It really didn’t leave my face moisturized afterwards. I saw no need to keep this for this price point. I returned it today."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,great first step of skincare!,"Great to remove make up before cleansing. Micellar just doesn’t remove waterproof mascara, which is where this guy comes in. I use it to remove anything waterproof, then use micellar to wipe it off. Then use face wash. Not exactly an abstract concept."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Left an oily/greasy film on my skin,"Left an oily/greasy film on my skin after washing.  If you want clean skin, then do not use this product unless you follow it up with a proper cleanser.  This product is would only be affective if you desired a double-cleanse."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Gentle on eyes,"As the directions say, I used it on dry skin.  I loved how it was gentle and safe to use on eyes and didn't sting or irritate my eyes."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Canada,"Not a makeup remover, but is non-stripping","It claims that it dissolves makeup and dirt - it doesn't. I do like that it doesn't make my skin feel completely stripped but you need A LOT of product and multiple cleanses of just this cleanser alone to get all makeup off. If you are using it as a makeup remover, be prepared to use a ton of product, only for residual makeup to be all over your towels. Quite disappointed as it's not cheap and you need a lot of product just to get off a minimal amount of face makeup."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,Love to use as step 1 in my double cleanse. When your skin needs an extra drink use this product!
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Not effective on eye makeup,"I was disappointed that this product did not ‘melt away’ my makeup, especially my more stubborn water resistant eye makeup. Also, the cleanser seemed to irritate my sensitive eyes. This one is a pass."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Great cleanser for dry sensitive skin,"I have super dry, sensitive, eczema prone skin. I recently damaged my moisture barrier in recent months and couldn’t really use any cleanser on my skin. This is as gentle as water is, comparable to the cerave cleanser if not more gentle."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,DO NOT BUY!,this product left such oily finish on my skin!! i hated it so much!! did not take away my mascara at all neither!! waste of your money.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Follow with the peel pads!,"I love this product. It’s the first cleansing balm type of product I’ve used that I’m not paranoid if I accidentally leave some on my face. The directions recommend following it up with the alpha beta peel pads... this tip has totally changed my skin! I can lay in bed and rub this all over my face, wipe it off with a make up eraser or the sort, and then follow with the pads and moisturizer and I feel just as accomplished as I do when I drag my lazy butt to the sink!"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Mediocre Makeup Remover,"Wow. Maybe I'm not using this correctly, or maybe I don't understand this product, but I'm not really sure now what it's supposed to accomplish. You apply it to dry skin, massaging until makeup is dissolved, then rinse. It's more of a makeup remover than a cleanser, but it doesn't really dissolve or remove makeup and it leaves a greasy film behind. I definitely don't feel cleansed after using this 'cleanser'. It's more a mediocre makeup remover than a cleanser."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Does not remove all makeup,"I have dry, very sensitive skin. I recently started learning how to properly care for my skin type, so I switched from my very loyal neutrogena foaming cleanser to a moisturizing cleanser. My daily makeup includes one layer of medium coverage foundation and waterproof mascara. While this does remove the foundation, this does NOT remove all of the mascara. I have to use micellar water afterwards to remove it completely and that is even after a full 60 seconds of cleansing. This does smell good and leaves my skin soft, but is not ideal for heavier makeup users."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Canada,GROSSLY mislabeled,"This label is “grossly” mislabeled.
It did not remove my makeup, nor did it cleanse my face. Instead, it left an oily film, and my makeup was still on my face (just rubbed all over).
How are so many people in love with this, I have no idea."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"I’m still learning how best to use this, but I really do like it. I double cleanse, but I’m toying with the idea of one day trying out lash extensions.. meaning I’d have to drop my oil cleanser which I’m not okay with. I heard about this product how it has no oils but can still work as the first step in double cleansing so I had to try it. I found it works best with some kind of cleansing cloth, cause when I use my fingers it kind of just glides everywhere without fully getting off my waterproof mascara. It’s very gentle and hydrating, but when used with a cleansing cloth (with light manual power, gotta treat those eyes well!), powerful enough to take off everything. I love how it leaves my skin feeling nourished.. I may just switch to this regardless of trying lash extensions out or not!"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"At first I didn’t find much of a difference between this and all the other cleansing balms, but I love how easy and clean this is to use. I don’t rinse it, I found that makes it really hard to take off. I use a hot towel, and the heat from the towel removes everything so much easier and makes my skin feel really smooth and hydrated."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Malaysia,Ok product ,"This product helped remove my make up, but I really had to rub my face with it. When I washed it off it left a grimy, slippery film on my face so it’s definitely a product that needs to be washed off with another cleanser to get that clean feel. Kind of overpriced for something that doesn’t work as well as other brands. "
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Singapore,nope,"I did not wiped off mac waterproof mascara . Nope nope nope . For the price, Sephora make up removers are waaaaaayyy better ! It feels like applying moisturiser . "
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Canada,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I just used this not too long ago, got it mini size from a promo code and wow, not only is it soo cute in a mini size but was amazing. nice & smooth and rinses off very nicely! i really liked it. note; i wasn’t wearing any makeup... but still, nice smooth formula and makes your skin soft! after this, i applied peter thomas roth retinol fusion pm and laneige lip mask and into bed for the night! overall, it’s wonderful and doesn’t give me any reactions or stinging."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Malaysia,so so,Not effective for me. Does nothing.                                                                                                                                     
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,Smell really nice. It didn’t take off my magnetic liner that well but all my other liners and foundation it did. Makes your skin feel soft and not so dry after wiping off. I still use another face wash after for that real clean feel but depending on how much makeup you have on this one is great for a more simple makeup remover. Very gentle on the skin.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Amazing oil cleanser if used properly!,"I really like this makeup remover! I'm used to using Asian brand oil based makeup removers and I couldn't get my usual one fast enough. I got this bc I like a thicker texture and I couldn't be happier with it. It smells amazing, like citrus, and it emulsifies great. The bottle being translucent is a plus. Anyone saying this is greasy or hard to wash off isn't using it properly. This should be the first step in a double cleanse and should have small amount of water mixed with it after its been applied all over a dry face. After its been throughly emulsified, then rinsed with water and then wash face with a regular cleanser. If you do it correctly then there shouldn't be a residue left over."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,HOLY GRAIL CLEANSER,"This is the best cleanser I've ever used in my entire life. It gives skin an interesting texture - a sebum-esque ""film"" - that at first made me fear the product couldn't be properly washed off and which might lead to clogged pores, but after two weeks, not only has this never happened, I have also never felt my skin better protected, more rejuvenated and healthier. This cleanser really leaves your skin feeling like a baby's bottom - smooth, supple, clean, and well hydrated. Can't express my love enough! 

*Many comments say this can't remove makeup well. I believe this product is only meant to be a cleanser and maybe a remover for very light makeup (brows, light eyeshadows, etc.), but not heavy face makeup."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"I was looking forward to trying this product as the concept is unique. Although it hydrates, it definitely does the bare minimum at removing makeup. I hardly noticed any of my makeup being removed with this. There's also the fact that you still have to wipe your face with a cloth afterwards. Overall, it is a great concept. However, it has very little power in actually ""melting away"" any makeup."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,I got to try this product as free sampleI loved it so much it works well did not leave my face greasy or rough and dry took make up off easy
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Didn't remove all my makeup,"I tried Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare
Hyaluronic Marine Makeup Removing Meltaway Cleanser, and although the product felt moisturizing to my skin, it didn't remove all my makeup, which required me to still use another cleanser afterwards. The cleanser has the consistency of a lotion and doesn't suds up, which would be fine if it cleansed thoroughly, but it didn't in my case."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,"Removes makeup well, non-greasy, very emollient","Dr Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Makeup Removing Meltaway Cleanser does a great job removing my makeup without leaving my skin greasy or sticky. I have a combination skin and this product works very well on my dry zone but it is a little too emollient for every day use in my oily t-zone. I now use it every three days or so, and alternate it with a different type of cleanser and this routine has been working very well for me. I recommend this cleanser, especially for dry to normal skin."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,it’s a no,"it doesn’t remove my lancôme mascara at aaaall - the cleanser itself is very moisturizing but for what i needed it to do, nope!! i highly recommend the clinique cleansing oil in its place"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Great product for removing makeup!!,"I really liked how Dr. Dennis Gross' Meltaway Cleanser felt on my skin, it removed my makeup fairly quickly.  I have combination skin and the only thing that I didn't like was that after application it left my face a little bit greasy, even after I washed it. Besides that overall, I thought it was a good product and I really liked the scent!"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,"3.5 Stars, super emollient","I received this free from PINCHme.  I wanted to give this 3.5 stars, because i am really on the fence. If you have super dry skin (mine is combination) this is seriously for you! Major moisture did not serve me well this summer, but this winter may be a different story, which is why I kept it. Dr. Dennis Gross is a fabulous skin brand and I love their offerings; however, this was just too emollient for me personally. But who knows, because this winter it could turn out to be just what I need, so even though I gave this 3.5 stars, it could be a lifesaver eventually."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Sensitive friendly on face,Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare melt away cleanser actually does what it said and melted away my makeup. Even removed my waterproof mascara without consuming 10 minutes on each eye. I recommend it for even sensitive skin and acne prone skin. The thing I liked best is it’s scent free!
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,I received a bottle of Dr.Dennis Gross Skincare Hyaluronic Marine Makeup Removing Meltaway Cleanser for free from pinchme in exchange for my review. I love how quickly this cleanser wiped off my makeup. It doesn’t feel greasy. I would definitely recommend this cleanser to anyone.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Canada,For those saying this is greasy.....,"One of the first ingredients is ethylhexyl palmitate which is used in very popular name brand cleansing balms. 
When this first came out, it never gave me the impression of a one step cleanser but as a first cleanse to remove makeup/sunscreen. 

I mean, unless you have dry skin like the Sahara desert, it’s no wonder it’s breaking you out or leaving an “oily” film. 
It may say it’s oil free but research ethylhexyl palmitate and you’ll come to find that it can be a very pore clogging ingredient, especially if not properly rinsed from the skin! 

Cliniques cleansing balm, it cosmetics and many others use this same ingredient as the base for their makeup removing power! 

I think this cleanser works great when used as a first step! Removes makeup and sunscreen fast and easy! 
Since I’m more sensitive I’m more concerned with the citrus ingredients but not everyone is sensitive and it’s a big misconception that they sensitive over time. 
Otherwise, excellent product!"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"I love this to remove my waterproof mascara. I use a less expensive cleanser on my face, but nothing works as well as this for my eyes! And no water required. No leftover residue or greasiness either! LOVE."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,too greasy,This product had such a high rating I thought I would try it. The cleanser left my face feeling like it was greasy? I rinsed it off several times. It did remove my makeup. I'm not sure if I would purchase this cleanser again. It's just not for me
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,New staple in my night time routine,I actually love this.   Smells good feels fantastic on my skin and it does remove alot more of my base products than my regular micellar water or sprays .. I received this from pinchme gave the sample to my mother and she raved about it so much I actually bought it for myself and I will continue to use this in place of my usual makeup remover. A bit pricey compared to the alternatives but completely worth it
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Awesome,I love Dr Dennis Gross products! This cleanser works very well and removes my makeup!
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Great Cleanser,This cleanser works great and removes makeup on my face. It is easy to wash off and after using it my face feels clean. This product gets rid of my makeup better than other products that I have used. I'm happy with the results and will buy it again!
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Canada,Disappointed,"I wanted to love this cleanser, but unfortunately after several attempts of using it I am going to have to either return or discard. I have broken out significantly, after working very hard to clear up my face and I believe its due to this cleanser. Even after rinsing multiple times, it still feels like there is a thick film left on my face and that my makeup has just been moved around - not removed. I usually end up using a wipe after to remove what is left of my makeup. Its not for me..."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,MUST TRY!,"I absolutely love how clean and fresh my skin feels after this! It's surprisingly gentle and hydrating. It left my skin feeling cleansed but not stripped of ALL necessary oils. It didn't itch, tingle, or burn at all."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,This makeup remover does the trick! It isn’t harsh or drying on my skin instead it leaves it feeling soft and clean. It has a nice light smell and hasn’t caused any sort of breakouts yet after using for 3 weeks.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"This product did a wonderful job at removing my facial dirt but, not 100 percent on the makeup. It has a light pleasent scent and I love how you don't have to wash your face after using it. My skin felt so clean and fresh. I removed my makeup and then would use this for the dirt and oils on my face. I absolutely love the way my face felt and looked after using it."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,It's Awesome!! Worked very well at removing my makeup. I thought it would dry out my skin but the hyaluronic acid made my skin feel very supple.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,It works very well!,This makeup remover works! It is gentle and easy to use. Also the natural ingredients helps to keep my skin soft. It is good for all skin types. I recommend.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Great for dry skin,"This DR DENNIS GROSS MELTAWAY CLEANSER works pretty well.  It removes my makes up without drying my skin at all.  I didn’t see difference in my skin right away, but after a few days of use, I feel like my skin looked more “glowy.”  I like the smell as well."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Pretty good,This product worked pretty good. I love the fresh scent. It removes make up with no problem. The only thing I didn't like about the product is the oily feel afterwards. I love the look of moisturized skin but not the feel.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"I loved the texture of this cleanser but it didn't remove all of my makeup. I am no stranger to a double cleanse routine and loved the barely-there watery texture, but I was left with raccoon eyes (and I barely wear any makeup these days). I've used plenty of makeup removing balms and oils that have worked better, and though I love Dr. Gross products usually, I'll pass on this one."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,works well,This Hyaluronic Marine™ Makeup Removing Meltaway Cleanser works well tp remove makeup and leave face feeling clean and fresh with no greasy feeling afterwards.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,Canada,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,Such an amazing makeup remover! I was nervous to commit to buying this product at first because I have always used oil based makeup removers. I’m so happy I made the jump to purchase this! It has such a refreshing light scent to it and feels so light on your skin. Removes all my makeup perfectly even if I’m wearing a full glam heavy look with waterproof makeup. This will be my go-to makeup remover from here on out!
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,worth trying!,I really like this cleanser because it doesn’t leave my skin dry like others! It is very gentle and easy to use. I prefer using it as a double cleanser because it works great when it comes to removing makeup. I’m not sure if this is something I would use on its own though. I can feel that it cleans my skin but It does leave some residue. Overall I think it’s a great addition to my skincare routine! The fact that my skin doesn’t have a lot of redness once I’m done with my skin cleanse routine it’s a win for me.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"Great cleanser, gently removes dirt, oil and makeup.  Leaves skin soft and not tight.  I have sensitive skin and it did not cause redness or irritation."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,The best cleanser,"I love this cleanser! It really removed the dark makeup around my eyes well, which I look for. I like the ingredients and the feel on my skin. I will be buying some and I highly recommend it."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"I love Dr Dennis Gross products as they’re high quality and reasonable in price. This meltaway cleanser might be my favorite product from this brand. It’s supposed to remove makeup and oils when applied to dry skin, which I wasn’t convinced by, but it works really well to remove face and eye makeup. You only need a little, and it smells nice and leaves your skin feeling smooth."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Good cleanser,"I used this for a week and I have to say, no irritants and really cleaned my face well."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Mild Yet Effective,"I always love trying new skincare and makeup products, so I was thrilled to give this cleanser a try. It is extremely gentle on the skin and  does a good job of cleansing my face as well as leaving it feel hydrated. This cleanser had a nice, light scent to it which is not for everyone, especially if one has sensitivities to scent.
I would have liked it if the cleanser had some foaming action once applied to the skin, but other than that, it's a really nice product that is easy on the skin. I felt more like I was putting moisturizer on my skin because of the lack of suds, but I got used to it after a few washes. 
Nice product and I would recommend it."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"I’ve used this cleanser several times, and I really like it. It’s contains hyaluronic acid, marine algae, kiwi, and aloe. It’s also free of a lot of harmful 
ingredients, and is good for all skin types. It easy to apply, and gets rid of oil, dirt, and waterproof makeup. What’s great about this cleanser is you don’t have to rinse just wipe with a washcloth. Overall, it’s a great cleanser for removing makeup, it works great while moisturizing your skin."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Nice Natural and Gentle Cleanser,I was very impressed with this product. The ingredients are natural and it is easy to use. It left my skin soft and moisturized. I love the marine botanicals and hyaluronic acid! Mt skin is combination and can be temperamental at times and this product caused no irritation or problems at all. It is gentle on the skin and a little goes a long way.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,PLeasantly surprised!,"I was pleasantly surprised by this cleanser! I have sensitive skin, so I'm nervous at times about trying products that I've never heard of before on my face. This product was gentle, and left my skin clean, smooth and moisturized. Will definitely be a staple for me now!"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Great on skin!,"If you do not want a cleaner that will dry out your skin, this is the cleaner for you.  You won't get the lather you may be used to but it does a great job of cleaning without it.  This is a great cleaner for your skin.  It actually helped my skin feel moisturized."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"I enjoyed using Dr Dennis Makeup removing meltaway cleanser, for the most part. It did definitely melt away the makeup for the day.  The problem that came with this product was feeling like I had a layer on my skin that I couldn't rinse off.i ended up using this before my purge facial wash and even then the layer was still there.  I am continuing to use the product but I won't be buying."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Dr. Dennis Gross Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser - 150ml,"The creamy, greasy texture was a hard no for me. This left my skin feeling greasy and disgusting, not fresh and clean. I did not feel like it did a great job removing makeup either. I felt the need to rewash my face with another cleanser after using this."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Simple But Effective,"I had the opportunity to try Dr. Dennis Gross Meltaway Cleanser. At first, the cleanser felt very hydrated to my dry skin. It was simple and easy to apply to my face without feeling the cleaning sensation too strong when applying it close to my eyes. I was also amazed at how effectively the cleanser is in cleaning waterproof makeup,"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Makeup Meltaways,"I have tried few Dr. Dennis Gross products and love them and this Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Hyaluronic Marine™ Makeup Removing Meltaway Cleanser is no exception. Its very easy and convenient to use, no rinsing needed. However, I prefer to wash my face after massaging this on to wash away little sticky feeling and any residue left over. So, guess it comes to personal preference if you want to rinse after or no. Skin feels so clean, fresh and hydrated. Smell is nice, not very overpowering and texture is great too, easy to apply and work with. I have combination skin and so far no breakouts or any other issues using this cleanser. I like the ingredients and love my skin is loving it. Give it a try!"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Very hydrating.,"This cleanser is very hydrating and does not dry out my skin at all. It actually feels like you’re using a cream or a moisturizer on your face. When I wash it off, my skin feels plump and nourished which makes me happy. It’s so gentle and cleanses the skin very well. I love it and I think it’s something one could use daily without any worries."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-Hyaluronic Marine Meltaway Cleanser,USA,Moisturizing,Hydrating makeup removing cleanser that melts away my full face make-up. It has a creamy texture and I had to finish washing my face with soap to remove the heavy sticky-ish feeling. It does have a harder time removing all the residue from waterproof eyeliner but removes lipstick really well.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Singapore,unsure?,been using for a while and i’m not sure what to think?? it’s great and even quite hydrating but i have a feeling it’s not helping with my pores so much. like they’ve gone down a bit- but not as much as i was hoping
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Singapore,Mdm,Incredibly good! A big cystic stubborn bulge that appeared during the time of the month settled overnight and with religious use of twice a day by 3rd day it was down. 
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,Works Wonders,Omg I've been using this thing for like a month now and I had REALLY bad skin and cystic acne and everything and this has done such a beautiful job cleaning it up I totally recommend it if it works for you and it doesn't have any funky smells or textures either. Love it 🫶 The first picture is the before and after so you can see :) ALSO PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use sunscreen if you don't your skin will peel and hurt like crazy (I recommend the Supergloop Glow Screen) <33
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,Unique and great,"I didn’t get it at first but now I love it, works great on the black/white heads on my face but also hydrates my skin so good"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,Terrible,The worst. Feels like a layer of grease that sits on top of your skin. Did nothing for me and tossed in the trash.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,WORKS!!!!,Ive been threw a few of these and it is great. Helps with acne and after using it for a while i can see my acne scars slowly going away.￼
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,👍,Its gentle on your skin (works for sensitive skin & for teenagers). I noticed a difference in my pores and acne shortly after using it. It looks greasy on your skin tho it takes a while for it to absorb.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,Just okay.,It’s just ok. A little greasy. I like the vitamin C from la roche posay better.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,Greasy and sits on top of skin,This product is gross.  Even using a few drops whatever oil they use in it sits on your skin for hours. I had to go back and wipe my face off after 3 hours before bed because it was still floating on top of my skin.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,Love,Definitely notice a difference with my pores. Love switching between this and some other Ordinary serums.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,I'll pass,it goes on very oily. A little bit goes a long way. I don't like as I feel my skin gets too slick from use. It's supposed to be the opposite.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,Great results,"I was previously using The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Exfoliating Blemish Solution. It wasn't giving me great results, so thought I'd try this one. I am impressed. My skin texture, as well as acne has improved significantly. I only use this once daily, in my nighttime routine, because I find that it balls up under my primer/makeup for daytime and is a bit too oily for daytime use for me. I use this first, wait a few minutes, and layer on the Ordinary Niacinamide 10%+Zinc 1% serum, wait a few, then apply the Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2%. I have been using almost 4 weeks now."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Singapore,good experience,"enjoyed my experience using this product so far! have been using it for about a week or so. I usually put it on during the night time but only just saw the description which says to use it morning and evening. either way, it's really useful and I've also noticed that it helps to exfoliate my skin really well! "
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Singapore,love love love!,I brought this many times and enjoyed every bit of it. Recommended to mum and she is LOVING IT! Thank you creating a very good product! A must to try!!!
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Singapore,okok la,"i was told tht this is a good one fr oily skin? but then the gel turned out to be oily based.. i thought tht its suppose to be water based product fr oily skin.. but the promoter gave this to me fr purchase. but its fine, i seen ppl saying it works on oily skin too.. so im just using it at my night routine i guess"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Philippines,great! ,"I have dry acne prone skin and this product has just done WONDERS on my skin! This does have an oil-like texture so it will take a little bit longer to absorb. With that said do apply less (1-2 drops instead of the usual 2-3) and wait a bit before layering. 

Highly recommended!!! 👌🏽"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,No,Do not use if you have sensitive skin I had just a few bumps on my skin so I started using this to clear up and it made it noticeably worse. Once I stopped using this my skin cleared up significantly
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,Incredible Product,"Just as amazing, if not better, than the original product. In just 2 days my skin is clear and I’m so happy! Despite the negative reviews, I implore you to try it."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,A new must have,After only 3 days of using this I can tell a huge difference in my skin. My skin was broke out really bad when I started it and usually whenever I have a breakout it lasts for a while but after the next day my breakout didn't seem to get any worse & my acne is already healed. I can already tell a difference in the blackheads on my nose as well and my skin feels amazing & hydrated.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,"LOVE! Noticed a difference after one day. Made my skin look so beautiful after each use. I don’t get why people are saying it’s too oily, just use less and spread it out evenly, your pores will eventually suck the product in. I’ll keep buying this FOREVER <3!"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,I love this product my skin is pretty good but when my pores get clogged up this clears in in a day and yiu only need a little bit
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,Oil slick! My skin broke out!,"I was using the Niacinamide Serum and really liked it; I tried this new one because I was looking to shrink pores on my combo-skin and heard SA was good stuff. Noooo. This is meant for someone with DRY skin. It felt so oily on my T-zone that I had to blot/wipe it with a Kleenex. I got instant, painful pimples on forehead, nose, lip area, chin. I’m going back to the Niacinamide until I find something better"

THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,Hit or miss…,Some days I feel like it is working and other days I’m not sure. I do like that it doesn’t have much of a scent.￼
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Singapore,works ,"i find it effective on pimples - i apply a small dot and notice they become smaller the next day. as expected, it's pretty oily given its liquidy texture... but a little goes a long way and it's pretty worth its price"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,Softening and non-irritating,"I can't compare this to the original formulation but I've enjoyed this one so far. I like how hydrating it feels on the skin, and it absorbs pretty quickly. I use this on alternating days with a topical retinol as well and I feel like it does a good job to exfoliate. Doesn't irritate the skin like other exfoliants."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Singapore,Value for money and effective product,"This product which I have been using for some time, has made my skin smoother and less uneven. It has also helped in making my skin look less tired and aged and is something I would recommend to others "

THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,"this really helped my skin clear up and i’m noticing my
pores shrinking, i 100% love this product"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Singapore,Okay,"Not exactly sure how good this is. I used it a few times and my skin got tan easily. You need to have a very good sunscreen apparently. So currently, I have stopped using it. "
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,oily and leaves buildup!,This is oily and will require an oil cleanser to remove! What a drag. Their original formula was amazing. This leaves a lot of build up on my skin.

So happy to have found it and I know now I can have clear skin!
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,pores are living,My pores and skin have definitely been loving this I use 2 drops to put a thin layer on my face at nighttime.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,Awesome,Blemishs gone away ... love this serum.. before i was worring about its result .. then my sis in law suggested me to try once .. it is woderful
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,Make sure this product is for YOUR skin type!,"This is a oil -based treatment, so I don’t know why people who are extremely oily are even trying it, tbh. It’s a non-drying formula for dry skin. Most people seem to be complaining about it being greasy because they have oilier skin or they’re complaining that it doesn’t smell good. People constantly complain about skincare having fragrance, and then if it isn’t included, people whine that it doesn’t smell good. It smells like nothing to me, but that’s besides the point- if it doesn’t have fragrance, it’s likelihood of irritating the skin is lower. If you don’t want fragrance, you have to expect and deal with a formula that isn’t going to be olfactively pleasing. You can’t have it both ways.

Personally, I have been using this in place of the very expensive salicylic oil from Sunday Riley and so far, so good. I haven’t had any issues with it yet and I think it’s similar in its effectiveness."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,New Must Have,I love this product. For the past about two years I have struggled with blackheads and had no idea how to help with the problem. Once I got this product they started to shrink. I use it morning and night after I wash my face. It’s definitely a must have product.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,meh…,"not a fan! i have oily and acne prone skin and LOVED the old ordinary salicylic acid serum and i saw they came out with this and thought i’d try it. made my skin have little bumps all over it and now my skin is rough and textured. 
will be exchanging for the water-based salicylic acid serum."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,"Smells unpleasant, worked for a bit and then I actually broke out worse. Stuck with it since sometimes things get worse before they get better but no cigar. Although affordable there are better products out there and would suggest skipping."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,SO greasy (oily skinned people beware),"As an already oily-skinned girl, this serum leaves my skin SO greasy. I would never be able to use this in the morning/before putting on makeup, and when I use it in the evening, it just leaves me feeling greasy & gross. No matter how much I massage it into my skin, it never completely absorbs. I will switch to The Ordinary’s other salicylic acid products to see if I have better luck."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,wanted to save money,This smells like an old couch stuffed with chalk. 3 episodes of “Virgin River” later and I can still smell it.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,I used to get a ton of red inflamed pimples on my face but I’ve been using this product as a preventative measure for 3 months and I rarely notice any pimples. The price is a plus!
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,severe adult cystic acne GONE,"I struggle with severe cystic acne. I have been using this product for 6 weeks & my acne is GONE! I'm shocked every time I look in the mirror... nothing helped. For 20 years I was either covered in pimples, wounds and scars... or wearing a full face of makeup. 

Not only has my acne improved, but my skin is truly healthier. At first, The Ordinary products sat on top of my skin - my skin couldn't absorb them. Now my skin soaks them right up. I haven't had a breakout in a weeks & scarring is improving.

Here is how I introduced the products to avoid a flare up. 
#1 CerVe Foaming cleanser. I kept my facial cleanser. It's cheap, it's gentle, it works & everyone in my house uses it. 
#2 Niacinamide 10% with Zinc 1%: I introduced this first. I waited 3 days then...
#3 Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Pore Clearing Serum. I have dry skin, & every other salicylic acid product I have ever used has made my acne much worse. This product is different!  I waited 3 more days, then I introduced...
#4 AHA 30% + BHA 2% Exfoliating Peeling Solution. I started with 3 minutes. After 3 more days, I introduced...
#5 Granactive Retinoid* 2% Emulsion. I waited 2 weeks (until after my ""purge"" where I had a pretty bad breakout) to introduce...
#6 Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA. This feels a little to rich for my skin. I use it after the Peel, and a little under my eyes.

My AM routine
1) CerVe Foaming Cleanser
2) Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%
3) Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Pore Clearing Serum (spot treat)
4) CerVe Ultra Light Face Lotion with SPF

My PM Routine
1) CerVe Foaming Cleanser
-Once a week: AHA 30% + BHA 2% + Exfoliating Peeling Solution. 10 min
2) Niacinamide 10% with Zinc 1%
3) Granactive Retinoid* 2% Emulsion
4) Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution Pore Clearing Serum
4) Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA (if my skin is thirsty) +  CreVe Ultra Light PM Face Lotion (if my skin is normal)

I hope this helps someone! 

Thank you The Ordinary!!!"

THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,Good for acne prone skin,"I have acne prone skin. This helped me with lighting acne marks and even dries your acne faster.. I used this every other day but it made my skin a little dry so added cosrx snail serum to my daily routine and my skin texture changed completely..  very good 
product"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,Mediocre,I don’t know if it’s because I’m sensitive to smells but it has a chemical kind of smell. This one made my skin oily. I would recommend for people with dry skin.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,Helped to clear my acne and leaves a beautiful glow on my skin!
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Singapore,so glowyyyy,"This is so gooodddd, makes my face glow, and last long for-nhoursssss. I apply it before sleep and when I wake up, I do it. You can see the difference with in few days "
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,good to use if taken regularly everyday.no side effects.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,No-frills spot treatment,"I use this as a spot treatment, and I’ve been super happy with it! It’s a super cheap alternative to other spot treatments. In general, I love the Ordinary’s no-frills formulas, and this is definitely a good one for me!"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,Ok,"Seems ok, but I haven't really noticed any benefit from use after 1 month."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,"Not sure if it’s made any difference for me, and I don’t love the feel of it. Doesn’t feel like it absorbs into my skin at all"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Singapore,The Ordinary Salicylic acid anhydrous 2%,Great for those with skin which are not use to acid as it is pretty gentle on skin. Skin became smoother.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,"Superrr good with helping unclog pores to prevent breakouts and helps with acne scars. The only downside is it makes my nose a bit oily, but if you have dry skin or another serum to prevent oil you should be fine :)"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,Works great for when I have a break out. I also use on my nose to help with pores and it works
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,just no.,"I really wanted to like this but it ended up doing the opposite of what it’s supposed to. It clogged my pores, gave me black heads and made me brake out. I do have acne and wanted to give this a try. I noticed my face was way better after I stopped using this and started using a charcoal tea tree soap from my local farmers market. Highly disappointed."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,WORKS FOR CYSTIC HORMONAL ACNE,"This product is unreal. I suffer from very painful hormonal cystic acne on my chin and jaw line since I hit my 30s. They would never come to a head and would stay on my face for weeks as hard bumps. I started using this solution and I am SHOOK. I massage a small amount at night on the spot(s), and within 2-3 days it comes to a head. It gently exfoliates the area and doesn't dry out my face. I have been using it for a few months and have rarely had a breakout, but when I do, this stuff is a miracle"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Singapore,great but smells bad ,"bought this yesterday in stores and did a patch test which works well but after 15 minutes, it started to smell so bad. idk if i will be using it though, i can’t stand the smell, especially it being on my face. "
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,Awesome!,"I’ve been using this for the past two weeks and it has done wonders on my skin. I have combination skin so the downside is that my t zone is a little oily after, but I usually fix that with a little bit of setting powder. In my experience it has made makeup a little hard to stay on all day, but because of it I don’t even need to use my concealer that much anymore. Definitely recommend!"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,Oily all day,Bought this because the water soluble version was out of stock. It works well but it makes my skin super oily all day. I would only suggest using this if you have super dry skin.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,"Unfortunately, this serum hasn’t done anything for my skin. It’s been neither good nor bad, just a waste of a few dollars."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,5 stars !,"Absolutly love this! After using it for a few days, i felt and saw a difference. Great product for everyday cleaning and maintence"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,Great!,I decided to try this out because it claims it’s for Blemish-prone skin and I’m blown away because this is amazing it helped my acne scars like magic!
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Singapore,really did smooth my skin ,"very effective - texture is nice and smooth as well 

i noticed visibly my skin is smoother and i guess less blemishes 
with covid masks the blemish situation got bad hit this definitely  helped "
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,First time using it and I LOVE it! I’ve been having less breakouts
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,2 Thumbs Up!,It does what it’s supposed to do! I purchased this to clear up my tzone and it immediately started purging my skin. Not irritating at all for my sensitive skin which is great! Absorbs well. This is a very simple and effective solution.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,amazing product!!,"I love this serum!! I use it every night after I cleanse my face. It is a little oily but after a while, the serum absorbs into your skin. There is a light salicylic acid smell to it. After using it, I’ve seen so many improvements!! My skin is a lot more clear and bright. Salicylic acid helps with acne so this is perfect! I would definitely buy again!"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,Horrible,"Awful. Smells of old oil, like it wasn't properly stored. Not possible to check if it works, threw it to the trash. Very disappointed."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,"Haven’t seen any results yet, the texture makes my skin very oily and smells really bad"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,So Good!,"REALLY good! Can’t believe it works this well, considering the cheap price. It has done wonders for the appearance of blackheads and breakouts. I have combination skin btw. Will continue to buy :)"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Singapore,serum,it is honestly abit too oily for my liking. one drop onto a cotton pad already makes my face super oily and my shade appears to be darker than usual. not sure if it has improved my skin but quite affordable and a good start for people trying to get into skincare!
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,Amazing,The salicylic Acid helped with my acne and my pores on my nose got cleared up.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,changed my skin!,I’ve had acne since my teens and other salicylic acid products always made my skin so dry. I’ve been using this serum for almost a month and already i’ve seen improvements in my skin. Works great on my face and my shoulders and back.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,I have back and shoulders acne it worked very well on it
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,doesn't do anything,"this product really hasn't done anything for my skin aside from making it a bit shiny until i wipe it off. i was expecting the salicylic acid to be significantly more potent, but this feels and acts more like straight up squalene"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Singapore,Not sure if its working?,"This was recommended by a staff at ION outlet as I told them I have to deal with dark spots, pores, sometimes break outs, and my oily skin type. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now, and the results are not very obvious yet."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,I really thought it was gonna work for me but unfortunately not.It’s very oily and I don’t need more oil added to my face .It caused me a bit of irritation.Wouldn’t but again
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,Doesn’t really work. The texture is weird as it’s very oily. Feels heavy on the face. Avoid!
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,Continued use helped clear some of my stubborn acne a bunch and did not irritate my skin.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,Made me break out really bad,"I have very dry, sensitive skin and get acne breakouts (half are cystic). I don't have many issues with The Ordinary products and love acid products. I rated this low since it didn't do as stated and made me break out horribly.
I used this in certain areas as a patch test. No issues or stinging when put on product. After about 5-6 days I had broken out where I put it. I think it's the oil-- however it's rare I break out like THAT. I'm just going to try the regular Salicylic Acid since I've never had an issue with AHAs and BHAs serums."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,reduced my hormonal acne,"Works great! 
I just bought my second bottle! I have been getting hormonal acne since the pandemic and this and with other products reduced the amount I was getting- virtually zero now."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,"while this didn’t break me out, it also didn’t do anything for my skin. I have pretty much constant acne on my chin and was looking for something that would help. This makes my skin feel and look very oily, and did nothing to clear my acne."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,Greatly Recommend!!,"I had really bad acne on my nose and forehead, after only a few day using this serum/oil, it healed it completely! It’s amazing and I would buy it again."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,Absolutely yes!,"This product is a God sent!! I’ve noticed, in just days, what a difference this serum has made! I highly recommend!"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,Hydrating and helped with cystic acne!,"This is such a good serum!! It’s not a miracle solution but it’s really good for what it is. You only need a little bit since it is an oily formula, and I usually mix it with my moisturizer at night as well to offset the texture. My acne has been really cystic and deep from wearing medical masks but I’ve been getting less since I started adding this to my regimen. It’s taken a few weeks, but my skin is noticeably softer and smoother to the point where people have commented on it. Definitely great for adding hydration and getting rid of deep acne!"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,HG acne spot treatment,does what its meant to do for a really great price. at the first sign of a breakout i'd use this as a spot treatment and it'll stop the breakout in its path! and if i already have a pimple it dries it out almost overnight 10/10
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,LIQUID GOLD,"I don’t usually write reviews, but I have to say this product is a WONDER! I struggle with uneven skin texture and learned salicylic acid is a product for this. After cleansing, I’ll put a few drops in my hands, rub them together and gently massage it into my whole face. Been using this for a whole month and have now noticed a huge difference!! Don’t hesitate!! This serum is GOLD!"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,DRY SKIN ACNE SUFFERERS REJOICE,"Tired of every single acne product being made for oily skin? Me too. I had given up on salicylic acid years ago because every other product with it has been too drying on my sensitive dry skin, but not this one! This is the only product that's cleared up my acne after trying everything under the sun (this is 10+ years after 2 Acutane courses that have left my skin perpetually dry but still breaking out). Holy grail. I hope The Ordinary never stops selling this because I truly don't think there's anything similar on the market."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,HOLY GRAIL,"this product is amazing! I had a really bad breakout from another skincare product and this has been the only thing that has cleared it up. 
I love using this as a spot treatment or if I have a large area to cover I’ll mix a drop or two into my face cream and apply it that way. It can be a bit drying if you’re heavy handed with it, less is more with this product!"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,Smells horrible but works great. I would recommend to anyone who is acne prone even if it’s just a little. I have bumps that don’t get white heads usually and it works for those.
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,BUY IT,I’ve been using this consistently in the AM and PM after washing my face as the directions say to do for a month now and my skin has never been so clear. I saw a big difference in just 4 days. I went from having swollen inflamed breakouts to small scabby spots to now very little to no blemishes at all. As some people mentioned it will bring all breakouts to the surface then clear; for me this took about a week but I never at any point felt like the condition of my face wasn’t improving. TRUST THE PROCESS AND STICK WITH IT YOU WONT BE SORRY. I have been on spironolactone for years and in the past month using this regimen I’ve been able to stop taking it all together and remain clear. I wish I would’ve found this extremely affordable solution sooner!
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution - 30ml,Love!! I was scared to buy it at first because I have very sensitive skin but I’ve been using it every night with their hyaluronic acid serum and my acne is already looking better!
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,love!!,"A fair warning, it might make you break out for a bit before your skin starts to clear, it’s because the serum is kicking all your congestion into the outer layer of your skin! That’s what happened to me. also, this is more like an oily serum than a normal drying serum, so I only use it at night, and I think that might be useful for some to know that! But it goes on nicely and I really feel like it helps my skin more than any other acne products I’ve tried. Everyone’s skin is different though:)"
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,excellent,works even better than the original product.  Also excellent on my teenagers skin as it moisturizes
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,USA,best spot treatment serum!!!,"this is quite literally the best acne clearing product i have EVER used on my face. i have extremely dry skin, and every product used to fight acne, especially cheaper products, tends to dry out the acne therefore creating a dry patch. i have been using this every night for a week, and my skin has almost CLEARED. i had two really bad whiteheads that would not go away for about two weeks, and in two days this serum has completely brought them down to a small red bump. it has also helped minimize dark spots (working alongside my other skin care). i use the smallest amount and it goes a long way. will definitely recommend to everyone with dry skin and acne/breakouts."
THE ORDINARY-Salicylic Acid 2% Anhydrous Solution,Canada,Meh,"Didn’t do anything for me, except for making me break out a bit."
LANCÔME-Clarifique Pore Refining Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Pricey but a lil' goes a long way.,"Really burn a hole in your pocket but you only need very little to foam up a LOT. So it is 'economical' - only if you can afford it. Currently using it, and it is my third tube. Still deciding if I wanna reorder or look for something else. Makes my skin feel fresh and not tight. Pores remain the same though lol."
LANCÔME-Clarifique Pore Refining Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Awesome,"Im in love!! No need to use a lot, just a few and it will create more soap and its enough to cover all ur face. Overall is nice and not irritate my skin. I have combination skin, oily at T-zone and dry on cheeks. Please buy, its good "
LANCÔME-Clarifique Pore Refining Cleansing Foam,Singapore,A small bean size amount is all you need,"I think this cleanser can last for months as I only need a bean size amount to create a rich lather. Surprisingly, this is able to remove my non waterproof make up that I could skip my make up remover. This cleanser will not make your skin tight or squeaky, plus point. What I do not like about this is the scent, smells like wild botanical grass to me, probably the key ingredient french beech bud I supposed as the entire range I have smells the same. Could have been perfect for me, what a shame."
LANCÔME-Clarifique Pore Refining Cleansing Foam,Singapore,lancome cleansing foam,5 stars for this! gentle cleanser yet managed to cleanse my face well. Not the cheapest cleanser but def does its job well. my 3rd bottle and counting ! 
LANCÔME-Clarifique Pore Refining Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Lancome Clarique Pore Refining Cleansing Foam ,I am a oily and sensitive skin. It’s help to reduce my pore after several times of using it. The cleansing form doesn’t feel dry and no appearance redness on my face. 
LANCÔME-Clarifique Pore Refining Cleansing Foam,Singapore,little goes a long way,"you would only need a pea size for whole face , very luxurious texture and special scent. face left feeling clean and well balanced. love this range alot"
LANCÔME-Clarifique Pore Refining Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Nice facial wash,"I love lancome products. It suit my skin type. After cleansing my face with this facial wash, skin is soft and plump. Highly recommend. Just purchased another one. "
LANCÔME-Clarifique Pore Refining Cleansing Foam,Australia,absolutely loving it!,I bought this about a month ago and I've been using this since then both morning and night time. My skin gets softer after the use and I feel like my skin seems brighter than before.
LANCÔME-Clarifique Pore Refining Cleansing Foam,Singapore,it has a smell ,My first time purchasing this Lancôme Pore Refining Cleansing Foam. It has a weird smell maybe is from the ingredients used. Will not purchase again. 
LANCÔME-Clarifique Pore Refining Cleansing Foam,Singapore,awesome,i feel this is an upgrade version of the blanc expert series? price is steep but it delivers what it promises whede i feel it is better than the previous series
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,love love,honestly love this cleansing balm but it does leave a film that takes me some effort to get off
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Easy Peasy!,I am not surprised that it’s getting such fantastic reviews. It literally melted the make up off of my face and left my face feeling soft. It did not dry out my skin or make it feel sticky. Absolutely easy to rinse off. One of the best cleansers I’ve ever used.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,I love it as first step cleanser,"I have already a couple of cleansers that I love (both from Biossance), but they are my second step in my cleansing routing. I got a sample of this cleanser with a purchase and I really love it! This is perfect as my first step because it does an incredible job at cleaning all my makeup.
PROS:
It made an amazing job at cleaning all my makeup, including my waterproof mascara.
It didn’t dry out my skin.
A little goes a long way: I just need a little amount to remove my makeup.
It has skin loving ingredients.
Fragrance free.
Great price for the amount you get and the quality of the product.
Clean+planet positive.
Cruelty free
CONS:
It left a waxy feeling on my skin, but I don’t care because I use a second cleanser in my routine.
I am sharing my honest and authentic opinion as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Great!,"This stuff is great! amazing for taking off makeup at night, its gentle but gets the job done! I struggled with finding a effective way to take off makeup at night especially since I wear waterproof makeup and it can be a pain to get off but this stuff works amazing and I have sensitive/oily skin!"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,A must have!,"This very well could be my second review but it honestly deserves it. This stuff is the absolute holy grail of makeup remover or double cleansing, whatever you’re into! 
Sometimes I use it on the entire face and it quite literally MELTS your makeup right off or it works fabulous as just an eye makeup or lipstick remover if you’re trying to make it last longer. That being said, a little goes a looooong way! 
I’ve been using this for years and I cannot live without it — if you’re on the fence, just buy it!"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Great cleansing balm for sensitive skin,"Amazing balm! My makeup is usually limited to light primer, some highlighter, mascara, eyeliner & some brow gel, so I can't attest to it's ability to remove heavier makeup such as foundation, but it does an amazing job especially in removing my eye makeup. I have sensitive combination skin & I don't get any irritation or dryness at all after use, my skin actually feels amazing after use. Only reason I removed one star is that, unlike the Green Clean version, this one does leave a residue on the skin after use, so you need to follow up with a cleanser."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Holy Grail,"I absolutely love this stuff. Any form of it is great. I like this version for days when I have a headache or super sensitive skin and don't want the fragrance. Always use this as a step one cleanser in a double cleanse process. If you only use this, it's an oil, it will leave a film."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Does the job well...but...,Great for sensitive skin peeps. It gently and effectively removes makeup and sunscreen and washes away easily with water. However it leaves behind a waxy residue that im not a fan of. Thankfully this residue is easily removed by my second cleanser so it not too much of an issue
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Never going back,"Never going back to mincellar water to remove my makeup ever again. This product is the best for taking off makeup, I luv it!!!!"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Takes everything off with no effort,"Def one of my all time fav makeup removers !! Takes everything off easily without much/ any effort. Clean ingredients make my skin and soul happy. I switch between this , Clinique take the day off and the elf makeup remover. This one is probably my fav as it’s the only one that doesn’t leave a ton of ‘residue ‘ ( if you use balm to take off your makeup you know what I mean haha)"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,NAAAAUR,"￼I bought this one because I have VERY sensitive skin. Biggest mistake, ever. It doesn’t rinse off properly so it leaves an oily residue. The next Morning I woke up with the WORST texture."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,A must have in my routine,"This is the best makeup remover! It melts my makeup off so well and breaks down waterproof eyeliner, lash glue, liquid lipsticks and full coverage foundation. I’ve tried others and just keep returning to this one. Once I rinsed it off there is no residue or film left on my face."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"Love this product ,it slides the make up off with no effort"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,Can't really tell the difference between this and the original
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,THE BESTEST!,THE ABSOLUTE BEST! I don’t use nearly as much cleansing balm as i used to with another brand and it really melts everything off. Love that it’s clean too.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Singapore,LOVE IT,"i've been wanting to try this version of the cleansing balm because i really loved the green clean but because my face is sensitive, i try not to use too much fragrance in my skincare products. i have tried so many other cleansing balms/oils but nothing beats the farmacy one for me. i love this just as much as i love the green clean. will definitely repurchase when i'm done. "
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Great stuff!,Feels fresh and clean. Works with waterproof makeup to remove quickly and completely.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,A must-have,This is my favorite oil cleansing balm. I have oily/combination skin and I don't feel like this complicates things at all. I follow this cleanser with a salicylic cleanser at night and it's been such a worthwhile investment.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,STAY AWAY,"The worst cleansing balm/oil I have ever used. 
IT DOES NOT RINSE OFF! It leaves a thick oily residue on your skin. Also, that residue is extremely hard to remove, I couldn’t get all of it off using my micellar water. Right after cleansing, I noticed there were small bumps all over my face, which I have never gotten before.

How are people giving this good reviews??"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,1st Balm Experience,"This was my first experience with a balm and I didn’t know what to expect, I knew I didn’t like the results. After reading the reviews I realize it’s because this doesn’t emulsify, rinse well, and I had to go behind and wash my face good because the residue is greasy. I have heard good reviews of the Farmacy balm which led me to purchase although I am also realizing I didn’t buy the original/right product . May try that next time but will not repurchase this."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"removes make-up very well, not too harsh either. it doesn't rip off my eyelashes like some other removers do, also doesn't dry or break out my skin."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"Really wanted to like this product (I absolutely love green clean). However, this balm is NOTHING like the original. It left a thin (oily) film on my skin even after using a regular cleanser. Cannot recommend this product with the current formulation. Steer clear!"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,Love this stuff. Very gentle and doesnt leave any residue!
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,It gets the job done! Not my favorite but not bad by any means. I do have to double cleanse because this balm leaves a film on my face even after rinsing and I just don’t trust that lol.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"Really love this product, it removes all my makeup including eye makeup unlike some other reviews you sort of have to work your way into it and apply some warm water for max effects but overall great I love it"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,DOESN’T REMOVE MAKEUP AT ALL!!!!,What a waste of money! I wish I could return this. This product doesn’t not remove your make up at all!! Don’t waste your money on this. I don’t recommend.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,overpriced coconut oil,This didn’t rinde off completely and felt like there was residue left behind. It just seemed like expensive jar of coconut oil. Literally the same feeling I got from using coconut oil as a makeup remover. And not sure what ingredient would’ve made my skin burn but my skin was already feeling sensitive and after using this it felt extremely prickly and warm. Pass!
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,holy grail,I have seriously dry and dehydrated skin and I absolutely love this!! Purchased 3x. It thoroughly removes ALL my make up and doesn't strip moisture.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,ehhh,"it’s just a cleansing balm, i’ve tried better for cheaper but i’ve also tried worse for more expensive. skip this one if you already have a good balm"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Almost perfect...,"This is great for double cleansing. It does a wonderful job at removing all my makeup. Even waterproof mascara doesn't stand a chance! Although, it leaves this greasy film on after. If you only cleanse with a balm, this shouldn't be your go to. Otherwise, it works just fine!"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Great for dry skin!!,"Received a sample and got a few uses out of it. Works great! Make up and sunscreen come right off, I don't experience a waxy residue, it feels moisturizing. I rinse this off, pat dry then wash with Youth to the People's Superfood Cleanser and my skin feels hydrated. clean, and isn't stripped at all. I don't get the feeling this is intended to be used for a single cleanse,  you should double cleanse with it. well be buying a full size!"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"I got a sample of this stuff with my last purchase and was able to get a couple of uses out of it. I loved how easily and quickly my makeup came off and it left none behind!! The only complaint I have is that afterwards when washing my face it felt pretty oily and hard to rinse the product completely off unless scrubbing it with soap and water. For me it didn’t bother me to much since I have dry skin and love anything that can leave my skin a little hydrated and dewy. But if your oily, that’s something I would watch for"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,A new favourite,"Awesome. It doesn't make my eyes burn, melts quickly and doesn't leave that sort of film that most cleansing balms do. It takes off my sunscreen and make up very well"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"Bought this a couple of weeks ago and so far I like it! It’s a thicker balm, scent free, glides on the face very silky and removes all of my eye makeup and sunscreen. I use it as a first step, so I do follow up with a cleanser. Also comes with a little spatula to remove the product from the jar without sticking your fingers in there. I’d buy again and recommend as a 1st step in a double cleanse."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"soo good! this balm is so good bc it just MELTS your makeup off, even waterproof. i’ve tried many cleansing balms and this one works the best. the ONLY BAD THING is if u get it in ur eye it like blinds you temporarily."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Had potential :(,"I really wanted to like this balm. :( I’m experiencing the same issues as others who posted here — a waxy residue that no amount of rinsing and rubbing can remove. The feel of the balm itself is luxurious on the skin, but it’s completely overshadowed by the fact that it’s impossible to remove entirely. Even with a second/third round of cleansing, nothing happens."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,good product,It is a nice product and definitely gets the job done. I do not wear that much makeup so it worked well for me.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,i bought this thinking it was green clean :( don’t like the scent at all and it leaves a bit of residue.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,It’s good,"I decided to try this out because I do have sensitive skin. The ingredients are pretty good and I haven’t experienced any irritation or stinging on my hyper-sensitive areas. It does remove makeup and sunscreen really well but the reviews are true… it does leave a waxy film on the skin after rinsing. I use this as the first step to double cleanse, so my second cleanser gets rid of that residue anyway. For reference, I’m currently double cleansing with the dr. Jart+ tiger grass enzyme foam cleanser made for sensitive skin. On the days when my skin is extra sensitive and I want to use an extra gentle milky cleanser, such as the cerave or cetaphil hydrating cleanser consistency, it’s not enough to get rid of the waxy residue. I previously used the Tatcha oil makeup remover and I love that one but I wanted to try something new. I recommend this if you have sensitive skin AND double cleanse, just keep in mind it might not get rid of the residue if you use a really gentle cleanser, if you don’t, you should be fine to be honest. Overall, I think it’s good but I’m not crazy about it. I do want to try other cleanser balms and oils before I consider repurchasing this one."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,disappointed,"I was obsessed with original GC which always worked great for me!! However, I have very sensitive/acne prone skin so I was super excited about a fragrance free cleansing balm. This product did not work well at all for me. It just leaves a thick waxy layer of cleansing balm on my face. I will definitely be going back to the original cleansing balm. If looking for a cleansing balm I recommend the one with fragrance."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Not nearly as good as Green Clean,"I have used Green Clean for years, and accidentally grabbed this one.  Decided to try it out, but does not work for me at all. Totally broke me out like a teenager! I’m 49 and acne hasn’t been an issue until I started using this. Not sure what the ingredient is that’s causing this, but will be going back to the original ASAP."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"It does NOT rinse off!! It’s just stick to your face!! Terrible!! Very disappointed because I love the  original cleansing and have been using it for a long time. 
Not sure what happens with this one. Will never buy it again"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Original Is Better,"It’s okay… wanted to like it as much as the “Green Clean”, since it’s suppose to be better for sensitive skin, but it just doesn’t seem to work as well. Doesn’t remove makeup or wash off as easily. Used all of the original Green Clean with no problems, so I’ll go back to that once this is through. GC also has a heavenly smell that I’m missing. I guess fragrance isn’t always bad .. lol"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,It removes EVERYTHING!!!,"To put you into perspective as to why I chose this headline is because I wear a whole face of make-up. I wear two to three coats of Tarte's Lights, Camera, Splashes WTP mascara.
I also used Clinique's Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm but noticed that it takes a little more elbow grease to remove the mascara at the lash roots. I wanted to try something new. Also, I cannot use the OG Farmacy Cleansing Balm so I gave this one a shot.
A little goes a long way! A little amount, close to a dime size, removes & dislodges all of my makeup.  The last roots are mascara-free in little time. But! This is where this product is only 4 stars in my opinion, It's hard to wash off. I rinse and rinse and it doesn't come off right away.
I use the Original Make-Up Eraser too to make sure that the product is off my skin and that the towel, after that I wash my face, is completely clean.  
I forgot to mention that I also use this to remove the sunscreen on my face on make-up free days. It works like a charm.
If they update the formula to rinse off better, I would give it another try.  But I think I'll revert back to my Clinique Take the Day Off Cleaning Balm because even though I do need to work it a little more, I know that rinsing it off will be a breeze."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"I love this cleansing balm
I would give it a 5, but depending on the eyeliner that I'm wearing if I dont double clean, some product is left, invisible to the eye, but my eyes are dirty the day after.

But that is only for a few product, other than that it does a great job!"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,no!,Bought this on accident thinking it was the other balm. This does nothing but move my makeup around. I felt like I had to scrape my makeup off because my face just felt oily and gunky. The regular balm is truly a makeup remover
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"I really wanted to love this cleansing balm, and usually do opt for more fragrance free skincare products for the most part, but the two things I really could not get over with this product is that it was really difficult to get off once getting it on, and the smell of the balm was just very overwhelmingly strong, and not in a good way. If you’re sensitive to smells, use at your own risk."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Inferior product compared to Green Clean,"I accidentally bought this product thinking it was the amazing Green Clean balm. I noticed right away that the product is white (as opposed to green) and crumbles much more easily when you scoop out product than Green Clean. None of these were dealbreakers for me until I actually tried the product for its intended purpose. While it does remove stubborn makeup (including waterproof eyeliner, eyeshadow primer, and lash glue), it took two tries to get it all off as opposed to one when I used Green Clean. Additionally, it did not emulsify nearly as well as the Green Clean. I felt like it was moving makeup around on my face than actually lifting it off effectively. I've had to use the balm, rinse with water, pat my face dry, use the balm again, rinse with water again, and then follow up with a water-based cleanser to get the balm/makeup gunk off my face. This resulted in a longer and more tedious makeup removal process. After I finish this I won't repurchase and will probably go back to the Green Clean balm."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,AMAZING,Amazing product! My skin is so glows but not tight!
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Perfect for double cleansing,"Although I don’t wear makeup, I wanted to start double cleansing to better remove spf and sebum off my face. This was my first oil based cleansing balm I’ve tried, and I absolutely love it. Very VERY few products make an initial impressive on me ; I almost always have to wait at least a week before I can tell whether or not I like the product. However, this cleansing balm will leave your skin feeling insanelyyy soft. It really does an amazing job at removing the sebum and spf off my face and giving me a soft texture, something I’ve always struggled with!"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Melt the Day Away!,"This cleansing balm was a blind purchase and I am so glad I gave it a try! I am often experimenting with new skincare items and I rarely find a facial cleanser that really differentiates from others. This balm, however, easily became a new staple in my routine. I regularly wear a decent amount of makeup and this balm is very effective in removing what’s left on my skin at the end of the day. I begin with washing my face with a gentle cleanser, lightly exfoliating with a facial cloth and then applying the balm. I am a firm believer in double cleansing and I prefer to end with this product as it targets the stubborn, leftover makeup, dirt and debris. Additionally, it helps replenish moisture to the skin after the initial cleanse. I love that a fragrance free option is available to those with sensitive skin. Although I personally don’t have adverse reactions to fragrances, I prefer a product that is formulated without unnecessary additives. In short, my skin is feeling clean, hydrated and smooth. I would certainly recommend this product!"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,DEF RECOMMEND!,"I LOVE IT SO MUCH! It takes off ALL of your makeup, and after washing it off, it leaves your skin super smooth and soft! I personally like to double cleanse and follow up with a water-based cleanser, but I can definitely see how those with dry-er skin would not even need to do so!! I’ve repurchased and will most definitely do so in the future."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,AMAZING GAME CHANGER ADORE IT!!!!!,"THIS STUFF IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST! I have been a rigid Lush user for almost a decade and I have used their cleansing balms like Ultrabland, Tea Totaler and so on and honestly they don’t even compare! This stuff melt almost into a coconut oil consistently, but more buttery. It is so silky smooth and melts everything away with ease, even rough mascara or eyeliner. It also leaves your face feeling hydrated without suffocated and super baby smooth. I like to use a domain for sudsey cleanser afterwards because i have acne prone skin and like a really deep clean, and the YTTP Superfood cleanser works great after this!!! Together your face feels like a cloud. I am obsessed and can’t recommend it enough!!!!"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Forever Holy Grail,I will never not buy this. Amazing amazing amazing!!
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Amazing!,"I LOVE this stuff! It works so well, you need very little, and it leaves your skin with a nourished feel. It doesn't cause breakouts, or any sensitivity on my highly reactive skin."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"I didn’t expect much as this was my first time using a cleansing balm, but this took off all of my makeup and left my skin feeling clean and soft."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,"Hmm, my new fave balm?","Literally bought this a couple of days ago, used it the same night and instantly fell in love!!!!! I can’t wait to keep using it! I just wish that the container had some kind of “storage” addition for the little spatula that it comes with. But other than that, I like it so far!"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Great but weird smell,It works great but I was only able to use it 2 times due to the smell it has. I don’t know how to explain it but when you rub it in your hands it has this chemical plastic smell.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,highly recommend!,"best cleaning balm i have tried so far!! will definitely be repurchasing

did not break out my sensitive and acne prone skin, dies not dry out my skin either. pleasant smell. I use it as the first part of my double cleanse at night and it improved my acne too!"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,I decided to give this a try and I’m so glad I did. This takes all my makeup off and leaves my skin nice and soft. Love it! Not too thick or greasy.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,ehhhh,"it’s not awful, but it’s not the best, tried this one compared to my fav (drunk elephant cleansing balm) and this one felt very artificial and always left a film on my face. i cant tell if it broke me out of if it was underlying factors but i feel like ever since i started using it earlier this year i have been having a little more texture on my skin. beware of the film it leaves, that’s really the downside in my opinion. otherwise it is a good basic cleansing balm."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,I have sensitive skin and this takes all my makeup off and leaves my skin soft after. I will definitely buy this again. I was using makeup towels but this is so much better and I feel like it’s less harsh.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,"Love the green packaging, but didn’t quite work","I picked up the smallest jar available when it first came out, in hopes that it would work just as great as their Green Clean. Unfortunately, like some other reviews have stated, it left that odd oily layer to my face no matter how much I rinsed off.

I do love the packaging, but it was back to purchasing Green Clean."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Highly Recommend,By far the BEST makeup remover I have ever used. Not only does it remove all of my makeup (even waterproof) but it also leaves my skin feeling soft.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"this product is amazing for sensitive skin! my skin was dry from using makeup wipes for a while, but using this has helped my skin a LOT. would definitely buy again."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Perfect product for sensitive skin!,"So mind you I’ve only used it once so far, but that one time it worked wonders! When I was in the store I was debating getting the Clinique cleansing balm, but as someone on a lower budget and with super sensitive skin, I was hesitant and asked an associate what they thought. They said that their personal favorite was this one, and that it’s fragrance free which would work best for super sensitive skin, plus it was more in my price range long term. So, I purchased it and tried it out. I LOVED how smoothly it went on and just cleared away any sign of makeup, without any vigorous rubbing or anything like that. It was gentle, effective and he was right- no reaction to it whatsoever, so it worked perfectly for my sensitive skin. Definitely would recommend based off my trial usage of it."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,works as well as green clean,I used the Green clean version for many years. Had no idea I purchased this version. Feels amazing on Skin and removes makeup. I cruelly enjoy taking it off. Works just as well as green clean.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,HOLY GRAIL FOR SENSITIVE SKIN,"Amazing cleansing balm. I used their original Green Clean version previously but stopped using it because it caused a reaction with my sensitive skin because of the heavy fragrance. This has no scent and did not irritate my sensitive skin at all. Removed makeup well, better compared to the Glow Recipe cleansing balm or the Clinique."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Amazing Make-up Remover.,"Love Love love this cleansing balm. It removes all makeup even waterproof mascara. I've tested this by drying my face with a white towel and it was very perfectly clean, unlike other cleansers or wipes I've used to remove make-up, this is the best one by far. My absolute favorite!!!"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,First cleansing balm,"This is my first cleansing balm and it's great. Removes my mascara with no effort. Decided go with the one, as it's seems to be a staple to everyone. Using this will help remove my chemical sunscreen without stripping my skin"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Great and thorough cleansing balm.,Excellent cleansing balm. Easily takes all makeup including stubborn eye makeup off with ease. Makes your skin feel clean and oh so soft. I will be purchasing again.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,rinse with cold water!,Had a bit of a hard time with this cleanser at first because I was rinsing it off with warm water. Cold or lukewarm water is a must for rinse! Is as amazingly effective as the original formula. Switched to this one because i had eye sensitivity with the original formula and this one has really solved that problem. Absolutely recommend.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"I first tried the Sulwhasoo cleansing oil which irritated my skin and made me break out.  After trying this cleansing balm, I was so happy. Helped my sensitive and dry skin so much. No breakouts. I can use over my eyes with no irritation. Really does help meltaway make up. I use with their deep clean toner afterwards. My skin has never felt better. I apply it all over my face at night and splash my face with water afterwards and gently pat dry before using the toner. In the morning I apply it again and wipe it away with a washcloth to help exfoliate. My face still feels moist afterwards. Highly recommend."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,This product is so good. It the toughest things like waterproof eyeliner and mascara off. You know you’ll get all your makeup off with this. You won’t have to worry about anything being left on your face before bed. And it leaves your skin feeling so soft I love it.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,the BEST!,"Bought this a month ago and already restocking during the VIB sale! This is probably the best makeup remover I’ve used, it removes everything, is gentle, and isn’t messy. Comes with a spatula so you don’t need to put your fingers in the product."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"I love the green clean cleanser and I bought this in store on accident.  I thought I’d give it a go!  Personally, it isn’t as good.  I feel like my makeup doesn’t come off as well.  I usually don’t double cleanse but you need to with this product.  I’ve worked really hard to get my skin clear and in only a couple weeks this product has broken me out like crazy! I’m wondering if I can still return it…"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,holy grail!,"I recommend this product to everyone I know. I used to use coconut oil to remove my makeup (I KNOW) - similar consistency, but I find this balm actually helped get the eyelash glue off my eyelashes."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"ever since my favorite makeup remover was discontinued i decided to give this guy a try. first, it’s travel friendly (no need to worry about any oil spillage in your skincare bag). a little goes a long way! even though this doesn’t remove all the glue from falsies, i’m still giving it five stars because it doesn’t get messy like oils. i also like how this doesn’t have a scent!"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Fantastic cleansing balm,I really like this product for removing my makeup in the harsh cold winter months. Doesn't break me out either.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,The original is much better!,"I’ve gone through about 3 containers of the original Green Farmacy cleansing balm and wanted to try this as I suffer from dermitis and sensitive skin. I find it doesn’t work as well as my skin doesn’t feel very clean, leaves a film on your skin, and has a “clinical” type of smell."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,One of my favorite products & does its job,"This is a brilliant makeup-removing balm. A little goes a long way, and it actually removes EVERYTHING. I've tried other products like this ('Ultrabland' from Lush and the Burt's Bees cleansing balm) and they've never been able to remove all of my waterproof eye makeup. This, however, does. I use this as the first step of my nightly routine on days when I wear makeup before following up with their foaming cleanser. My skin feels soft and smooth every time."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Skip the clean and order the original,"After using the regular farmacy makup meltaway, I decided to try the clearly clean.  Ironically this one, that is supposedly more for sensitive skin, irritated my skin."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Must have!,This product was my first cleansing balm and when I finally ran out I thought about trying a new cleansing balm but I couldn’t convince myself to do it. This cleansing balm is perfect! It takes all my make up off and leaves my face feeling so clean! It doesn’t strip my skin and dry it out. It keeps it feeling soft and healthy. It is also so convenient and quick to use. I really can’t see myself trying anything else!
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,I bought this because I have been wanting to double cleanse at night to help with break outs. I have never tried the original scented one or any other cleansing balm. I personally love this product. I use it every night to remove makeup or to just make my skin feel really clean. I read other reviews about it being hard to remove and did not really find that a problem. I use a small amount of the balm and then the youth to the people kale cleanser and have had no issues! I also think double cleansing with this product has really helped my random small breakouts. I cannot use products with fragrance so this balm is perfect for me. I also have sensitive skin and this hasn't irritated me at all.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"I was so excited to try this! Unfortunately it leaves such an oily residue on the skin after washing, that I have to sometimes triple cleanse to ensure my face is completely washed. It also has broken my skin out really badly. I do not recommend this to anyone, especially those with sensitive skin."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Best for sensitive skin!,Perfect for anyone that has sensitive skin to scents. It takes all my makeup off and leaves my skin feel super soft. This will be my go to make up remover!
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,it’s okay…,I’ve been trying this out for a while now and honestly I prefer the original Green Clean as opposed to this. It really doesn’t emulsify as well and I feel like it doesn’t really clean as well. I feel like it leaves a slight film on my skin after washing it off. I am looking forward to going back to the OG.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,It could be better,"Removes foundation and skincare, but doesn’t remove mascara properly. I like that it has no scent, but it doesn’t melt as quickly as I thought it would. It’s ok, but it’s not great."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,I accidentally bought the wrong product but I’m not disappointed. It works very well for me and does what it’s supposed to.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,"It is harder to rinse off so I always follow up with a gentle cleanser. Perhaps I just need to use less. But it does take off most of my makeup. Unless I figure out the perfect amount to use, I’ll go back to Farmacy’s original cleansing balm."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Best Makeup Remover for Sensitive Skin,"I LOVE this product. I have been searching for a good makeup remover that doesn't inflame my skin (I have very, very sensitive skin); and this product is now like a holy grail product for me. A little of this goes a long way as well, so this product will last you awhile. It feels super nice on your skin and completely took off all of my makeup, including my eye makeup. I also have acne prone skin and this product did not make me get any extra pimples which is super nice. One tip: when putting it on your eyelid/lashes, keep your eyes closed the entire time. While it doesn't hurt or sting to open your eyes, your vision is super blurry and some of the balm will go into your eyes and make your vision not so great for a couple of hours."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Farmacy Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm - 50ml,So smooth with no harsh smell. Works really well with removing all of my makeup.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,confused,Just as confused as everyone else. This.. doesn’t work? I’ve tried it quite a few times and it doesn’t get any of my eye makeup off. Maybe I’m using it wrong.. but idk.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,will remove ALL your makeup,"i absolutely love this product. Using waterproof mascara has been damaging my lashes because of improper removal. So i decided to try the house brand makeup remover and struggled… this product on the other hand, is incredible at removing all my makeup, all of it. it’s also has truly no fragrance, it doesn’t burn or dry my super sensitive eyes.
you’ll definitely need to wash your face after using this product, but that’s a given when using balms.
i also love how this product doesn’t stain my cotton rounds, the makeup comes right off that too."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,too hard to wash off,"I loved the green clean. I figured I’d give this a try because it’s nonscented. Mistake. Even when you run it in your fingers, it doesn’t oil up like the green clean. After either product, I would go over it with a warm wash cloth to make sure I got the creases of nose and what not. But this feels like it’s just stuck to your face after washing it off. Don’t like it at all. Stick to green clean. I really recommend sticking to green clean"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Love,I love this product. It probably helps that I’ve never tried the original version because I hate scented items.
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,USA,Works great for makeup but hard to wash off,"It is an alright balm. I’ve been using it for a week after trying the original version at the store for the first time, and then going with the fragrance-free option due to sensitive skin. I like the size bc it will go a long way for me for a cheaper price, good for trying out. It includes a helpful spatula. I’ve experienced no adverse effects so far. It takes the makeup and mascara off pretty well, thought I do need to wash the eyes out especially after. There is residue left on the skin after using. At first I hated it, but saw that after patting my face dry I don’t feel it anymore. Thought perhaps it’s be hydrating, but saw no effects, positive or negative; I still have to moisturize after. I use it to get make-up off after work and go bare-faced at home for the rest of the evening, then use a different cleanser to get everything off and feel fresh before bed. I’ll finish this batch but likely not reorder again and try the original or something else fragrance-free."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Doesn't emulsify like the original Green Clean.,"The original Green Clean is my holy grail cleansing balm and you can imagine how much I was looking forward to a fragrance-free version. I was so disappointed that this formula was so different. 

This doesn't emulsify like Green Clean does and I NEED to use a second cleanser to get it off. The original would emulsify and I could rinse it off completely. With this, especially around my eyes, I need to scrub a lot with a second cleanser to get my makeup off and the residue from this.

If you have extremely dry skin, this may be great for you but if you are trying to get makeup off gently, you'll have to scrub way more than you should."
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,stick to the original,"I’m kicking myself for trying this version. I’ve used the original with no problems at all, but thought I’d give this version a try since I liked the idea of it being fragrance free. While it removes my makeup just as well as the original, it leaves behind a film that I then have to wash again with a second cleanser, which is something I never had to do with the original. (I know that double cleansing is a very common way to wash your face but the original worked in such a way that I only needed a swipe of micellar water for stubborn waterproof eyeliner.)"
FARMACY-Clearly Clean Makeup Meltaway Cleansing Balm,Canada,Not really worth it...,"It does take makeup off decently, but left a residue/layer that was stubborn to remove after. I usually use the Tatcha rice cleanser and I’ve never had a problem, but saw that this had such good reviews so I thought I would try it. I’ve never had problem skin before, always been lucky in that department, but this gave my skin some issues. My face is currently still recovering from a huge breakout after using this. Not super impressed. May work for some people, but I won’t be using this again unfortunately."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,part of my staples!!,"new fave! so gentle yet effective, thank you hyram!!!! the cleanser works really well to remove makeup and is quite long lasting to use twice a day as well."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,love this,"this is my favourite cleanser to travel with because it's so good for a light morning cleanse, but also great at being a second cleanse to remove all final bits of makeup and sunscreen from the day. doesn't leave your skin dry or stripped at all. it's beautiful "
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Malaysia,Hydrating cleanser,Wanted to try this as I was a fan of Hyram. Noted the higher price point for inkey list. Very hydrating cleanser. Love it for morning cleanse and second cleanser at night. 
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,New Zealand,"a basic, affordable, gel cleanser ","If you are after a basic, affordable gel cleanser this is for you. It’s not irritating but it’s also not hydrating. It simply cleanses the skin. It hasn’t wowed me but it does the job.

THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Malaysia,really suits my skin,"One of the best cleansers I’ve used so far, actually even better than the fresh soy cleanser. Fresh is too mild, whereas this leaves my skin feeling clean without stripping my skin. However when I’m having extra oily days, I’ll need to cleanse twice with this cleanser, especially at the T zone. Overall a very lovely cleanser!"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,cleanser,"this product is so foamy and soft on the skin while getting all the dirt and makeup off the face.
it is great for dry skin as it is so hydrating I LOVE IT!"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,ms ,"I  bought this cleanser at first because of all the hype. When I first used it my skin felt super clear and clean, however it irritated my skin and made it super red and my barrier took some time to recover"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,inked list face cleanser,really gentle cleanser and makes skin feel refreshed and ready for the day. the lid on bottle broke easily but small price to pay for a nice product. will buy again.
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,awesome ! ,"My face has never been clearer, I have been using this product consistently for the last 6 months and I can't look back. consistently is key and make sure you give it a good go , not the quickest results but it does it get better! and my breakouts are minimal now usually only happens around my period and then again its  not too bad and I think it has to do with this product! 
"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,The Inkey List Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,"I would have to give this four stars. Five stars for the product although at first I didn't like the scent but I got used to it pretty quick. It's not a bad scent, I just don't like it. BUT 1 star for the cap. IT BROKE THE FIRST TIME I OPENED IT LIKE WHAT? Anyways it was nice to find that other people here are having the same issue. The plastic is just very week. I get the trying to be environmentally friendly thing but, I think they can do way better."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,Good cleanser,"I love Hyram and think this is a good cleanser and does what it needs to. This is great for beginners and is nice and gentle, and also has some really great ingredients. Only downside was the lid as it was a struggle to squeeze the product out. "
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,love this,"I've got oily skin and have worked in skincare and I love this. it's so gentle and never makes me break out or feel that squeaky-clean stripped and tight feeling some products give you. I've noticed a visible change in my skin in time with using this and slowly changing skincare items over.  but everything came after this product got me kick- started again.  I had worked for a company who created their own skincare line in Australia,  only used their products for years and when I left the company no longer supported their products.  they are overpriced and aren't much better than any other skincare in reality.  so watching hyram talk about his skincare gave me the confidence to give it a go and I'm very glad I did.  just hope it never leaves sephora."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,SO GREAT but...,"I love this product, I have been using it for over a year and it has definitely contributed in a huge way to the improvement of my skin. I have combination skin, oily chin and nose, super dry forehead. This product removes the dirt, sunscreen and oil build up from the day but isn't overly stripping. My only issue with this product is the packaging! as mentioned in another review, the cap always breaks off which does lead to a loss in product for example the product must have got jostled in my bag when travelling recently because when I opened the toilet bag the cap wasnt attached and there was product all through my bag. this has happened to every single bottle I have purchased. It would be great if Hyram and Selfless could could ensure there is a more sturdy hinge."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Singapore,and,Bought this for my boyfriend because he got sensitive skin and is on the oiler side. He mentioned that the product didn’t do much and his skin didn’t have any improvement. 
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,"Cap is flimsy, not good for travel.","Cleanser is good and seems to work well but the cap is so flimsy that it broke and more than half of it spilt into my bag so now I lost 75% of my cleanser and ruined my bag. Not happy at all, this was a waste of money."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,Gentle cleanser,Great priced cleanser which is gentle on the skin
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,must have,love this product. I use it every night and I see a lot of improvement In my skin.
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,Nothing Special,The cap was broken when the product arrived. The cleanser itself is nothing special. It’s pretty standard. You would expect something amazing for the price you would pay for this but it’s very average. I find it completely identical to the Sephora Collection cleanser (the sephora one is much cheaper).
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,gentle product,"I like the product and have purchased it around 5 times, but the caps have all broken off when I'm only half way through, leading to me loosing a fair amount of cleanser in my cupboard."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Singapore,ok,This facial cleanser does ur job nicely and sufficiently. I bought this for my friend as well as to show support for Hyram. He taught me a lot in skincare. Although the price is not super cheap consider this is under Inkey list. 
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,Gentle cleanser,"I have bought this cleanser 3 times now- it is so gentle, which is important for my sensitive skin. It feels lovely to use, and when I run out of my balm cleansers, I can use this twice for a double cleanse without feeling like my skin is being stripped!"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,The Inkey List Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,"Standard cleanser, nothing out of the ordinary. The cap is a major inconvenience!"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,Miss,"Very basic cleanser, my skin broke out after using it as I don't believe it's as effective as other brands like LRP. Also the cap broke the second I opened it, I thought I was the only one but apparently this happened to a bunch of other people! "
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,New Zealand,Good for beginners,First time using a cleanser and I had no issues with sensitiveness and it cleaned well. Lasted about 3 months with twice a day use. The lid does break easily but other than that I plan to continue using.
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,good product for daily use,doesn't dry my skin out and smells very good. Will buy again
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,"Great cleanser, bad cheap packaging.","I have fell in love with this cleanser. It's super gentle on my redness-prone skin and it leaves my skin feeling fresh and squeaky clean, a perfect canvas for next steps in my skin care routine. If you are wearing makeup, definitely use micellar water or another makeup remover before using this cleanser, because this cleanser won't remove all of your makeup if used alone. 

Now the bad... the packaging. holy crap it's so cheaply made. the bottle itself is fine but the cap on this think has the most flimsy plastic I've ever seen. I ripped the cap off just by opening it after using the product once. I still love this product but yeah."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,It’s okay!,"Decent price, you really get what you pay for. Not mind blowing but also not disappointing. Good for dry skin, very gentle…and leaves skin feeling soft snd silky not tight and irritated which I’ve experienced with other cleansers. No strong scent either which I love!"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,Great cleanser,"I love this gentle cleanser. My skin feels clean without feeling stripped, and it doesn’t cause me any irritation. The only complaint is the packaging (lid) is flimsy and started to break the first time I opened the package, but the product itself is great."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,Weak Packaging,"It is a good cleanser. Minimal irritation when I scrub it on my eyes to remove makeup. Which this product does NOT say to use it for, but I like when my night routine is multi-functional. I can walk away with no toner and my skin does not feel stripped. However the three stars and my decision to not repurchase this product is for the same reason everyone else here is noting. The two little plastic attachments of the white cap have completely broken off and the product just leaks everywhere unless I stand it upright. I know this brand is eco conscious, so maybe that accounts for the weakness of the plastic. but given that the first plastic attachment broken after my 2nd use, and the 2nd one followed after 5 more uses, that this should've caught in development and it could've been redesigned. The Inkey List makes packaging for cleansers that are quite sturdy already. 

I wouldn't buy it at half price unless you don't mind being inconvenienced.  Might be a good ""in-the-shower"" moisturizer."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,pretty good! ,"The product is pretty good, nothing stand out but didn’t cause me any breakouts! Biggest downfall is the packaging, the lid broke within the first few weeks of use and made travelling with it difficult. Overall a good product, would consider buying it again"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,Packaging sucks,"The product itself is great - I like that it is a gentle cleanser and does not strip my skin, but also cleanses it well, HOWEVER the packaging is awful. The cap is really cheap plastic and broke immediately as soon as I opened it, and it feels flimsy, and the product just spills out every time I try to use it. It feels extremely cheap and low quality, which is why I rate this a 1 even though I genuinely like the product but the packaging is horrible. Will not buy again unless they design new packaging."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,Love it!,"I love the Inkey List and Hyram so i was so excited to buy this product and try it out. This cleanser does a great job at cleansing my face, does not strip or dry out the skin and works great for my combination skin. It has an earthy smell which i don't mind. I agree with the other reviews regarding the cap but that won't really stop
me from purcharsing this cleanser again."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,so underrated - give this one a try!,"As someone with sensitive skin and redness, I have tried many cleansers from Sephora. This cleanser has been by far my favourite. Light, and refreshing. Leaves my skin soft, moisturized and glowing and never irritated."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,"3/5 good cleanser, cap needs to be fixed","the cleanser itself, has a nice feeling after using it. it leaves your skin smooth and bouncy. i rate this product 3/5 because they need to fix the cap, i was reading reviews before i bought it thinking i would just be careful with the cap, but as everyone had been saying the cap was damaged before i could even open the box containing the cleanser, it’s a small dent on the inside of the cap but you expect better quality control when buying a product so highly talked of from a company like sephora. overall if they fixed the cheap cap design the product would be a 5/5 because of the quality and price of the product."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,expired or bad batch or just horrible.,Pretty sure I got sent an expired batch because the product comes out in lumps
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Malaysia,Not impressed ,"Hmmm I have high expectations on this cleanser because it’s created by Hyram. But honestly I feel kind of disappointed with the cleanser. It does it’s cleansing job and that’s all, doesn’t give a refreshing feeling after use. With this price point, there are definitely other better options out in the market. "
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,New Zealand,can include in your daily routine ,"Love this cleanser, doesn’t dry my skin too much after using. Little goes the long way in terms of the quantity! This was my 4th time buying this cleanser and I can highly recommend it."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,good gel cleanser,The Inky List Selfless By Hyram Centella and Green Rea Daily Gel Cleanser is your average nothing special gel cleanser. It is good after an initial cleanse with a makeup removal oil and does t leave skin tight and dry
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Singapore,It’s okay…,"This cleanser do get the job done but if you’re a makeup user, this might not really work well as you’d need quite a bit of product each cleanse even after removing the makeup with makeup wipes. It has a funky smell which can be off putting to many but to me it reminded me of my childhood. not really sure why. I have really sensitive skin and it does not irritate my skin much so I would say it’s a fairly okay facial wash. At this price, it is a good cleanser but you definitely can get better cleansers elsewhere."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Singapore,Just an OK cleanser,"This cleanser has gel texture which I like, however it does not amazed me in any ways, also the cap would easily broken when I just started using for a few days. I don’t think it’s worth your money as non-Hyram line in the Inkey list are much better and affordable. "
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,will repurchase,I am so happy with this product. I have really sensitive skin and this is amazing. For the quality of the product it is great value! Highly recommend everyone to give this cleanser a go!
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,"Love the product, hate the packaging","Super gentle cleanser that doesn’t dry out your skin. I’m part way through my second bottle and am still happy with it. 

My only complaint is that the packaging is super cheap. The top half of the lid has broken off both of the bottles I’ve bought. One even cracked the first time I opened it. If they could fix the packaging, I would definitely give it five stars."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,Over-hyped,"Broke me out so bad, not for sensitive skin. Took me like 5 days to get rid of the breakout this caused."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,Average ,"I think my expectations were very high for this product. I usually use the Youth To The People Green Tea Cleanser and had heard this was a good dupe. After using it for a month now, I still rather use the YTTP option. I think this would be a great product for anyone with super sensitive skin and finds the YTTP one stripping. "
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,really good product !,"i honestly really like this cleanser, it doesn’t tear out your skins natural oils ! i would definitely recommend :)"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,mediocre with bad packaging,"My lid broke when taking off the seal. I was expecting a really gentle cleanser, but my skin was a little irritated after. Probably wouldn’t buy it again but I will finish it. Will continue to see how it makes my skin feel. For reference I’ve been using the inkey list hyaluronic acid face wash and love it."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,The Inkey List Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Just got the product and the lid broke the first time I opened it. Found it extremely difficult to squeeze the product out. The tube was rock hard & I wasn’t able to get out much product to wash my face. The product itself seems ok..can’t really say as I just used it once. Would have kept it if it weren’t for the faulty packaging.
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,Horrible Packaging,Lid snapped off upon opening the product for the 1st time. Had to return it.
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Singapore,ms,"i really like the product itself. i have really dry skin and the cleanser doesn’t leave my skin feeling stripped. However, the packaging is quite fragile. the hinges on the cap snapped the moment i opened it :( other than that, love the product itself"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,New Zealand,daily gel cleanser,"this cleanser was okay but i was expecting more i think, really nice smell. quite a runny consistency though and you need quite a bit to lather up nicely! but as a daily cleanser would be fine if you just wanted something simple"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,New Zealand,Light Cleanser,This cleanser is too gentle and only best for a quick cleanse in the morning. I personally prefer a ritualistic routine where I feel like I am taking care of my skin but this feels like just a face wash you’d use on the go. Hyram said you can use it to remove make up but it doesn’t not do the job entirely like the Fenty cleanser does. You end up having to do it twice which leads to over stripping. Would recommend to try but personally it is not for me.
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,The Inkey List Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Amazing lightweight but effective cleanser! I have combo skin and my partner has dry skin with rosacea and this is gentle enough for him while being effective enough for my oily areas!
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Malaysia,its okay ,"This cleanser is just okay nothing special tbh. The cap is very fragile and the consistency of the cleanser is very runny, it tend to slip off my palm right before i even get to foam it up. The only thing that i love about this cleanser is that, it didnt give me breakouts"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Singapore,nice gentle cleanser,"it's only been two days but i quite like it. it's gentle and fragrance free and just so lovely on the skin. have to be a little careful when dispensing the product because it does flow out but other than that, no complaints.

THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,broken lid,It cleanses well but with a dry feel on my face. The lid broke on second use and was quite disappointed as it may compromise the bacteria that could get into the bottle.
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,Great Daily Cleanser,I pair this with the Inkey List Fulvic Acid Cleanser as a second cleanse and it’s perfect. After my Fulvic acid I just need something gentle and cleansing to hydrate and clean my skin. This is simple and effective and not drying whatsoever! It also has a great lather
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,Pretty average,"Pretty average, not bad, but will not repurchase. Did not feel very hydrating. Much better cleansers out there in the price range. Packaging not great."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,good for senstive skin,"doesnt irritate me at all. leaves my skins soft and moisturized. It wont dry u out. I wet my face, and my hands, I apply a small generous amount on my hands, rub the product together then wash my face for about  15 seconds and then I rinse. It removes dirt and makeup well"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,Okay not Great ,This cleanser is okay not great. I often find my skin feeling more dry after use 
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,"Good, basic cleanser in nicer packaging","Unscented good cleanser. My skin can handle fragrance and more sensor-forward skincare, so to me this definitely had The Inky List all over it. It was good but nothing special. If you need unscented, general skincare, this is for you. I now use it as a body wash because I love the ingredients and don’t want to waste it but don’t love it."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,It does what it says it does,"I really enjoyed this cleanser. The gel consistency is nice, the scent is light and pleasant, and I felt it calmed my skin while making it feel really clean. It reminded me of the fresh soy cleanser, but more affordable :) The only thing is that some of the product leaks out into the cap and gets goopy. Wasn’t a dealbreaker though, would still repurchase."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,Really great gentle cleanser,"Very gentle on the skin and works well for cleaning up impurities from the day. I will say, if you wear make up you definitely need to use a make up remover before using this, but I love how unproblematic this has been on my skin."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,The Inkey List Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Perfection in a bottle. My boyfriend won’t let me buy any other cleanser. Wont break you out and removed my makeup
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Singapore,Doesn't strip my skin,Curious to try this collaboration with Hyram. Cleanser has nice texture and 1-2 washes was enough to remove my sunscreen. 0.5 star off: the price was only better after Black Friday's sale
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,Great product - bad packaging,"I really like this product. It felt very nice and I love how gentle it is. I was very very disappointed in the packaging, however. The first time I opened it, the hinges on the cap snapped. I really hope Hyram’s line is improved when it comes to the packaging!!"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Singapore,TERRIBLE PACKAGING,the hinge on the cap and the rim of the cap connecting to the mouth of the tube BROKE within 5 days of me using this!!! what suppliers are they using to manufacture this product? The gel itself is… as good as any other product nothing amazing. Save your $32. 
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,Not a huge fan of this cleanser,"Pros: very simple gentle cleanser, no added fragrance or dyes, great for sensitive skin

Cons: lid broke within a month of use, doesn’t spread over the face very well (making me have to either use more than i should have to or leaving my fave not properly cleansed), doesn’t remove makeup well (at all)

Overall, I was not a huge fan of this cleanser and I was quite excited to use it up."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Philippines,It's much more gentler than I had imagined. ,It's really gentle but cleanses really well and my only problem is that for the price I would have gotten a more efficacious product. And that it doesn't have the same sensory experience I'm used to with cleansers. 
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,The Inkey List Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,"Love this product, feels great on the skin, reasonable price point.

The tub and lid would leak. The lid eventually broke off. 
Mild cleanser. Nothing great."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,Not bad but not amazing,"Overall a very basic cleanser, nothing bad or special about it in my opinion. Could find better cleansers for the same price or even cheaper. Have used it up but wont be repurchasing. Also the packaging needs work. I’m aware that it’s sustainable but the cap lid broke off when I opened it for only the fifth time, so had to be really careful to close it properly and just ended up pouring the product into another container. "
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,Great Formula + delivery package = meh,"Pros:
- great formula (cleans without drying out skin and gentle enough for sensitive winter scorned skin)
- smell is nice 
- gel texture lathers well
- a little goes long way (lasting a long while over half a year) 

Cons:
- the packaging, specifically the cap is beyond bad as it eventually will break off over time and use no matter how gentle you are
- requires switching the product into another bottle and pump as the cap of this tube is faulty and sharp when it breaks
- cost wise the delivery system of the cap being faulty is why I took off 2 stars otherwise this would have easily been economically perfect all around"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,Faulty packaging,The cleanser itself is great and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. The fault of this product lies in the packaging. The cap would not close properly and when I left the bottle on my bathroom shelf overnight it spilled into the lid and I ended up losing a lot of product. This was disappointing as this product was a splurge for me and I was really excited to try it. Hoping that it was just a faulty product and that nobody else had a similar experience.
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,New Zealand,don’t waste your money ,this cleanser is very basic and doesn’t do much for your skin (it made mine feel tight and stripped after using it) I wouldn’t recommend this cleanser and for the price i would expect a good quality product but the lid broke off so easily within the first couple days of me owning it by. 
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,love it,This gel cleanser leaves a fresh and clean feeling with minimal fragrance. I would definitely buy this again. Great price for a cleanser this size. Recommend

THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,The Inkey List Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,"Absolutely love the product, the cleanser is so gentle and doesn't dry my already dry skin out at all! However, I refuse to repurchase or rate this highly until they fix the cap breaking upon like first or second opening. That's ridiculous that everyone is having the same issue but they aren't addressing and fixing it."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,IN LOVE,"cause I have watched Hiram for over two years now, I  really trust his advice so I was so excited when he came out with his own skincare line. this is the first product I bought and it’s been amazing I love the way it feels on my skin and it’s great but my lip did break off when I first got it"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,Very Gentle ,"I like this product, it’s a foaming cleanser, which usually tend to be over stripping but this one is very gentle and still makes my skin feel and look clean.

"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Malaysia,Ticks All My Boxes,This gel face cleanser does everything it says it’s supposed to do! I was amazed with how good this was on my oily skin. It removes make up and is very very gentle to the skin. It does not strip you off your natural oils. I think this would by far be my most favoured face wash. You can use this on your eyes to remove waterproof mascara and eyeliner because it does not irritate your eyes one bit. It literally washes everything off your face. This should be every oily skin person’s go to face wash.
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,love this product ,"It leaves your face moisturised after you cleanse with this product not like any other product that leaves my face dry after a cleanse.

It cleans your face really well, without drying out the skin, and is gentle enough to use twice a day without drying out the skin. Has a very subtle green tea/planty smell. Gel consistently and lathers very well."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,perfect,"Cleanser is really great. Feels so gentle but truly takes off all of my makeup. I love it's natural scent. Super gentle on my super sensitive skin but also does the job super well. Effective but not stripping. Only downside was the cap snapping off straight away.
Will continue to repurchase though as I truly do love it."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,Do not be fooled by the advertising for this produ,"Read the reviews, and believe them, I unfortunately did not! Just like the reviews showed, the lid snapped off the first time I opened it. The smell of this product is absolutely disgusting, smells like rancid skin care, or clothes that have been left wet for too long. After use, my skin looked and felt oily and shiny, not clean. However, it is a gentle cleanser, with some foaming action, probably good for sensitive areas of the skin. Very disappointed in this product. Inkey List, you can do better than this!"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,ok,This cleanser was nothing special. It was a nice light cleanser and had a good smell but I did not see any different things that it did for my skin than other cheaper cleanser did.
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,New Zealand,love ,I absolutely love this cleanser!!! bought a couple months ago as am a fan of Hyram and the cleanser lives up to the expectations. I have combination skin a bit on the drier side and this product doesn't leave my face feeling stripped. It makes my skin so glowy and I love the way it feels while cleaning my face. 
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,"Packaging Sucks, but 10/10 Cleanser!","The actual product is very nice and makes your skin feel very clean and soft after use. But, the cap snapped off after the first time I used it :( The reviews with images are extremely accurate."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,great product for dry/combo skin!,"I love hyram, so I thought WOW I NEED THIS! Sadly, I have oily skin (I bought this when it first came out, I wasn’t able to read reviews or the high lights for hydrating the skin). This made my skin much more oily. I passed this onto my sister who has dry skin and she loves it!"
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Canada,Great for combo skin!,"This cleanser feels like culmination of my two favourite cleansers - the hydrating, soothing feel of the aveeno calm and restore cleanser, and the nice lather/deep cleaning benefits of the Youth To The People Green Tea/Spinach cleanser. It cleans my greasy t-zone but keeps my dry sensitive cheeks happy and hydrated in the process."
THE INKEY LIST-Selfless by Hyram Centella and Green Tea Daily Gel Cleanser,Australia,Packaging is terrible sadly,"The formula is nice and helps me remove makeup and cleanse my face but this is my second bottle and both had the cap snap off first time I used it, im not that aggressive with it so it has to be the packaging being too flimsy it also snaps off really sharp and it cut me when I broke it the second time, love hyram and his videos but pls change the packaging my hands hurt <3"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,Nice smell,Affordable. Nice smell. It doesn’t dry my skin and I don’t feel thighten after wash. I don’t see much difference on brightening effect maybe because I have fair skin tone. 
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,Cleanser,"Cleaner is gentle and love that its in a glass bottle. That said, it is also prone to breakage. "
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,I love thissss,"i used to try some products from indie lee, love them hence i gave a try to try out the brightening cleanser. it really did the job and doesn’t stripping off the moist. love this soo much. almost at my third bottle now. the smell is a faint strawberry which is not too empowering. "
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,Drying,"I really wanted to like this product. I love the packaging, the fact that it falls under the ""clean"" category and the texture of the cleanser is a really nice thick gel-like feel. It just left my skin soo thirsty and dry- so much to the point of breaking out from being so dehydrated and inflamed. I even tried switching it to just morning use while using a more gentle/hydrating cleanser at night but it still wasn't doing it for me. I ended up returning it. It's a shame because I love a pretty skincare routine but the product inside the bottle did not make the cut."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,gentle and nice,I have dehydrated skin and this doesn’t dry me out! It’s gentle yet removes makeup. The scent makes me feel like I’m in a spa.          Great purchase for its prive too!
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,Gentle cleansed,"Love love love this! Such a gentle cleanser that doesn’t leave that stripped feeling afterwards and helps with my breakout. This is already my 5th bottle, if that doesn’t tell you how much I love this, then I dont know what will!"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,FIRST TIME USER,So originally I was trying to cancel this order but I ended up saying why not right?!? Tonight was my first night and honestly I am obsessed with the smell. I love.how clean my face actually feels. The only downside was that my eye makeup didn't full come off so I know I'd have to use another product to lift it off! Overall; I am obsessed with how my skin looks ! it feels hydrated for once!
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,nice,"Honestly I excited to use this product. I like the texture because it’s gel cleanser and it smells so good like a strawberry but not too strong. But unfortunately it seems not really suitable with my dry skin. It makes my skin lil bit dry after a few times using it, but it doesn’t make my skin breakout that’s a good thing. I just keep using until it finish because the price is not joke. I’ve been using it for 3 months and still not finish yet. I think it’s really good for oily skin type."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,IT’S A PASS FOR ME,"As someone who has used a large variety of cleansers, I am honestly not super impressed with this one. I simply expected more from it, being that it’s a luxury option.

On paper, this seems like a great cleanser. The ingredients are nice, the texture is unique [think viscous jelly], the scent isn’t overwhelmingly unpleasant [reminiscent of artificial/candied strawberries - I do not really like it, but I know some others do], & it leaves my skin pretty soft. However, I find myself never wanting to reach for it. The results are just not on the level I expected them to be. I also find this cleanser to be a bit stripping/sensitizing [I have resilient, dehydrated, combination-oily skin].

The main reason I believe this isn’t my favorite, is the fact that it doesn’t combine well with other products that actually do visibly brighten my skin. When I use this cleanser, my skin is a little sensitized. To the point where I am not comfortable using other actives in the rest of my routine. Simply put, the “brightening” effect of this cleanser is too minute for it to be the only brightening product I use in that routine. Using this cleanser means I cannot follow with an exfoliating toner, or serum [ie one that contains AHA’s, or Retinoids - BHA seems to be fine, being that it tends to be more clarifying]. On nights where I would like to give my skin barrier a rest, using this cleanser would defeat that purpose. The only time I really ever reach for this cleanser, is on the rare occasion I use it for my morning routine, since I typically prefer a very gentle cleanse then.

I gave this cleanser 3 stars because if you do not use the same type of brightening products that I do, or only use them rarely, you might enjoy this cleanser more. I still honestly do not recommend it.

*Please do not ever use this cleanser for eye makeup removal. This goes triple for people with sensitive eyes. Stick to using a cleansing balm/oil first, followed by a water-based cleanser [ie one like this]."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,good and easy,It really cleans deep and exfoliate well because it breaks down the grime and doesn’t clog pores. In fact it refined pores because your skin is less clogged! It works best as a double cleanser as it cleans better after the cleaning the first layer of dirt and grimes. And u May leave on for exfoliating (after massaging over) while doing a body scrub for a good spa day in the shower.
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,one of my top 3 favorite name brand cleansers!,"This is one of my top 3 favorite name brand cleansers! I also like youth to the people. This does exactly what it says. I would definitely buy it again. I do feel like you need a few pumps though for the whole face. It doesn’t foam up which can be deceiving. I definitely make sure to wash my face for 30-60 seconds to make sure its deeply cleaning, since there is no indication in terms of suds. Great for evening skin. "
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,An everyday luxury,"Doesn't contain cocoamidropropyl betaine, which I'm allergic to. Smells like strawberries, and is gentle on the skin. This is my favorite cleanser."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,Great cleanser,Great cleanser that doesn't dry out my skin. Smells like strawberry. 
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,love ,"Has a pleasant smell to it, foams up beautifully and removes makeup with ease leaves skin smooth and cleansed ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,they have a new pump i think,indie lee should send their product to be certified etc like pai skincare and kora organics. i do agree that the smells of all their products are indeed crazy overpowering. this is the only one i like and can tolerate but other family members find it too excessive despite they are the ones ok with fragrance. perhaps if kora or pai have other cleansers that are competitive in pricing and suitability id buy them. but for now id probably buy this. thankful that for unknown reason the price has become even more competitive. 
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,Odd smell,I got this in one of those sample bags and loved it (based on the two uses of course). Would have given it 5 stars but something in it gave it a faint cat pee sort of smell. Other than the smell I honestly loved it.
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,def gettin the full size,"i use this cleanser every night and it definitely makes my skin feel so smooth after using it ! it is a really gentle cleanser so i definitely recommend this for ppl with sensitive skin. however, there r some days where i'm fine with the strawberry scent, and there r some days where i find it a lil overwhelming, so i do wish that the scent wasn't so strong. but overall the product does its job, great product !"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,Surprise ,I am surprise that this cleanser work amazingly well and gives a very fresh look when you wash your wash after using it. 
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,Brightening indeed!!! ,"This is a great buy! I use this in the morning and it really brightens my face. It does not feel drying at all. It has a very, very light citrusy smell - very smooth consistency (no granules) and lathers well. I enjoy using my Foreo Luna Mini 3 with this. I’ll get the full size soon! :) "
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,Gentle & Effective For Sensitive Skin,"I was looking for an alternative cleanser after the one which I had been using for 15 years decided to stop its production. I have very sensitive skin so most cleansers will end up drying, thus irritating my skin. Was introduced to this brand by the sales personnel & was pleasantly surprised at how very gentle it is. My skin is not tight at all after wash but soft & supple after use. Nice smelling too! Repurchased & this is my 3rd bottle...!"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,My favourite!,"My favourite cleanser out of the ones I've had! It smells so good, gently cleanses my skin, brightens my face and my dark spots fade away a lot quicker. Face feels so smooth afterwards, I love this cleanser!"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,love it!,"not drying, smells good and natural! face feels clean and hydrated, though i think it may be a bit too mild for some! if my face is oily or dirty, I'll first use a gentle daily scrub then this for the best effect!"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,3rd bottle!,"I love this cleanser so much as it gives instant brightening effecr right after cleansing. It really does cleanse your face really well but if you have dry skin, you might stay away from this! "
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,nice,"its a very good cleanser did worked with brightening much but gives a very fresh look when you wash your wash after using it 
"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,Indie Lee Brightening Cleanser - 125ml,"I have sensitive and cystic acne prone skin. I switched to this face cleanser years ago and haven’t looked back. It has a nice scent and is lightweight and effective. It can be used to remove makeup, is gentle and can be used as a mask too. I love this product and highly recommend it! It really does brighten my complexion and leaves my face soft and subtle, not shiny or irritated."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,Must Have!,Recently got a tester for this and fell in love had to buy the full bottle. Has made my skin feel so clean and blemish free while also brightening it and giving me an overall better completion!
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,best ever all in one cleanser,"I tried the sample then purchased full size since I couldn’t live without it. Make up cleanses well with just one step then very refreshing feeling. Follow up the co-q10 toner for ultimate result. Highly recommended 
"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,Great for Sensitive Eyes,Used on eye area with no irritation at all.  Smells like strawberries.  Great cleanser.
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,Indie Lee Brightening Cleanser - 125ml,One of my favorite cleansers. It gives such a nice glow!
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,good cleanser,"Gentle, great morning cleanser, smell kind of sweet not clean smelling.  This is why I gave it a 4"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,good,heard good tings abt tis cleanser.. i just wanna clear my acne scars in the long run and hope tis cleanser lives up to the hype! love the heavy packaging feels so exclusive sumhow
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,cleanser,"Love it on the first few tries. I love the smell and the texture. However i realised after sometime, my face gets a little itchy. So i stopped using. This cleanser not for me"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,Sweet strong smell,"Gives my skin a decent clean but I dislike the overpowering scent of strawberries. Nevertheless, it didn't cause my sensitive skin to react negatively. Moving on. "
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,So good!,"Decided to try it out and after the first few uses my skin was already losing its dark spots, felt a lot smoother and had less breakouts afterwards! Definitely worth getting again"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Philippines,Fave Cleanser,The consistency is gel type which is perfect for my oily skin. It has a little fragrance but so far it’s non-irritating. I use this also as a quick mask in the morning. I leave it on while toothbrushing. Surprised that the bottle is big. Will purchase again next sale.
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,One of the best clean cleansers out there,"Ive tried many ‘clean’ cleansers but this one hits the mark! my skin feels very clean, without any tightness or dryness, smells like subtle fresh strawberries, great for dry skin overall"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,enjoyable,great versatile product that smells amazing. helps to remove make up as part of double cleansing and works well as a cleanser on it's own as well
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,okay ,"This is among the first product I purchased in Sephora. Love it. But I didn't see any improvement when I use it. Probably I need more than one bottle. Overall, it does not break my skin. "
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,New Zealand,great!,bought this to trial before getting a large size. small amount goes a long way. This lasts me a week of using everyday and bought a large bottle straight away! 
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,New Zealand,love it!,"bought the tester sample size and loved it!! had to buy a large one right away. it leaves my skin feeling soft, supple and hydrated!! I also love the smell"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,Great product,"The best cleanser I have ever used. Completely removes my makeup and leaves my skin feeling refreshed, not dry or tight. Highly recommend."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,Loving it,"loving this item! my skin love the cleanser and the item smells good! although hadn't really see much effect, because I'm only at my first bottle and it's only 30ml. but definitely going back to this again!"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,"Smells great, gentle, refreshing, effective","Highly recommend this. It was on my list for awhile (based on a recommendation from multiple different people) and when I ran out of my cleanser I finally bought it. It may be my favorite face wash ever, which is really saying something. It smells kind of like jolly ranchers, very lightly. Fruity. Love it. One pump is more than enough. It’s a gel, but thicker gel and it slightly lathers. My face feels so clean after and not dry. I feel like my complexion is slightly better. It’s the only change in my skincare and even my husband said he sees a difference (which realllly says something lol considering he has zero idea I changed face cleansers). It’s very inexpensive (IMO) for the quantity (full bottle and literally one pump is quite a bit) and the fact that it’s a glass bottle. It feels very luxurious. Buy buy buy. I truly think it may be impossible to regret. Now I will say… if I wear makeup then I double cleanse and I use this second because I like the feel of my skin after. If I don’t really wear
Make up then I only use this. You could totally use this to take off your makeup but when I wear make up I want it alll off so I double cleanse to make sure."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,gentle and effective,"Yesssss! 
This scored top notes on Beautypedia and I can see why after trying it. 2 pumps, foaming between hands and gently massaging my face removes everything: light makeup, eyeliner, mascara. Once I foamed it on my face, I’ll work my luna in or just my hands. Rinse it off.

It is gentle and leaves the skin supple without any residue.

The smell was annoying at first reminding of my first strawberry chap stick in kinder garden. It grew on me and I imagine a gentle field of fresh strawberries. 

The pump is GREAT! I had 0 issue. I always close it back and pump it straight in my hands. The bottle lives in my shower.

If you were on the fence with other gel cleansers such as Fresh or Dermalogica, try this, it takes the (strawberry) cake:)

PLEASE INDIE: can we have refills on this? The bottle is just too pretty and sturdy for only one usage."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,It works but I don't like the strawberry smell,"I love Indie Lee products and this is one of the first products I tried. 
It does what it should as a cleanser, leaves your skin soft and cleansed without drying it. However it has a very sweet strawberry smell which isn't my favourite. I soon switched to the purifying face wash and I like that much more."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,Indie Lee Brightening Cleanser,"In terms of the smell, it smells good. However, the effectiveness of it being a brightening cleanser, could not see any difference at all and it might not be suitable for all skin types as my husband also tried, but not suitable for his oily, acne skin. "
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,brightening cleanser ,A repeat purchase after trying the sample size. Nice and gentle yet feels clean. Not sure about brightening effect. Feels nice on skin and has light pleasant scent. 
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,so so,I first used this cleanser back in 2019 and my first impression of it was that I was disappointed that it was so runny! But it was actually quite rich and it quickly became indispensable.
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,Repeat Buyer ,"Bought the full Size after having tried the small one. 
I like it because it smells pleasant and washing my face becomes an uplifting experience, doesn't matter if it's in the morning or night. 

Gel to foam, and even though this is a very gentle cleanser, I find that it sometimes makes my skin tight afterwards, hence only 4.5 stars. 

Worth getting on sale, definitely. Plus the bottle is glass. "
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,No Thanks,Me personally I did not like this cleanser at all! I was so excited to try this out I brought it straight out (stupid me before I knew you could get samples smh). This cleanser made my skin feel tight and sticky like 
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,awesome!,I love this brand it helps my face always looks fresh and it bright ups my face . I will surely recommended this brand to all my friends. Its worth it! 
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,Indie Lee Brightening Cleanser - 125ml,"I’ve repurchased this for the second time, I use it every morning. I find it cleansing but not stripping, I haven’t necessarily noticed a huge brightening difference, but I have been using it for a while. I also like the light, natural scent."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,Awesome Product !!!!,Indie lee brightening cleanser is so amazing 🤩!!! Definitely i will tell to the whole women out there who have a uneven tone skin to use this product its worth it! 
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,New Zealand,Love!,"Bought this thinking it would be a one-off to treat myself for my birthday but I just repurchased it! This is the first time I added vitamin C into my routine and it was a good way to ease into it, now I use a vit C serum as well. I love how soft and smooth my skin is after I take it off, especially after leaving it on for 5 minutes. I also love how natural the ingredients are. I will say that sometimes when I leave it on for 5 mins my skin goes a bit red, but it goes down over a few hours and doesn't really bother me. Only happens if I leave it on for too long for my sensitive skin. Not sure if this helped with any skin issues e.g. PIH, it isn't on your skin for that long so I'd be surprised if it did. This cleanser also doesn't strip your skin. However if you want a cleanser that really makes your skin feel bare then this might not be right for you."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,take it from a guy this rocks,This is a great cleanser . I'm a guy and I'm writing u this review . That's how good it is. It made my face feel alive again . Get it .
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,Consistently good,"I’ve been using this product for a little more than a year, and it truly is an amazing product. It spreads nicely due to it’s jelly-like texture, has a faint strawberry scent to it which is not at all overpowering, easy to wash off and leaves skin feeling fresh, clean and moisturised. Would definitely continue to repurchase this product! "
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,not the best ,I didn’t see any benefits of this cleanser other than breakouts- I would actually have to double cleanse my face with a better cleanser after using this just to get a good clean. Would not buy again 
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,Meh,"Barely did anything for me, unfortunately. It neither brightened nor cleansed my face well. Saw the reviews & thought I’d give this a try to help with my complexion but all I got was congested pores. Maybe it’s not meant for my combination skin so I won’t be purchasing this again. "
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,indie lee,"First time to try this indie Lee products. My friends recommended me to use this indie Lee products. Because of oil free, paraded free and etc. Love it and highly recommended."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,Great all- round cleanser!,"Used this cleanser everyday whilst travelling. Great for using on the go, and left my skin feeling great!"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,Worth It!!!,I absolutely LOVE this cleanser! Smells amazing in my opinion and is gentle yet effective. Love that you can leave it on for a few minutes (I’ll put it on and leave while brushing my teeth) and you get the added slight exfoliation benefits. 10/10 will repurchase it’s getting low and I already miss it before it’s gone!!
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,lovely cleanser,"I looooooove the smell of this product! Cleanses nicely and leaves skin with a slightly more radiant look. I’m trying something else now as it hasn’t helped with breakouts I’m having but once I get that under control I’ll come
Back to it "
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,Gel cleanser does the job including eye makeup ,Cleanser is good in that you can use for your eyes as well and does the job with removing all make up. I just prefer an oil that emulsifies rather than a gel formulation. 
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,acidic,"It’s quite drying, wouldn’t recommend for dry skin! Not much difference as well after usage. However I used it for awhile only as it wasn’t for me! Maybe it will work for other skin types! 
"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,Mrs ,Love indie lee products my first time using them but had no bad break outs ever so gently on my face love it I’m so pleasantly surprised wish I got bigger size those are too small 
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,My number 1,"This is my general default cleanser, morning and night. It’s not as “harsh” as the super food Youth to the People cleanser, which is my other go-to when my face feels a bit dirtier."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,break-outs and had to double cleanse,"I have combination - normal to dry skin. This cleanser doesn't work on my skin. I don't normally have breakouts but after using this product, my skin feels oily, particularly my forehead. Had to double cleanse. Pores are beginning to visibly appear larger than usual. Definitely not going to repurchase.

The sticky residue makes it harder to pump the gel cleanser. "
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,bad reaction,"This product, while I thought it worked well, despite the bad smell, broke me out so bad. I never have acne but now I’m covered. If you have dry skin or sensitive skin, stay away."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,smells wonderful ,"love the smell, feels very fresh but not sure if its brightening at all. don't mind the gel texture definitely good for oily skin just not brightening for me. "
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Philippines,5 out of 5,I have nothing but good things to say about this cleanser. First time to use it was when I got it as a reward a few months ago and was really skeptical at first since I rarely switch cleansers but this one really works. Made my skin feel soft and good. Smells really good too which is a bonus. I’m excites to try more products from this brand.
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,Perfect skin cleanser,This cleanser was way better than I ever expected!  Great facial benefits!
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,Great cleanser,"Great product and perfect size for travel. Good cleanser that doesn’t dry out my skin, leaves my skin glowing in combination with the indie Lee coQ10 toner"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,finally found my holy grail,"This is the cleanser I’ve been looking for…. It’s amazing. I’ll never use another. Removes makeup, leaves your skin bright fresh and so soft. The scent is the most lovely thing"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,Love!,"Love this cleanser. Really helped in clearing up my skin along with other products. Not super hydrating if you have very dry skin, but enough for my combo skin."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,My holy grail,"I’m on my third bottle and there hasn’t been another cleanser that has replaced it since. Texture of the cleanser is silky, the natural scent of strawberries makes me look forward to cleansing, does a great job in cleansing my skin but not stripping it, skin feels balanced and supple after wash. It’s been a required product in my skincare routine by keeping things short and simple but effective. Overall, doing wonders for my combination, sensitive, slightly acne prone, 25 year old skin."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Singapore,average ,"first time trying this brand. the cleanser is average, no offensive fragrance. able to use it daily but no obvious brightening effect (probably need to use long term)"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,Cleanser and scent? Amazing. Pump? Goodbye.,"I love this cleanser and I love the scent, but the pump is driving me nuts. It keeps getting clogged and I forget to check so when I press the pump it goes shooting in all directions all over me and my bathroom. I've probably wasted almost 1 pump every time I use it because of that."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,great,I bought the small size to try if it suit my skin and it definitely is. And have a great scent to it. It doesn’t really suit my skin type because it is a gel base and I have a combination to dry skin. But it does clean
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,Classic,LOVE this cleanser. Everything from the bottle to the texture of the cleanser itself + its smell is amazing. Cleanses without stripping the skin. Highly recommend
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,pretty good ,"I have a hard time with cleansers, some of them make me break out. But this one (despite having a strong smell) didn’t do that which I was impressed with, the smell is absolutely amazing and will probably repurchase in the future"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,New Zealand,strawberries!,"very nice daily cleanser, am using this alongside hyrams selfless and they pair amazingly for my skin!! would definitely consider purchasing again they another retailer, Sephora customer ""support"" is terrible x"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,worth it!!!!!,"Leaves my skin feeling clean, bright, and even toned. I also use it as a mask every once in a while. The bottles pump does clog easily so you have to always check that first."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,Nice smell,I love the texture. It is like a pudding texture. Can nake it as a mask before cleansing. The smell is very mild. I don't like products with too strong fragrance. This one is just nice. The skin feel cleaner without drying. Just perfect for me. The only thing that i dislike is the bottle. It is a glass bottle and can be difficult to emptied the bottle. 
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,It’s okay,I use this as my first cleanse in the morning and second cleanse at night. I have normal skin and it doesn’t dry me out. A little goes a long way but I must say I HATE the smell and the dispenser does get clogged.
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,Indie Lee Brightening Cleanser - 125ml,I love this product. I have very dry acne prone skin and this doesn't cause me any irritation.
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,USA,Indie Lee Brightening Cleanser - 125ml,So gentle and smells delicious. My skin is significantly brighter since switching to this product.
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,LOVE ,"This is one of my favourite cleansers I own.

INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,LOVE,"I’ve been using this consistently...every day twice a day since June. I am almost done with it which by the way, is the fastest I’ve ever come close to using up a cleanser!"
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,absolute love,I always like to try different cleanser and this one is my favourite so far!! it has a strawberry smell which hasn't bothered me and cleanse my skin just perfect..
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Australia,Ms,"The smell of this is amazing & feels so fresh. I also have the travel size and swear by them 👄❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💕❣️💞💛💛❤️‍🔥 but I hate having to do a 150 character review to get my points.

INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,A good trial size before committing,"Bought the trial size, since I was testing cleansers. The scent is good, reminds me of orange lolly. It's in  gel form, but it lathers good. It didn't make my skin dry, it gave a good cleanse. Moisturise is a must. Was it brightening? I can't see the effect much with small pack. Maybe you need to commit to the big packaging, then you'll see effect."
INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Malaysia,ms,I really like this cleanser that cleanse my large pores and the smell was so good!!! Its really give you the feels of clean skin and i dont feel tight at all. Just love it so much! Btw my skin is combination :)

INDIE LEE-Brightening Cleanser,Philippines,Gentle but effective,perfect for days where your pores are a bit too clogged and need some extra love and care!! The jelly texture feels great and it does a good job of cleaning my skin without leaving it to dry and stripped. I don't mind fragrance in my products as well and this one smells great like strawberries. You get a lot of product as well and it will last long since you only need 1-2 pumps!

INNISFREE-Green Tea Hydration Duo,Australia,Like it so far,Only been using it a week so can’t comment on what it has done for my skin but I like the serum it’s a nice consistency and size for the price.

This small bottle doesn't come with a dropper or pump though, which made it hard to get the last of it out - probably lying my only real complaint. The face wash is nice too, foams up well but still feels creamy, and a little goes a long way! Both products are quite heavily fragranced - nice smelling, but may not appeal to everyone. A great value pack."
INNISFREE-Green Tea Hydration Duo,Australia,skincare products,"Innisfree green tea face wash has always been my favourite.

INNISFREE-Green Tea Hydration Duo,Australia,not good for sensitive skin,"I have been using this duo for about a month now. The serum is okay, goes on nice but leaves a bit of a sticky residue. The foam cleanser broke me out badly. My skin is red and irritated, I’m getting a lot of pimples which I don’t usually do. The texture of my skin is also a lot bumpier. I thought it’s just a purge, but now I know my skin can’t handle the fragrance in it. Be cautious if you have sensitive skin.
"

ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,Singapore,Estée Lauder perfect clean multi action foam cleanser,"If it were possible I would put 6 stars! The perfect cleansing foam and mask rolled into one. Foam Cleanser (for normal and combination skin) has been in my bathroom for several years now and appears there again and again as if by magic! The thumbnail size is quite a decent 30 ml and the consumption is so economical that I never had to buy the full version. The foam initially has a very thick consistency and is squeezed out in a neat, dense column. This is convenient because it allows you to accurately dose the required amount and not waste an expensive product in vain. The fragrance is cosmetic, gentle and unobtrusive, just the way I like it. The feeling of freshness and purity is simply indescribable. No tightness or discomfort, although this foam washes the skin literally to a squeak. The pores are cleansed and become less pronounced. The skin breathes, it is velvety and fresh. I love this feeling. I don’t even apply the cream right away to let the skin breathe and enjoy these magical moments of absolute purity. The most beloved and almost perfect facial cleanser found. I don't see a replacement at this time. If the numerous minks finally run out and don’t magically reappear in my bathroom, I will definitely purchase the full version. But this foam is spent so economically that it will not be soon))) #esteelauder"

ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,Malaysia,amazing,"I did recommend this brand to my lil sis bout a few years ago. And she did like it.
It suitable with her face. And her skin looks more beautiful, more fresh, more brightening than before.
I also used it sometime as masker. My skin feel tight ( in good way ) and feel comfortable. It doesnt make weird result to my face.
Beside , i like it coz it have smooth foam and a little  grainy inside the cleanser. It also have good smell. 
Actually, i love all Estee Lauder products 😍"

ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,,Perfectly Clean Face cleanser,"A little goes a very long way, it’s not the cheapest face cleanser , but definitely value for money. Your face feels so clean afterwards, it foams when mixed with a little water on your face  and has a lovely fresh fragrance. It’s definitely one of the best I’ve tried. "
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,,Love this product ,"I have been using this cleanser for years now....it’s perfect cleanser.

ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,,Travel size,I have been using Estée Lauder’s Nutricious foaming cleanser for the longest time but I couldn’t get the travel size. I’m hoping that this one works as well. 
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,,nice,"I bought it first time this product and use it straight away .. still not sure the result because it takes time to get a result on my face but Has

The price also fair for me."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,,Love it,I purchased this for my mum who swears by this. She has been using this cleanser for years and it does a great job at cleansing the face without drying it out.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,,Pretty good product,"The only reason I did not give a higher rating is because I’m not sure if I’m suppose to use this everyday and more than once because this is also a purifying mask? So I use this every other day and it leaves a nice, fresh after wash feeling."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,,FANTASTIC,"This cleanser really does its job so well! My face feels super clean and fresh every time I'm using it. If its not because of the high price for the regular tube, I would have make this as my permanent cleanser!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,,luxury product ,"It is very luxury product. I could feel the luxury the moment i applied it on my face. It produces a nice lather and really makes the skin shiny, silky, smooth and hydrated all day long."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,,Great,Cleanse pretty well and it has a nice scent to it. Size wise this is very portable and good for trips. Will purchase this again once i finish this tube.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,,MY FAV!,"With combination, acne prone skin, this is one of the few cleansers that works for me. A small amount goes a long way! Many happy days cleansing with this bad boy... the large bottle lasted forever!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,,cleanser ,"It cleanses my skin so well, especially when my skin is super oily by the end of the day. A little bit goes a Long way. It foams up fast with just a pea size with water "
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,,Lovely,love the smell of it. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and doesn't strip of moisture. Texture was good too. enjoyed  using this. contemplating on the next order. 
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,,Still the most convenient cleanser,Still the most convenient cleanser in town. removes everything in one wash leaving the skin feeling fresh and clean. doubles up as a purifying mask too
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,,feels very clean,"Product is gel like and easily rub out much foam. It suits my combination skin, not too drying or too harsh, feels clean after one wash. A product that I will repurchase. "
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,,A must buy,I have been using the cleanser since i was in my twenties..i am in my thirties now.and the cleanser is still my #1 choice.its soft on my skin and i dnt need to buy make up remover as the cleanser removes makeup as well.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,,..,Bought only one time and cannot see much result but it doesn’t strip of my face after washing. An ok ok product.A normal face wash nothing much to say.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Foam Cleanser/Purifying Mask,,Nice,This cleanser is very comfortable to use. My skin will not fell dry after using this cleanser. I like the form cleanser. This is a nice one to choose. 
SHISEIDO-Face Cleanser,Singapore,good,I didn’t check clearly when I get this product. I thought is for ladies. Gave them to my dad and brothers and they love it! Will get again during sales 
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,"Packaging could be better, oil is good enough.","The product itself is good, not great because the oil is a bit too runny for my taste. However, the packaging could use some improvement. The oil leaks and makes the label on the bottle come off. Can you find better oil cleansers for this price though? Not sure. Better ones get a bit more pricey than this."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Yes from Me,"Now I am aware this is expensive. I let my mind go down the rabbit hole of “it’s only on my face temporarily…can I find a cheaper alternative?” I tried some other options that were cheaper (Peach & Lily oil cleanser, etc.) and didn’t have fragrance listed as an ingredient…and I began getting clogged pores and small pimples in locations I never do. For whatever reason my skin just loves this. I also appreciate the consistency of the oil. Other oils made me feel as though I was dragging my skin around. This just lets your hands glide around removing that first layer of debris from your face so you can go in with your real cleanser. My skin is very sensitive and a bit acne prone so for my specific situation, i’d rather bite the bullet and repurchase this instead of trying out cheaper alternatives only to wreak havoc on my skin. The oil just feels so nice and light on the skin too. Others felt heavier and made me question immediately whether breakouts would ensue. 10/10 from me!"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Not a Worthwhile Makeup Remover,"I bought this to use as the first step in double cleansing. I am super disappointed in the “makeup remover” function of this cleanser. I wear super light eye makeup and it does a terrible job of getting off my eye makeup. It’s a nice oil cleanser in general, but not worth it if you are looking for a makeup remover."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,Best cleanser I’ve ever used. My skin transformed into softness. God she’s expensive. But considering how long one bottle will last me I’m not mad.
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,"Amazing, Gentle, Make up Remover and Cleanser.","I've been using this for a few years now, but I haven't really appreciate it till NOW. After getting bad advice from a Derm. my skin barrier became damaged, THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT DOESN'T BURN. If you want a good make up remover this is it, but this product is saving my skin right now because it is so gentle!"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,I use this to get my makeup off at the end of the night. Does a great job of melting it off.
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Excellent Oil Cleanser,"I’ve been using this product for a long time that I actually re-bought it! Due to its oily nature, it is able to pick up any makeup I’m wearing at day or any dirt and give a good canvas for the rest of my skincare. Only downside is how much of it I have to use for my face. I would give it 4.5 stars due to that, but it works so well for my skin that that I wouldn’t want to change."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Best make up remover ever!,Fabulous make up remover and face cleanser plus it’s clean.
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Must have!,"Repurchased this 3 times now.
Gets makeup off in the most luxurious and elegant way possible. Worth the splurge!"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Decadent!,"This cleansing oil is absolutely LUXURIOUS! Most cleansing oils are “thin,” but this has a thicker feel to it and I love it! It feels like I’m bathing my skin in some sort of nectar from the gods. This cleanser also rinses easily and cleanly. The scent is very light and not at all offensive (I’m sensitive to smells). I don’t typically wear makeup, so I can’t attest to makeup removal ability. Tatcha, thank you for such a luxurious and decadent cleansing experience and please never stop making this!"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,One of my HG oil cleansers. It so rich and leaves my skin soft without a film.
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"I love this oil, it leaves my skin so so soft and supple"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Not for removing eye makeup,This 2 in 1 makeup remover doesn’t remove mascara or eyeliner. I don’t use waterproof eye makeup and I still have to use my Clarins eye makeup remover. If you barely wear makeup and want a soft oil to remove it then this is the product. It’s a complete waste for me since I always wear mascara. I’ve even tried using this twice followed by my YTP cleanser and I still have raccoon eyes
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,I don’t recommend this product for sensitive skin. This product broke me out all over this skin.
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,A great gentle oil cleanser. I have tried various Korean and Japanese brands and this one has been the best at consistently providing clean skin with no irritation. Totally worth the price tag
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Does an Amazing Job!,"Love how this oil breaks down my sunscreen and mascara so well and then turns to a milky cleanser when water is added. The smell is wonderful! I follow up in the evening with a moisturizer cleanser to take off any residue, but I probably don't need to. The only downside is the price. Wish it came in a larger bottle with refill options."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,wonderful,Usually my skin reacts poorly to oil based cleansers but this product is so gentle that it is my go to cleanser after a full face of make up. Not harsh smelling either.
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Washes it all away!,"Removes all the makeup and leaves skin soft. Especially great to use during the winter months. In summer, I follow my Camelia Oil rinse with Bosca charcoal cleanser for that squeaky clean feel."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,I use this as the first part of my double cleanse and it breaks down my makeup so easily. My skin feels so soft and clean without stripping. Great product!
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"Best makeup remover face wash!  My skin feels clean and wonderful after.  I even did the toner swipe test, there was barely a tinge of leftover makeup.  I’m curious to see how well this works at removing eye makeup.  So far I’m loving it."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,LOVE it for my sensitive skin,Very gentle to my sensitive skin. My skin was irritated by some mineral oil based products when I was younger.  But the ingredients of this product is so clean and the scent from natural herbal products calms me down as well. This is one of  the three makeup removing products I keep repurchasing.
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Thank goodness!,"I love it! After being upset about amore pacific changing the formula of their face wash, trying many then being disappointed, I found this and it's wonderful. Hope they don't mess with the formula! I use this as a first step and follow up by the Tatcha deep cleanse powder. After whining about amore pacific changing their ""perfect"" face wash, I hands down prefer this combo."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,"Good product, but not for travel","I really like this cleanser! I don’t wear a lot of makeup everyday, but it’s good enough to wash off my sunscreen. It has a nice floral scent and helps unplug pores; it really helped me with my black heads. The downside is that it’s terrible to travel with; half the bottle leaked out when I packed it in my check-in bag."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Leaves skin soft & supple. 10/10 will always love!,I’ve used this religiously for a number of years now and I won’t be without it. It is gentle and so effective at removing even waterproof makeup and mascara. It lasts a good while with daily use which makes the price reasonable and worthwhile. It makes my skin soft and supple and leaves a super clean but never tight and drying base for the rest of my routine. Couldn’t recommend highly enough for combo skin. I tell everyone about this product!
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,I hate spending money on stuff and I have repurchased this. Idk what it is but it’s amazing and my skin is always much cleaner and clearer.
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Heavenly product,"This is wonderful on my face and as a makeup remover.  It takes all of it off - waterproof eyeliner, waterproof mascara - and it does not set my rosacea off.  I highly recommend it"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"Not sure who wrote those 1 star reviews but this is the best cleansing oil I have ever used and I have used all the cleansing oil and balm on the market. I have been double cleansed before the term double cleansed was invented and when Shu Uemura was the only cleansing oil on the market and my mom had to ship to US from Hong Kong. 

I’ve strayed away from Tatcha’s cleansing oil a few times just cuz I got bored using the same thing everyday but everytime I came running back to Tatcha again and again and again.

FYI I have the most sensitive and acne prone skin one could ever have and this does not break me out and in fact I will always break out when I stopped using this. Buy this right now!"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,Love this product! It removes all my makeup with a relatively small amount of produce. I pretty much use Tatcha for my entire routine so I pair this with an exfoliator and gentle wash also!
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,Love this! Whenever I have makeup on I use this as a first cleanse to take it off! It effectively removes all of my makeup and really penetrates my skin. I have no problems with it
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,…,"Not sure what the hype is about, thought it was very regular. My skin did get a few small zits about a week into use (only change to my routine) & used a second cleanser."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,the best clean makeup remover!,This is the best makeup remover. The ingredients are clean and it’s gentle yet effective. Gently massage it into your skin and your makeup will pretty much melt off. I will say that I use an additional face cleanser afterwards but I love it as a first step to my evening routine!
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"Every time I try a Tatcha product I fall in love and this is no exception. I’m on my 3rd bottle and will probably repurchase. It’s great at removing makeup and spf without leaving your skin feeling stripped. I usually use a cleanser after but on the occasion when I haven’t, my skin is left feeling soft and clean without an oily feeling."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,USA,"soft, relaxing, soothing","I was hoping I wouldn’t like this, but unfortunately I love it. I have rosacea and very sensitive skin; most oil cleansers are irritating for me. This one is smooth, has a light scent that’s wonderful (unlike other oil cleansers I’ve used that smell like cooking oil), makes my face feel so soft, takes off my eye makeup, and overall cleanses well enough that I don’t always need to use a second cleanser. Massaging this into my face feels like such a relaxing experience. Please never change this formula!"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,There are better face washes out there!,"I bought this product a couple years ago and I used up a full bottle and enjoyed it. Now fast forward to today. I bought another bottle to try out years later.

It did not give me that clean feeling. It was very oily on my skin and I emulsified it with water into a milk wash and then I took a face cloth to wash off all my make up. I had to do that twice, to get all my makeup off and then do a second cleanse with something else.

For the price, it’s too expensive to have to use another face wash on top of this for a double cleanse. After my face was washed with this, I felt a filmy residue left behind and my face did not completely feel clean. I also experienced a few breakouts, so sadly after a few days of using, I returned. I found this much more oily then I remembered it years ago. For me, it just felt like I was putting cooking oil on my face to remove my make up and to me, that’s not a nice feeling, so I returned it. Packaging was beautiful, but I cannot justify spending so much on a product that gave me minimal results and breakouts. I have combination oily skin with dry patches and this did not hydrate my skin at all. I really wanted to love this, but it did not work out for me."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,best makeup remover,This product gets off all your makeup and leaves skin silky smooth! Also you can use it for eye makeup removal
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"Simple cream cleanser, not oil enough (at least for me) Not worth the money, just lathers your skin nicely. Does not remove anything and does not hydrate the skin, like a proper oil should! Super cheap quality with an expensive pricetag."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,JUST BUY IT!!,"I was looking for a new makeup remover since the makeup wipes I was using were not getting all my makeup off and made me break-out, but THIS, this has to be hands down one of the best products I've ever used in my life! It took all my makeup off, even eyeliner and mascara (I use the Fenty Flyliner), and my skin felt SO silky smooth afterwards!"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Worth every penny!,The only makeup remover I will ever use! One pump is enough to remove a full face of makeup! Even with a full face with lots of eye makeup- this remover works so effortlessly. My skin is sensitive so a lot of makeup removers irritate it and do a poor job of removing my makeup. This is the only product that I can use one pump and I don't have to spend so much time or effort scrubbing away. Worth the price!
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"I’ve tried many first cleanses/makeup removers, and this is my all-time favorite. I don’t generally repurchase due to the price, but if you have the money and love luxurious products, this is for you. The scent is light and pleasant, it emulsifies beautifully, and rinses completely clean. It’s good for any skin type — dry, normal, oily, etc."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Not the same formula,This used to be my favourite make up remover but I found recently the formula has changed. It's thicker and dries out my eyes and around the eye area. Sadly now I am on the hunt for a new make up remover.
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Great,This product is so good! This with the rice wash has been great!
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,ONE OF THE BEST,"I have sensitive skin and it is usually very difficult to find a product that would suit me best. This cleanser came as a blessing. I was struggling with skin issues when I decided to give this product a try based on the reviews. I am glad I did! It's on the pricier side but considering how well it suits my skin, it's worth the money. It's great at removing makeup, yet gentle on the skin without overly drying. This has been my everyday cleanser for over a year now and I plan to continue purchasing."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Best Oil Cleanser,"For years I have used the Dermalogica oil cleanser, then I tried this because I am a huge fan of Tatcha and let me assure you that this did not disappoint. It’s my new favourite. Feels like velvet on the skin, super gentle yet super effective. Removes all the makeup and debris while leaving skin feeling like silk"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,I wanted to love this more... seemed like any other simple oil cleanser. good product but nothing special
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"Bad results, Not worth the high price in my opinion"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,Great product! Doesn’t dry out my skin and even makes it soft. Doesn’t strip my skin either and takes off my makeup wonderfully. Definitely recommend
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Okay....,"Works okay, nothing special. If you want to splurge I would recommend Tata Harper, and that this is more similar to much cheaper options."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Not the best for the money,"I wanted to love this so badly. The packaging is gorgeous and the product feels really silky on the skin. I don't wear waterproof makeup, usually just mascara, and this had a hard time taking it off. I had to rub a lot and I shed more eyelashes than when I use bioderma's micellar water. Now I  remove my eye makeup first and use the oil afterwards. Disappointing for the price point but still a nice product and nice user experience."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Bury this with me when I die,"I’ve repurchased this product 6 times, can’t go without it."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,DOES NOT REMOVE MAKEUP VERY WELL,I really wanted to love this and was so excited try it however im really not understanding what all amazing reviews are about.. this didn't remove my make up very well at all and I followed the directions exactly and I dont use water proof or wear that much makeup.. just foundation concealer and mascara... no eyeliner or eye shadows... I pumped 3 pumps into my dry hands and warmed it up by rubbing my hands together first however my hands are always pretty cold.. (not sure if you need to have warm hands to make this work better or not)  then I started massaging it all over my face starting with my cheeks and forehead and finished off with my eyes and made sure I went over them numberouse times until I felt my mascara was starting to clump off my lashes and then i added warm water while still gently massaging and then rinsed off completley but I was left with tons of makeup and black mascara all around my eye area..I looked like a raccoon so I dried my face and did the process all over again.. that helped a bit but I was still left with lots of makeup residue and needed to use my normal cleanser to get the rest off.. I used this for 4 days and was trying different techniques and still came up with the same result every time.  I did like that it did not leave any sticky residue or film on my face. But honestly there are other oil cleansers out there that remove makeup way better than this one and for a better price too!
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,LOVE THIS!!!!,Love this cleanser! Im using my 3rd bottle now and will not be going back to my Fresh Soy Cleanser. I have normal to dry skin and this is gentle enough to clean the skin and leave a glow. It's amazing and love it!
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,A MUST have for any skin type!!!!,"Once I've removed it, my skin feels so soft & moisturized. Doesn't feel like I have leftover film on my face like allot of other balms & oils do. 
My skin feels like a baby's butt! 
Will definitely be repurchasing...
*My 15 yr old daughter uses it & she has sensitive acne prone skin. Really smoothes out her texture. 
Must be the ingredients in it which helps with skin texture & moisture.  
Highly, highly recommended....."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,This has COMPLETELY transformed my skin. I have dry skin in the winter but normal skin in the summer and I didn’t find I had to switch it up at all with this cleanser it makes my face feel moisturized but not oily which I also love. Will be repurchasing!
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,My New Skincare Staple,"I have been having really bad breakouts the past 8 months and switching to double cleansing with this and Farmacy Green Clean has saved my skin (for reference my skin is not very sensitive, but super acne prone). My dry spots have gone (a miracle considering I live in a cold dry climate), and my pores are looking WAY better. Also, this product has lasted me super long so the price is justifiable The mini size lasted me 3 months being used twice a day, every day.

I would for sure recommend this."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"An associate recommend this and I was a bit apprehensive due to the price, but I'm so glad I tried it. It melts makeup away and feels really luxurious on your skin and not too drying. I hate the hassle of washing my face before bed, but now I actually look forward to it."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Cleanser lives up to the hype!,"Love, love, love this cleanser! It melts away make up, even mascara and gives my skin an added moisture boost that water based cleanser alone can't do. Great ingredients and very soothing on the skin. I got the mini 50ml bottle in the Tatcha Ritual for Glowing Skin set and i ahve been using it twice daily for 2 months and I still have a little under a 1/4 of a bottle left, so I will definitely purchase the 150ml bottle when I am finished as I can imagine it will last me a good 6-8 months, so worth the price!"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,not worth it,Don’t waste your money on this oil cleanser. It doesn’t do a great job taking off makeup. I have to double cleanse with another cleanser to get everything off my face.  I won’t be purchasing again.
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"Used this product for 2 years now and I can honestly say I’m in love!! It breaks down makeup so easily, and when washing off, theres a white-ish film. I usually double cleanse after using this product to be sure I got all the makeup off, but overall this oil cleanser makes my skin feel super soft and clean!"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,it's great!,"I really like this cleanser! Since it's so expensive, I reserve it for days where I'm having eczema flareups on my face and doesn't aggravate it at all. The oil is very soft and silky and doesn't leave my skin feeing tight. It has kind of a weird smell though? Not bad, but kind of... earthy maybe? It does feel very luxurious to use but there are definitely other cleansing oils that can do a similar job at a more affordable price."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Thank You Tatcha,"Great product for dry aging skin. I’ve always loved the sun, this product has kept my skin from drying out, it removes makeup without rubbing hard, and my skin feels clean and oil free. Wonderful light scent. I live in a town with treated water, so the salt used in the water softener is hard on skin, (washing laundry I even notice how the fabric ages faster with this treated water, and I won’t start on what this water does to my hair!)Tatcha products seem to be improving the condition of my skin. No more sun spots, less wrinkles and smaller pores."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,good for sensitive skin,"I love the smell, it’s like being at a spa. The oil is a nice consistency, I rub it in gently with my fingers to remove all my makeup and it comes off with water without leaving any residue. Minus one star because it’s expensive for a makeup removing product."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,I use the Deep cleanse as my daily cleanser and the Pure One Step Camellia Oil cleanser as a makeup remover and it takes everything off and leaves my face feeling soft and clean
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"Just started using this cleanser to help clear my pores and acne. I have found it to be very hydrating and works well to take my makeup off and leave my skin super soft. I follow up with the Laroche-Posay cleanser. Still trying to figure out a routine that works for me, but so far this product has been the best oil I have tried!"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Read this!!!,"Okay soooo... this may be long, buckle up. I have dry, acne prone skin, which also reacts so badly with a lot of different ingredients. 95% of my face products are “clean”, and I have spent countless hours attempting to perfect my
skincare routine in the hopes it helps stifle my acne. I started using this cleanser a few years ago, and have bought probably 4 bottles of it since. I found that a lot of harsh cleansers and cleansers that claimed to help my sensitive acne-prone skin would actually give me painful acne (think, cystic) so I tried not to use a typical cleanser at all. Cue this! I use it every night to take my makeup off and cleanse my skin (I also use the eradikate sulfur foaming wash, as its one of few that doesn’t irritate my skin as well), and I love it. I use it for 60+ seconds, gently working it against my skin. After some time, I feel my oil plugs release (tiny, grainy things on my fingers that are plugging my pores) and by the time I wash it off (emulsifies! wonderful!) it leaves my skin baby soft and ready for my next step. It’s worth noting that if I gently rub long enough, it shucks off my dead skin gently and my dry patches near my chin disappear. I hope everyone double-cleanses, and I hope they use this. It’s a wonder, honestly. But the trick is to use it for a minute or longer, and gently! Plus cleanse again after! I also sometimes use it in the morning if my skin has any dry patches, as it lifts those up and my makeup sits 100x better. Holy grail, I will never give this up. Good luck xx"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Great Makeup Remover for Contact Lens Wearers,This is a really great product. Remouves all my makeup with just one or two pumps so the product goes a long way. It took me a little over a year to use up the first bottle and it's now my second time purchasing this product. Great for sensitive skin and contact lens wearers as I rub it all over my eyes with no irritation or cloudiness to my vision.
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,amazing quality,Removes my makeup flawlessly and helps my skin texture. It’s a huge bottle and there is a lot of product. It is great for a double cleanse skincare routine. I will always repurchase this
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,The bombbbb!!!,"This stuff takes my makeup off and leaves me skin silky smooth and soft! It's a repurchase item for sure. It's the perfect consistency- not too thick or thin, and when it hits water it becomes milky and washes right off, no fuss."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"I absolutely love this cleansing oil. I use it after a first cleanse with my bioderma sensibio micellar water. Il love how my skin feels after using it. It feels clean but not tight and still hydrated. I feel it really removes my makeup well. I try to use fragrance free or minimally fragranced products. This has a smell but it's not overpowering and it's my guilty pleasure. I love the smell and love using this product. It is expansive but the bottle is substancial, well packaged and I feel it will last a good amount of time."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Gets the job done,"This is a very good oil cleanser! It’s gentle yet effective at removing makeup so I would consider this a safe buy for anyone with sensitive skin. It also doesn’t make you feel heavy and oily once you wash it off so if you have oily skin like me, don’t be alarmed! I just ordered my second bottle as my current one is running low after almost 2 years- if you only use this to remove makeup and you don’t wear makeup often you will get a LOT of life out of this bottle"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"Absolutely obsessed with this cleanser, gets all the make up off and it makes your skin feel silky smooth. I had super dehydrated skin and this has helped so much."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,okay,"It does the job but nothing really special for its price, wouldn’t repurchase."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"Love this oil cleanser! I have oily skin and I don't even want to double cleanse after this! it made my skin so soft and the makeup melted tight away! I highly recommend this product, you won't want any other oil cleanser after this."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Returning,"I had high hopes given the great reviews however, it doesn't even come close to my staple, L'Occitane oil cleanser (unfortunately was sold out). It stung my eyes, didn't fully remove my eye makeup, and my skin feels tight - not good."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"it's a good cleanser. it cleansed my skin without drying it out. The only reason I stopped using it is because I found another cleanser that I prefer, for cheaper (Biossance squalane cleansing oil)."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"This is the first cleansing oil I have used so I wasn't sure what to expect. It works wonders for removing makeup, including mascara. I just purchased a second bottle first one nearly empty. I used the cleanser twice a day and usually 2 pumps each time, lasted me over 2 months which I feel like is pretty good mileage.

The oil is gentle, didn't break me out. Face feels so soft afterwards."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"THE BEAT CLEANSER I HAVE EVER USED 
I have oily combo skin, this cleanser leaves my skin glowing, soft and clean"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"My first oil cleanser. I only use mascara, but I’m sure is a great product for those who use more makeup :) It feels soft when applying and skin smooth when rinsing <3"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Effective yet gentle,New favorite cleanser. So gentle and effectively removes my makeup! I do find I still have to go in with eye makeup remover after or before but otherwise I love this. I have sensitive dry skin and I didn't break out from this.
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Holy Grail Cleanser,"I first bought this in a set, and now I’m on my second full sized bottle. My skin has cleared up so much. This product is expensive, but worth it. I tried to switch over to the purity by philosophy cleanser because it was cheaper and had a terrible break out. Never again! The ingredients are so simplistic and don’t contain micro plastics like cleansing balms do. I feel like it does a good job of removing and emulsifying what ever I’m wearing at the time. I use it day and night and I’ve gone through one bottle in about six months."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"I use this as the first step in my double cleansing routine. It melts off most of my waterproof eye makeup, but I still need a gel cleanser to finish it off. I have used it solo when wearing light makeup and it worked great. Was not drying and my skin felt clean and balanced."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,Meh!! Not worth it!. I much prefer my Origins oil cleanser over this one.
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Love this Cleaner,Doesn’t leave your skin oily and does clean skin and remove makeup! This is part of my morning and evening beauty routine!
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,My favourite cleanser (as someone with oily skin),"I love this cleanser so much! I think i've purchased it about 3 times now and it has reduced my oil production so much! i have incredibly oily skin and i use this product once a day in the morning! i love using it in the morning because it removes any residue make up or crust around my eyes (i know, gross lol) but I feel so moisturized and plump. I think it is very expensive but so worth it."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,it's a no from me dawg,"I should have read the ingredients list. Several horrible pore clogging ingredients, such as fatty alcohols. Left me with a chin full of blackheads. This is not for acne prone skin at all. Returned it, so glad Sephora has a good return policy. I wanted to love it, the packaging is so pretty. But the product is a complete fail for me."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,So in love with this cleanser!! It’s super nourishing for my dry skin and removes eye makeup better then anything else i’ve tried!
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,look no further,"I’ve been struggling to try and find my perfect skin routine for the LONGEST time, I’ve bounced around between a million cleansers and I’m telling you look no further. This cleanser will take ALL your makeup off, down to the last bit of mascara (no ugly raccoon eyes when you wake up from the left over mascara residue left on your lashes) and also leaves your skin soft and smooth without feeling heavy, oily or worst of all stripped and dry afterwards"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,I’m so amazed with this product! Works so well. And the packaging is super cute too.
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,Really love this for breaking down my makeup. I follow up with the Tatcha Exfoliating Cleanser and everything comes right off (even waterproof mascara) I’ve tried other cleansing oils from both drug stores and Sephora but they don’t compare to this one.
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"Absolutely fantastic. Skin feels amazing afterwards. The only con I observed was that I did have to couple with eye makeup remover. Otherwise, this product does as described."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,must try!,"This is an expensive product, so I was hesitant to try it. However it works wonders!!! I apply it first on my skin and you can see the makeup just melt off. Then add a bit of water and it suds up a little. Makes your skin feel amazing afterwards. Just one pump does the trick!"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Winter Skin Saver,"A winter life saver!  Leaves your skin soft and hydrated, clean and fresh. Sent to me with a broken pump, outside of that truly liked the product."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,So gentle,"I initially got this as part of a sample set.  I wasn't sure if I'd like it.  I've tried oil cleansers in the past, and haven't been super impressed.  I've generally found that they are okay, but nothing really worth spending my money on.
This cleanser completely changed my mind.  A little goes a long way, and it is so gentle on my skin.  After a week of use, my skin feels amazing!  I took the plunge and bought the full-sized version."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,Good product. It removes make-up well and leaves my skin soft and hydrated.
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,"This is such a good makeup remover! It really does get off all the makeup on my face, including the waterproof eye makeup I use.   I'm the type of person who shaowers at night, so when I take off my makeup right before my shower, this is the product I reach for. Even though it's an oil, it comes off really well in the shower after I've rubbed it all over my face. And I don't even need a facecloth either."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Perfect First Step In Skincare Routine,"If you wear a lot of makeup, like I do, you should be DOUBLE cleansing. This oil is the perfect first step to really break up all the makeup. Then rinse it off and go in with a cleanser to really make sure the pores are clean. It feels super luxurious on the skin, I love it!"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,DEFINITELY WORTH THE COST!!!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Incredible, I used a sample this past October or November (can't remember which month it was) and just bought it full package this past Friday and used it yesterday evening cause I was wearing makeup and I absolutely love it, it's so gentle and light, doesn't scratch my face when wiping it off or cause any too roughness when removing makeup. Definitely worth the price of it even though it's expensive but WORTH the price completely!! Removes makeup so well and totally give it an A+ note !! :) Also not to mention it gets ALL the mascara off, and doesnt leave any residue left on the lower lash like other makeup removers would for me. This one doesn't! Amazing!"
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,This cleanser is magic,"This cleanser has changed my skincare routine. I have oily skin and wear a ton of long wear makeup. two pumps and it dissolves it all, and my skin is so soft and not oily... magic. now I cant live without this product. life changing."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,perfect for sensitive skin,"Best cleansing oil I’ve tried so far, I bought a travel size when it came in a pack and it’s lasted me over two months. Just two pumps and it removes all traces of dirt and makeup -heavy stuff too. The pump is measured for the right amount so you’re never wasting product. My skin is sensitive (acne, eczema, etc.) and my eyes are even more sensitive, however this cleanser is so gentle and leaves no residue behind -even in the eyes with eye makeup! I’d recommend and probably buy this again unless I find a cheaper option."
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Tatcha The Camellia Cleansing Oil - 150ml,Love this cleanser. I use it for cleansing and make up remover. Very gentle and doesnt irritate your eyes. Makes your skin feel super soft and smooth.
TATCHA-The Camellia Cleansing Oil,Canada,Can’t help but love it,"I didn’t want to love this because of the hefty price tag, but I truly love it. It’s not heavy but quite silky when going on the skin and it rinses off so clean but does not leave my skin dry. I use this alone as my cleansing step and I would recommend 100%."
INNISFREE-Bija Trouble Facial Foam,Singapore,Its was ok,Bought for my hubs coz he has oily skin. But its no difference. No change as per normal.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Sea of Pimples,I tried to start incorporating double cleansing into my skincare routine and this destroyed my face. At first it left my skin feeling supple and hydrated but over the course of a week I began to break out heavily on my forehead (not an acne prone person). I guess my face just doesn't like oils. Micellar Water works way better as my step 1 to double cleansing.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,"a bit oily, but good","it leaves oily residue on the face after rinsing it with water, but I dont mind since it remove all my makeup and I am going to come with a second cleanser anyway.."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Australia,cleanser,All I can say is wonderful! I have dehydrated skin but also combination. This is perfect to pop into your bag to use as a refresher on top on makeup but also as a spray after Toning the face. The scent is nice and makes a difference with the pores too. Works great in hand with Dr.murad facial cleanser.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Australia,worth a try,"Gave this a go following recommendation from sales person and I think it works well in a double cleansing routine. It did take my makeup off although I don't use heavy eye makeup. It didn't make my skin react and I have sensitive combination skin, I actually found it refreshing. Will buy it again."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Australia,Like,"It took me a while to get used to the smell but then I love it. Does the job in removing makeup, but you do need quite a few pumps for the whole face so I find it finishes really quickly and considering the price, it is quite expensive."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Canada,A Very Good Porduct,I have been using this product for couple months. It was a very good product. It cleaned my eyeliners efficiently yet the cleansing oil didn't irritate my eyes nor my eyelids. I am very happy with the purchase. I would recommend this product.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,The only cleansing oil I repurchase!,I love this cleansing oil as a first cleanse! Have been using it this way for years. It feels great on the skin and it doesn't irritate my skin even if I leave it on a bit too long. The bottle looks small but it lasts forever if you use it as directed (3 pumps for the entire face)
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Australia,gentle cleanser ,Feels nice on the skin. I have found it works well on waterproof mascara using a moistened cotton pad. I gave previously used micellar water as a makeup remover and I think this is much kinder to the skin as it leaves it feeling hydrated.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Taiwan,Shelly,非常平價的卸妝油，且不會悶痘，也不會有油耗味，非常推薦購買。
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,quite good,"I have this issue of eye liner, kohl smudging to my skin around eyes and making my undereyes look even darker. And even after cleansing using micellar water, other oil based cleanser, I found some product still stayed and kept leaching to my undereyes the next day. This oil cleanser has solved that issue for me, as it is gentle on my eyes and takes away everything in one shot. Very happy with it."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,"So clean, so not-tight after wash",Amazed by how well this oil cleanser removes my waterproof makeup without leaving my skin tight. My skin feels great after every wash.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,GOOD cleanser!,"Even though I have oily skin, I love an oil cleanser as a first step in makeup removal. I have been using this cleanser for a little bit and I like it pretty decently. For the price, it is great! It removes makeup well, leaves the skin feeling soft and not stripped, and it just feels very luxurious. The only negative things I have to say, and which is why I gave it 4 stars, is that it is fragranced and the spread of the oil isn't enough. The fragrance is not terrible, it kind of smells like strawberry poptarts in all honesty, but the texture of it means that it needs at least two pumps to truly get to all the makeup. It is oddly too thick. I will more than likely rebuy this however!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Australia,Nice feel but...,"This is great for removing all make-up except mascara. You will need more than a pump as stated in the usage but it will remove foundation, eyeshadow, lip makeup BUT mascara just gets smudged and partially removed. It does feel really nice on the skin and after rinsing skin is left soft not dry and uncomfortable. Will purchase again more for daily cleansing than make-up removal."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,is not what I thought ,"I dont know if I use the wrong way or something is wrong , its really hard to use this to remove my make up, and cant use use cotton pad with it , I am so confused with this product"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Added to Routine,"It's no Shu Uemura but it cleanses well and doesn't burn my pockets (and my whole pair of pants frankly). The sweet almond smell is also comforting. Only downside is that it's viscous so just rmb to warm it up with your palms a little more so it doesn't tug at your skin.

Oh also it doesn't sting my eyes, which is super."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Australia,perfect before cleansing,I’m really into double cleansing and the Caudalie cleansing oil really breakdowns all the sunscreen and makeup and does not leave my face really oily which I really love and my face feels very clean after I follow up with the Caudalie salicylic gel cleanser.

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Best Makeup Remover EVER!,"I just adore this cleanser. I bought it and used it almost everyday for about ten months, so it does last. And it takes my makeup off entirely, like seriously! I double cleanse and after I use this makeup remover there is literally no makeup left ever. In addition, it’s very gentle on the eyes. I have issues with makeup removers stinging my eyes, but this one never does."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Mrs,"Loveeee this so much!!! It does wonders in removing my light makeup & also sunscreen.

I never tried a cleansing oil until recently and couldn’t find one I liked until this one! Works well to melt away my make up!

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Nothing compares,"I keep coming back to this! I just finished a cleansing balm by Farmacy, and let me tell you I was dreaming of Caudalie's cleansing oil the whole time. Nothing compares to this when it comes to quick and TOTAL makeup removal. As a bonus, it also leaves my skin feeling hydrated! But most importantly I don't need globs of product. Worth it!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,The BEST,"If you have dry skin, this is the cleansing oil for you!! I’ve tried many different cleansing oils and balms and I always feel like my skin is tight and dry after using them, but not with this one!

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Caused bad breakouts,"I usually love Caudalie products. This one is terrible. I got small white pimples all over my cheeks. I don’t really breakout anymore (as I’m getting older) and never on my cheeks. Read reviews and saw others had the same problem. This was the only product I added to my skincare routine. Stopped using and within a week, skin started to clear up. Very oily, hard to wash off."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Love! No stinging my eyes and takes off all my makeup perfectly

This smells of almonds without being strong, and doesn't sting my eyes."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Canada,Good creation,"This is a well made product, super gentle and efficient. It feels like a treat as you are doing it and afterwards.  It is very calming and easy to use.  The texture is so gentle, feels therapeutic. 

The pump is poor quality but I can deal with that.  The bottle itself is very nice.   The scent is super gentle, you can barely smell it, it is a nutty clean smell.  

Yes I do recommend it, yes I will buy again."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Australia,cleansing oil ,"Really good for a first cleanse really breaks down  all the makeup and sunscreen  and dirt . will repurchase. Will try others products as well. Price bit pricey, but happy with what it does "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,"I’ve been using this for more than 4 years.

LOVE IT PLS NEVER CHANGE IT"

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Canada,Love this formula!!!,"I've possibly tried 15+ different makeup removing formulas since my young age... but nothing quite like this! Removing oils are a game changer for me, waaaayyy more efficient than liquid formulas and better for the environment too, since the only thing you need to use it is your hands. 

I've first tried this formula 7-8 years ago (in the old packaging) and loved it immediately. I love the texture, the way it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean, I love that it takes seconds for the makeup to be removed... truly, it's my favourite makeup removing formula on the market. Being honest, I've also been into the ""Biosource total renew balm-to-oil"" from Biotherm in the last couple of years, which was much more affordable than this one but it's now unfortunately discontinued... so here I went again, buying the Caudalie formula and let me tell you... I feel right back in love with it... WOW!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,This melted all of my makeup off including waterproof mascara. Will definitely repurchase.

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,"I bought this because someone mentioned this was good for melting away sunscreen. Well, maybe if you use a very lightweight sunscreen. It did absolutely nothing for water/sweat-resistant sunscreen."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,I love this oil it takes off all my makeup and doesn’t leave residue behind. Sometimes with other cleansing oils I notice on my towel there are traces of makeup left which is frustrating. I don’t worry about that problem with this oil.

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Canada,run don’t walk,"This cleansing oil is amazing! It’s so gentle and really takes everything off, makeup(even waterproof mascara), sunscreen. I am so happy I bought this. If your on the fence about buying just do it, you won’t regret!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Average ,It was little greasy and required multiple applications to get rid if eye makeup. Consistency is little thicker and leaves white residue after applying.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,So good! very gentle!,"Very good and gentle make up remover. I usually use a two phase make up remover from Lancôme and Nars, and this was quite a bright surprise. Way much more gentle to my skin. There is no strong smells as well, which is a good bonus for me. I don’t like those sweet and super good smelling skincare products."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Canada,"LOVE, HIGHLY RECOMMEND",LOVE LOVE LOVE this remover. It works like a charm and doesn't feel heavy or sticky on the face.

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Perfect for gentle makeup remover,Amazing! Super gentle for the skin without compromising deep cleanse
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Canada,get this if you double cleanse,I use this to remove makeup prior to second cleanse. Fantastic results. I also have very sensitive eyes and I felt nothing with this. Since I only use this in a double cleanse I can’t speak to it if you use it alone but I think it would work decently on its own.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,does the job well!,"a great alternative to my usual cleansing balm. i like it bc i don’t have to stick my fingers in a jar to get some product. the smell is mid, but overlook the bland smell for the nourishing properties"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Australia,Ms,"This product is perfect for my dry/combination skin. My previous makeup remover stung, but this thoroughly removes makeup and leaves my skin feel soft, fresh and moisturised. I wish it smelt a bit nicer, it just smells like chemicals but I rate the actual product highly. "

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,"On my second bottle! My facialist said I needed to start using cleansing oil, as my other pricey fancy soaps were drying my skin and making my pores huge. I tried this one, as they told me in the store it was really natural. I absolutely love it, and my skin changed dramatically. I tried another brand while traveling, and it left a oily film. I went back to this brand because my skin feels clean afterwards."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Everyone Needs an Oil,I started double cleansing to avoid acne from wearing masks all the time and this was a HUGE savior. It removed all my makeup and prevented my skin from drying out when I'd follow with a cleanser. I feel like it helped even out my skin and actually made it less oily. It's an official staple now.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,"It’s just okay. I like that it has castor oil on it, but I’ve used other oil cleansers that I’ve liked more"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Repurchased Multiple Times,"I've repurchased this product multiple times because I know it works for me as part of my double cleanse. However, I wouldn't say it's life changing- I'm sure there are cheaper products on the market that are just as effective. But I like it:) 
The one star removed is for price, but it's not too bad compared to other caudalie products and lasts a while!
I massage it into my skin, rinse, then follow up with a regular cleanser. I think of this product as more of a makeup/spf remover rather than a cleanser. I don't wear heavy face makeup often but I do use a tinted sunscreen everyday. I also wear waterproof mascara most days and will say that this product won't remove waterproof on its own- I usually add a few drops of micellar waterproof makeup remover in my hands as I'm using this one. It's totally safe to massage into the eye area as you're removing makeup! I prefer it over makeup-removing balms I have tried (drunk elephant, zero brand), but maybe it's a texture thing. Less sticky feeling?
As someone with oily, acne prone skin, non-sensitive skin, I can vouch that this product doesn't break me out (when used as part of a double cleanse) ! I'd recommend trying it out for sure!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Not bad,Ive never been a fan of cleansing oils but this does its job reasonably. doesnt hurt my sensitive eyes and easy to remove during second cleanser. will recommend this.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Australia,Good product,"Good product! Does the job, but sometimes leaves a bit of the mascara."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,could it be karma ?,"I didn’t even even get to try this out, it literally fell from my hands one time  and broke. All the product went down the drain, such a traumatic experience, will try something with better packaging next time."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Australia,No mess cleanser,"I quite like this makeup remover. I don’t have to scrub at my eyes, it removes makeup pretty easily. I haven’t found it to be too oily. It feels so much easier to use than other brands. I’d buy it again "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,"Decent product, good price, does not break me out","I will tell you this is the same thing as dermatalogica oil, but cheaper. Although the smell is strange, BUT it does the job, removes make up easily. Love it, great price/quality."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,"Cleans skin very good, smell is not overwhelming and easy to wash off."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Take it off,I use this prior to the Vinoclean face wash when I wear make-up. A few pumps and it takes my makeup right off!
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,"Removes all my foundation in one go without irritation. It's a bit tougher to use on eye makeup, it doesn't remove as much but it's still a win for my skin."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,My New Go-To,Love it! I can use this on and around my eyes to take off eye makeup and it doesn’t sting. I love that it’s a little thicker and not so watery like other cleansing oils I’ve tried. It’s the perfect first cleanse for me!
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Not bad a product ,I have ditched make up since the pandemic and mask wearing. But I wanted to get a cleanser oil to clean off residue of my serum/moisturiser/sun screen and whatever excessive oil I have for the day before my face wash. Love the consistency and the light smell of it.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Canada,My fav oil cleanser!,"I find it difficult to believe this didn't work for people. I am on my third bottle of this stuff and will continue to purchase! It removes everything -- waterproof mascara, stubborn eyeliner, sunscreen, foundation -- and doesn't irritate my skin. I have sensitive skin which is both oily and acne prone and this is an excellent oil cleanser that doesn't cause me issues. I use a double cleansing method and this is my first step. The smell is mild and faintly almondy. Remember to apply on DRY skin and rinse with water prior to applying a second cleanser!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,It has replaced Tatcha cleansing oil!,I loved how effective the Tatcha cleansing oil is at removing my makeup but it would irritate my eyes so much. I prefer to have one product for the face and eyes and this is the one! It is also less expensive than Tatcha's which is a bonus :)
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Australia,Consistent Oil Cleanser,This was the first time I’ve ever used an oil cleanser for the first clean in a double cleanse routine. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised how quickly it removed my waterproof eye makeup and how it doesn’t feel overly oily once I rinsed it off. I find you really do need to warm up the oil before tackling the waterproof mascara as sometimes it might leave a little residue. I follow it up with a different cleanser to give my face a fresh clean feeling. 
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,So embarrassing I let my friend use this to remove her makeup it didn’t at all…. She doesn’t even wear much mascara and concealer. This is water and 20% castor oil garbage in a bottle. So embarrassing Caudale remove this product immediately. Canceled permanently
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Not a Fan,"This does a mediocre job, doesn’t spread easily, does not remove mascara and did not have a pleasant smell. I would never know it had almond oil which has a nice smell. Luckily, I’m a double cleanser, so my second cleanser had more work to do. Farmacy Green Clean is so much better."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,New Zealand,great for makeup removal,"I like makeup removing oils/balms, this one is a new favourite though I've always thought they felt the same but this one definitely leaves my face less oily than others and is a lot easier to rinse off during a double cleanse, might even repurchase!! wouldn't recommend buying from Sephora but definitely recommend the product x"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Canada,my fav,"it’s really great at melting your makeup and personally, i love it. it emulsifies a tiny bit when warm water is added but not enough to wear it becomes any kind of cleanser. either removing it with a wipe or double cleansing is necessary (i recommend double cleansing as it’s better for the environment because less wipes = less waste, but also double cleansing leaves you feeling cleaner). also really nice that i don’t have to scoop a little spatula or my fingers into any kind of jar, the pump makes it easy to use and more cleanly. overall you get a lot of product for a good price, and it works."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Australia,Love it,"Great oil cleanser to take makeup off! Loving it so far as it glides a lot smoother than my regular cleansing balm. It’s got great ingredients and no scent (I actually wouldn’t mind a little fragrance as it adds to the experience, but it’s not necessary). There are so many on the market at the moment but I think I would repurchase this!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,"I have very sensitive skin around the eyes, this product is perfect to remove the make-up without irritation"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,10/10,"I use this as my first step in double cleansing. It does a wonderful job removing the sunscreen and makeup that I have worn that day. Whether it be a tinted moisturizer or a full coverage foundation, this cleansing oil takes care of it. I follow this up by using FAB Pure Skin Cleanser because, like most cleansing oils out there, it leaves a residue even if you do a good job at rinsing your face. I also appreciate that this formula doesn't irritate my eyes or have a strong fragrance."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,"Great, however...","I really like this cleansing oil. It’s straight and to the point.. Works really well. However, I’m a huge cleansing balm fan. If you like the experience of using a balm, this may not be for you."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,"Simple and straightforward. I wear a lot of eye makeup, especially eyeliner and mascara - this can clean it all off. However, this oil is thick and really should be warmed up before applying because it can take a bit more time/effort to really work it into heavy makeup areas. It does leave a residue, something I’ve never had an issue with in other products but I think it’s because the oil is thicker. Also smells kind of like play-doh when applying, but the scent does not linger. Not my favorite, but it’s still a solid makeup removing cleanser and I appreciate Caudalie’s effort to go zero waste by next year."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Good but not the best as I'd hoped,"I was so excited to try this and wanted to love it cause I like most of Caudalie's products, yet it was underwhelming. Starting off on the good notes- this is the most hydrating makeup removing oil I've used without residue (i've used Clinique, Innisfree, Sulwashoo, Dermologica, DHC etc), and won't tug on the skin. My skin feels soft even after I go in with my second cleansing step. Cons- it doesn't emulsify very well... if i'm in the shower it's fine but if I'm washing my face at the sink, then definitely takes longer to rinse everything off. Also not a great fan of the almond scent. Will continue my hunt for makeup cleansing oil after this."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,#NOTafreeproduct This used with a cotton pad does an amazing job of removing sunscreen and and tinted moisturizer I'm using. I don't wear foundation so not sure how good it would be for that.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,don’t like it,"Don’t like it, it feel like oil for kitchen, bad smell"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,I really like this cleanser for basic makeup removal but it doesn't at all work for my waterproof mascara which is what I was looking for.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Canada,Not bad,Good at removing eye make up but you’ll need to double cleanse with another product since this leave an oily residue.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,GREAT CLEANSING OIL!,"I use a few pumps of this cleansing oil at night and so far it’s done a great job at removing my makeup, including waterproof eye makeup. One of the best oils I’ve tried thus far."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,glad I purchased,"Just hit my 30s and had a child. My skin has become so dry and sensitive. This has been so nice to my skin. It breaks down make up, emulsifies well and softens my skin."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,pleasantly surprised,"I’m a double cleanser and typically use a balm as my first cleanse and wanted to switch to an oil just because it’s so much more convenient. I found that I just didn’t like the texture of the oils I’ve tried in the past as much as the balm because they are often so runny. However. This oil is quite thick, less runny and gets the job done! I do not wear any makeup most days besides mascara and brow pencil, but this does get those off as well as sunscreen off. It does not leave a residue at all, although it matters less to me as I’m always going in with my second cleanse. The scent is almond-y and quite pleasant to me (although no scent would be better, but this at least smells good). I will definitely continue to repurchase as this is pleasant to use, and the pump is much easier than dealing with a cleansing balm."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,My favorite make up removing oil that doesn’t irritate my eyes. I have pretty sensitive skin and it does t cause it to breakout. I would say it is a tiny bit drying though but I don’t mind.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,LOVE This Cleanser!,"Applying this is my favorite step of my evening skincare routine! It's so gentle on my skin and I love the smell; the whole experience is very calming. It took me about 3 months to go through a bottle (using 3 pumps once a day). I could probably get away with washing my face with this twice a day since it's so gentle, but at its current price I care more about making it last. I was also impressed with how well it removed my eye makeup. The very first time I used it, I even went over my eyes with makeup remover after, just to be sure, and my cotton pad came away clean!! Granted I only wear mascara, eyeliner, and brow gel, so I'm not sure how effective it is with shadows, etc. This is my first cleansing oil and I'm never changing!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Nice oil cleanser. This works as expected to remove makeup and especially mascara. It’s thicker than other oil cleansers I have used. Rinses off well and doesn’t leave a residue. Didn’t give me blurry eyes like some others. A good basic and clean option.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,STRONG ALMOND SCENT but good tho,"This is a great cleansing oil that does the job BUT
There wasn’t any warning about the STRONG almond scent of the product. As someone who isn’t a fan of almond it makes me wish I would’ve bought a different oil to avoid that smell"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Wanted to love this but it caused milia for both myself and my roommate. Removes makeup but leaves an almost squeaky clean feeling after rinsing with water. Very strong almond smell so be aware of that if that isn’t a smell you enjoy.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Nice cleansing oil,"The bottle was small. But very powerful. It helps to remove the dirt, make up etc. You first need to massage your skin before you clense. You will notice how clearer your skin after the application. "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,room for improvement,"It gets my makeup off and is a good size for price, but it’s not great. It smells nice! Very light scent. It’s super runny and gets EVERYWHERE, it drips down the pump and onto the bottle. It made me break out and my eyes burn, sadly. I really wanted to love this."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,Holy Grail of Oil Based Cleansers,This is the best oil based cleanser I have ever used and I have tried many.  It goes on silky and takes off all my makeup including waterproof.  Rinses clean with no residue.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,"It does the job by removing makeup minimally, however when I wash and dry my face after, a lot of makeup still goes onto my towel. I’ll probably return and go back to the Dermalogica pre cleanse as that was the best for me and really removed all makeup"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,"Effective, gentle and smells really good! Fair price point and good size."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,"Really nice but a little irritating if it gets in the eyes. I use eye drops after each use. 
It’s actually not as oily as I thought it would be. It washes off kind of milky"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,USA,BEST CLEAN MAKEUP REMOVER!,"Best “clean” makeup remover! First, I love the clean ingredients in this product. Also, The scent isn’t overpowering at all. It cleans my makeup off and leave my skin hydrated and honestly I’ve actually seen an improvement in my skin since I started using this. Highly recommend! It even works great with my oily skin."
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,didn’t work for me ,"Wouldn’t recommend this if you are prone to clog pores. Otherwise, it’s a really good makeup remover, has a nice watery texture and can remove heavy makeup easily. Sadly, oil cleansers don’t work for me… "
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,not too oily,"I’ve been using Shu Uemura cleansing oil and when there’s no stock, I ordered this to try it out. The consistency is not oily enough, very dilute feel, need to pump at least 4 times. Whereas You only need about 2 pumps from Shu. The smell is quite nice. I won’t purchase this again. "
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,nice make up remover,"Used to use Clinique balm, decide to try the oil. It did the job, also a bit easier to rinse than a balm product. The smell is light yet pleasant. I am refilling "
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,love it! ,bought this travel version to try for my overseas trip and enjoyed it. removed my make up very well and did not cause any outbreak! good for my dry sensitive skin and doesn't dry my skin out. have used this consistently for 2 weeks and will continue to use this 
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,cleansing oil ,"Love love this product !! The consistency isn’t extremely oily and it’s so easy to wash off unlike certain oil based cleaning for the face. I got this the first time to try in the smallest size and love it so much gonna get my hands on the bigger bottle 
"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,FOR OLDER DRY SKIN…,I tried this when it was out at the store 4 trying on makeup. I never would have given it a look. I used it to take off the samples I was trying on and I fell in love. I’m 55 and have dry skin now so I need moisture in all my products this is great. No smell that I remember and it’s light but very oily. It’s too expensive but until I can find a dupe I’m loving this!
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,This deserves more hype!!!,I have tried dozens of oil cleaners and this is the BEST. Years ago I got a travel size as a gift with purchase and truly so impressed. I don't understand why this product doesn't get more hype?!?!? Well... if it cost less I would buy it way more often. This is an oil cleanser that feels like it rinses off with just water and doesn't need a second face wash to get rid of residue. It removes heavy eye makeup really well without needing to heavily rub or wipe the eyes. I think this product deserves more praise like some other reviews say! I do 1-2 pumps and massage it all over my face for maybe 20 seconds and it rinses off clean and skin feels great
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,will def purchase 2nd bottle,"I use this as cleanser for makeup removal and everyday cleansing for just about a few days now and the difference is quite noticeable, my face feels more hydrated. I like that I can sleep right after cleansing, w/o worrying about clogged pores etc, as this cleanses quickly and quite well. It can also be use for removal of eye make up. Fuss free is the way to go in our busy life. "
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Bobbi Brown Soothing Cleansing Oil,"Able to remove makeup easily. Not very greasy and after cleanse, it’s not so oily. Comparable to Shu Uemura. However, price point wise, it’s lightly expensive and uses up pretty fast.
"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,good ,"Good scent .Can remove my daily make up , sunscreen very well . My skin getting better after using oil type remover . Definitely will repurchase,love it so much "
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,gentle on the skin,"This is a gentle yet effective makeup, grime and city pollution remover one can ask for. Not harsh on my sensitive skin and no funky fragrance smell at all. Decided to convert to full size after trying out the travel size. "
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Good! ,"I love it!!! It’s so surprisingly good and did no
 disappoint! 10/10 would recommend you all! It does what it say!!!! Go and get it!! Price is reasonable too! "
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Good for removing make-up,"Used this many years ago and stopped for awhile as I switched to other brands. Decided to come back to this as I like how convenient it is to remove make-up with this. However, Im started to get some bumps around my eyes. Am wondering if I did not wash this off properly."
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Bobbi Brown,This removal is comparable to Shu Uemura oil cleanser. It is not so oily as compared to Shu Uemura. It cleanses all the makeup without feeling very oily in the face: Bought the small bottle to try. Overall pretty good remover. Will consider buying the bigger bottle.
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Small,It is quite small than what I have expected... Havent try yet hope it is okay. Wanted to buy this product for a long time. Hope it wont be used up too fast 😆
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,smooth,I started using this product two years ago and I love how gentle it is on my skin. I have taken off max point black waterproof eyeliner with this without a problem. That eye liner can only be taken out by Neutrogena wipes.
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,disappointed ,it cleanses well but at the same time also makes my skin feel so dehydrated. besides the price also feel quite pricey for this volume. disappointed as i thought this should be good for me
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,worth a try!!,I am new to the BB skincare line and purchased this  on a whim over Black Friday and absolutely fell in love with this cleanser! It is very light-weight and I definitely will keep using this 
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,miss,"I have tried many brands of make up remover. This is the best cleansing oil for me, texture is light and It make my skin feel soft. There is no residue after rinse. Other than remove make up it stable my skin condition. The smell is very soothing. Had repurchase several times."
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,Best oil cleanser,Gets all the makeup off and doesn’t leave a film. Love it!
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Excellent product!,Cleansing oil which doesn't makes your skin feel oily after using. Recommend using this during the nigh time as it helps to remove make up and do cleansing at the same time. And double cleanse is not needed from my opinion. 
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,the best makeup remover in town,"This is Bobbi Brown star product for a reason. Wish I try this brand 5 years ago when I started this whole makeup journey. It completely removed my full face heavy makeup effectively without tugging and pulling the skin. Smells nice, no irritation and most importantly soft and smooth feeling after double cleansing"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,good,"Perfect cleansing oil. Good smell, smell natural, not the artificial kind of smell. And it removes makeup completely, won’t have breakout after using it too"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,So far so good,"Im a newbie at using oil as makeup remover. i usually like to used L brand Gentle Lip & Eye Makeup Remover with facial wipe. But now, i like using this BOBBI BROWN Soothing Cleansing Oil, it is like it said, more soothing to my skin."
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Ms,"Have been using DHC’s deep cleansing oil for the longest time and decided to treat myself to the Bobbi Brown. Very pleasant/floral smelling, and washes off easily. Skin is left very very smooth and velvety as compared to the DHC - even after double cleansing the effects of the oils are still felt. Expensive but I would probably buy this again over DHC next time.  "
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,Best oil cleanser,"Not sure why this isn’t more hyped! Best oil cleanser I’ve ever tried, and I’ve tried them all the high end ones."
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,Bobbi Brown Soothing Cleansing Oil - 200ml,This was my first cleansing oil I bought and I was actually very surprised! It worked really well and removed my makeup. Didn’t leave my skin feeling weird or oily afterwards.
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,AMAZING,"I have tried several other cleansing oil/makeup remover - this is by far my favourite, hands down the best make up remover. Causes no irritation to the eyes and face. Can’t speak for those with sensitive skin, but I think it should be fine. Please give it a try. "
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,love it,Love this cleansing oil so much! Really helps cleanse the makeup off quickly and with a small amount. Love how the oil turns to soap once hit with water and love the after feeling of washing face. Does not feel dry or tight. Feels soft and smooth. 
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Gorgeous oil cleanser,"Despite its lightweight texture, I was amazed by how effective it removed a full face makeup so effortlessly. Double points for its light scented that is very relaxing and soothing after a long day. Bought the 200ML, think it can last a long time. Worth the money!

"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,recommended,"This is useful. I no more double cleanse after use this. If I use shu uemura without double cleanse, i notice my pimples will come out. But if fine use this without double cleanse. Just the smell I prefer shu uemura"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Canada,don’t be afraid of oil cleanser,Love be this cleanser. It’s smooth. Leaves my face clean and not dry. I have very dry skin and harsh cleanser don’t work good on me. Not sure if it would be great for someone with oily skin. With oil you really have to work it so it creates a white coating/kind off a foam. Also very friendly for eye makeup as well.
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,love it!,I alternate between cleansing balm and cleansing oil. This bobbi brown cleansing oil wipes off all the toughest makeup. A little goes a long way. Makes ur face feeling fresh and clean after every use. Will restock!

Although is oil cleanser but not oily at all, can be raised easily! Sure will repurchase next time!!"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Must have,"Very hydrating product, not drying, after one usage, can feel the squeaky clean feel on the skin and no traces of makeup found. Will purchase more to stock up."
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Water-Like cleansing oil ,"One of the best cleansing oil I have ever tried. The formula is unlike any other cleansing oil, it’s lighter than other oils I have tried. It’s really like water and it doesn’t leave an oil film after rinsing it off. The lock design of the pump is a plus for me as well. No need to insert a stopper to prevent it from leaking. "
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,best oil cleanser,"Worth price. Slight better performance than Shu Uemura . Not oily, soft and make your skins comfortable . It won’t dry your face out, and yet no breakout caused by the product . This is the 4th bottle that I am using. Will continuous purchase."
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Canada,One of the best on the market!,"It’s a beautiful oil cleanser. I am so impressed!

BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,gentle cleansing oil,"Definitely will repurchase! This cleansing oil is able to clean all the makeup! Including mascara. Small amount needed and it’s very gentle. In fact, its very moist after using it. "
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,best cleansing oil,First time trying this cleansing oil!!! One of the best cleansing oil out there!!! It doesnt strip away skin moisture. Non drying and can cleanse your skin really well!!! Will repurchase
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Canada,not for me,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I got a sample of this and I was really excited to try it.  It didn’t even remove my kush mascara..  my skin broke out pretty bad..  thank you for letting me try this product but it doesn’t work for me.
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Less oily,"It is less oily than the Shu uemura. It has a more watery texture, yet it still melts my make up effortlessly. Love the smell as well, it gives a very soothing and therapeutic feeling. "
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,good product ,"It is a very good cleanser oil, I keep repurchases, it can easily remove the makeup, even the mascara and eyeliner, will repurchase forever. Highly recommended."
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Canada,AMAZING PRODUCT!,"THIS IS AMAZING! one of my favourite if not my favourite makeup removers. I always use this to take all my makeup off and it literally breaks up all the makeup on my face so easily, I have combo skin and breakouts but my skin can still handle it because it’s not to heavy. It is a bit pricey but still worth it"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,cleansing oil,"The BEST cleansing oil ever. Love it!! It cleanses well and easy to rinse off, leaving your skin soft and clean. This product lives up to its name. Can never leave without it. 
👍🏻"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,holy grail,"smooth texture easily emulsify. wash off easily no residue on your face. no break out for my combination skin. clean up make up fairly quick even for water proof make up. love it very much.
"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Love it,"I having a dry skin and when I use other cleansing oil, its make my skin super dry streching feeling after using it, but with this cleansing oil its really moisturise my skin and really work to remove all my makeup."
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Repurchase for years!,"I have been use this makeup removal for years with countless bottles! 
It leaves your skin so moisture and able to completely remove your makeup including eyeliner without leaving your eyes a stinging feeling.
Very highly recommended!"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,Why is this not more hyped??!!,"Why is no one talking about this product? It’s AMAZING. For us dry and combination skin girls, this cleanser works wonders. It completely removes my full face of makeup (including eyes) and leaves my skin so hydrated. It’s not going to be sudsy like a soap cleanser since it’s oil-based, so don’t expect that.

I use about 4 pumps each night to completely cleanse my face. You do add warm water and a washcloth for best results. I have very sensitive skin, and not only has this not caused irritation, my skin looks so much healthier. I think it’s a hidden gem & I’m thrilled I stumbled across it!!"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Canada,Bobbi Brown Soothing Cleansing Oil - 200ml,I love this product ! It works wonders and I love the feeling of my skin! It also helps to get rid of all my makeup residue!  I do find it rather pricy and the smell can definitely be an irritant if you’re sensitive !
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Canada,Awful smell,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) My review is based on a one-time use of a sample, and I'm comparing this to my experience with the Tatcha Camellia Cleansing Oil.

This oil has a really awful smell to it... I couldn't even focus on washing my face as I just needed to rinse it off as quickly as possible. I did notice that it emulsifies which is great, but otherwise, the smell is enough to drive me away."
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,Not worth the cost.,Just meh.... I don't think it's worth anywhere near $50. It's a decent cleansing oil and it works to take off water proof mascara etc. but that's what it's supposed to do. An I going to finish it up? Yes because it cost me $50. Am I going to repurchase? No!!!!! There are cleansing oils that work just as well for a fraction of the price.
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,ALL TIME FAV,Hands down ride or die product! Removes some of the dead skin while taking off makeup easliy. Light weight oil with a pleasing smell. Went through three bottles already!
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Ms,"Heard so much good review about this product and finally tried it out myself. Really love the feeling after using this cleansing oil, leaving the face hydrated and at the same time deep cleansing the face."
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Great product ,Love the light texture of this cleansing oil. Removes make up easily and thoroughly without drying skin nor feeling too greasy. Smells great too. Highly recommend this. 
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,i love it so much!!!!,"Im in love with this cleansing oil!!!!!! It remove my waterproof mascaraaaa and its not hurting my eyes!! I grab it on the 15% sale early this month, and get the smaller size for freeeeee"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,Make up comes off super easy without stress,I had this sample and I was surprised that it is a really good oil make up remover. Heavy make up came off really good and had no stress on my skin!
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,WOW!!!,"I hardly ever leave reviews, but I was so impressed by this. Usually I have to use one eye makeup remover and scrub forever to get it all off, then wash my face two or three times to get my face truly clean.  I had low expectations because I’ve never found a product that could do it all well. This took everything off completely in about 30 seconds. I’m so impressed! I also have very dry, sensitive eyes and it didn’t irritate them at all. Worth the money!"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore, very good cleanser,"The product has a mild scent, not overwhelming, not viscous, easy to glide through the face. Cleans pretty well. The only downside is that it’s expensive. Is it better than other cheaper cleanser like DHC, I don’t think so, but I enjoy using this "
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,light and calming,"It is a good cleansing oil, not causing breakout (so far that im using it) and having the calming scent but I will not repurchased because it is quite expensive for cleansing oil and I prefer korean cleansing balm as it acts the same way (to remove all dirts and makeup) with affordable price. "
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Australia,I love this product ,"I'm so impressed. I needed a quick affective cleanse and glad this was at hand. This oil is lush...it dissolved even my eye makeup and went on so easy...you only need a little bit and once you add water it milks up and cleanses skin gently, then rinses off leaving skin soft and fresh"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,Holy Grail Product!,"This is my holy grail facial cleanser! I have rosacea and very sensitive, dry skin. This is soothing, calming and smells delightful. I am also very sensitive to scents and that is a main concern when buying things online."
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,ah-mazing!!,"I have dry, sensitive ""mature"" skin and this oil cleanser doesn't irritate it or cause breakouts. It takes off everything and leaves my skin feeling hydrated but not oily at all. This is the first time I've tried an oil cleanser but I'm hooked!"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,greattt,"This is the best makeup remover oil I ever haddd
It’s work super well and don’t irritate skin at all
It work better than other brand of makeup remover,don’t think it’s expensive,even you put on makeup every day,it could use for at least 3months
I used five bottles,so far damn good❤️❤️❤️

"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,"Good stuff, a little pricey.",The cleansing oil is light and easy to use. It can remove the makeup and dirty on the face well. I deducted half star for its little high price. I may repurchase if there is a good discount.
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,love it,"have used various korean cleansing balms and oils before. quality of those come near to this. what makes this better is that it is a very light oil. i dont enjoy the feeling of a thicker consistency although i can wash it off. it also has a very calming scent to it which makes me look forward to removing my make up every time. it is so relaxing. definitely lux in this area. will repurchase definitely, and i dont see myself replacing this product ever. "
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,Not impressed.,My first time trying a oil based cleanser and I'm just not impressed. I have oily skin and I've hear time and time again that oil is actually better than harsher cleansers for oily/acne prone skin. I tried this one and i'm just not amazed with its ability to take off makeup or cleanse the skin. I have always been a huge fan of Bobbi Browns skincare products but on this one i'd definitely vote to save your money.
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,very clear ,"Very easy to use, not very oily, well emulsified, light in texture, and tastes good in jasmine. It suits my skin very well, cleans well, basic eyeliner and lip gloss can be removed"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,Bobbi Brown Soothing Cleansing Oil - 200ml,"This stuff is amazing! I am 48 with combination skin and this product really is fantastic. It smells great, feels great, removes make-up, and has helped clear my skin up!"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,Rather have Bare Minerals Oil Cleanser,"I had been using Bare Minerals' Oil Cleaner for years, and unfortunately couldn't purchase from them due to the pandemic. This Bobbi Brown cleanser was the closest I could find with Sephora, and was about $20 more expensive. So, I had high hopes.
Pros: smells nice, mostly does the job
Cons: takes about 50% more oil cleanser than the prior mentioned product per use, otherwise it feels rough on the face. It's a thinner product... like almost watered down. For being a higher end product, I wasn't very impressed."
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,melts away waterproof eye makeup so no scrubbing!,"Natural ingredients, waterproof makeup easily just melts away so minimizes scrubbing, esp eyes. Highly recommend"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,Bobbi Brown Soothing Cleansing Oil - 200ml,"I have gone thru many many bottles of this...sometimes I try something else, and the I regret is because nothing is as good as this cleanser. It gets everything off!! Unfortunately I also use it to wash my makeup brushes...which is def not cost effective but it seems to be the only thing that removes every last trace! I wish it was cheaper because I would buy two at a time...haha"
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,,light and not oily ,"The best face cleansing oil ever . and will repurchase again . Very nice to use and gently for face. and smell good , when apply on face , it’s easy to clean and not oily "
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,,Worth the price,I have tried several brands of cleansing oil brand from asian to western. To be jones this cleansing oil worth the price as its not as heavy as other brand. You don't need too much to clean up your face.  The feeling is like you are using micellar water to clean your face but eady to massage your face as its oil based. Definitely will buy again. 
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,Canada,Cleared up my eczema,"I am dealing with an eczema flare around my eyes and mouth, and was worried this would aggravate it, but it did the exact opposite. I've used it for 5 days now, and my only regret is that I didn't take a ""before"" picture to show the difference.The oil is very light, almost watery consistency, but don't let it fool you: it dissolved my waterproof Amore Pacific CC cream, as well as waterproof mascara with little mess. Additionally, there was no oily film on my eyes. I was using Farmacy Meltaway balm, but this is replacing it for as long as it is available."
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,Great Cleanser and make up,This is a very light wash not greasy at all. I generally use this After a day of make up. I use this first and follow up with cetaphil cleanser
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,Love but hard to travel with small amount,"Love this product, have been using for a decade, but recently tempted to switch because I cannot figure out a way to travel with it. All my little containers always leak, even the travel size container of this product from BB."
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,Bobbi Brown Soothing Cleansing Oil - 200ml,"I don’t usually buy high end or anything expensive as a broke college student, but this was something I got a sample of and I was so shocked with how my face looked after it took my makeup off. It was so effortless to get waterproof mascara off and my skin felt so soft and looked amazing. I had to get the full size. It’s a must have."
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,Nice cleansing oil for normal skin,I love the smell of this product. Very calming and elegant. It removes makeup very well and doesn't dry up my skin at all. It doesn't irritate my eyes either.
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,Bobbi Brown Soothing Cleansing Oil - 200ml,"The first time I order this item, it came with an empty bottle and the whole package was leaking, the second time I order this one, I didn't receive​ any package at all. I probably won't order again."
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil,USA,Bobbi Brown Soothing Cleansing Oil - 200ml,"This has been my fav oil cleansers to use to gently clean my sensitive skin without being too harsh. I’m doing a lot of skin treatments, i. e. chemical peels, microneedling And hydrafacials . Would recommend. It’s a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,works,"this help me a lot with my acne..those ingredients expecially salicylic acid really made this cleanser worth buying ,,totally gonna repeat it 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,its good,"I found this product did improve my overall complexion but ONLY when I used my manual face brush. When I was using it with my hands for a good week (in conjunction with the special cucumber lotion) I felt like little or nothing changed. It also doesn't foam. When I started the manual face brush and really scrubbed it into my pores, I noticed a difference in two days."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Facial Cleanser,"This cleanser does its job in cleaning out impurities from the face. The design of the bottle isnt the best as the bottle cap can break when kept within bag. Other than that, the product is a good cleanser."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,cleanser,Doesn’t work for me. Texture is slimy type. No foam kinda cleanser. And still have acne coming despite using this twice a day. Not worth getting it. IT cleanser is better. 
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Mario Badescu Acne Facial Cleanser,"My face stays oil free till next wash, skin feels deeply cleansed, highly recommended for oily & combination skin, loved it’s packaging, product design simple and product description detail & informative. Will continue to use."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Acne Facial Cleanser,I gave this a try because I thoroughly enjoy a few of the other products by this company but it honestly doesn’t help with acne control.
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,best for acne skin ,"I find this cleaner really best suit for those who has acne.. it is mild and not causing any skin sensitivity after wash. I been using this for 3rd bottled 
"

It’s gentle and effective.You  only need a small amount to get your face feeling clean and fresh. We Read more about review stating We love this face wash!highly recommend this product. 
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Didn’t help with my acne,So I don’t think this is a solid acne cleanser like it is labeled. I have very acne-prone skin and this product feels more like a makeup remover cleanser. It did not help with my acne nor did it thoroughly cleanse my face. I finished the bottle bc I didn’t want to waste the product. There are better products to treat acne
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Ok,"I have oily skin and it definitely helped to control the oil production. However, I found that it overly dried my skin out and caused my skin to feel very stripped."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Philippines,Not effective,I finished the whole bottle but my acne didn't improve. Found cheaper products more effective than this.
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Fantastic cleaner,I can see the difference now after I use it this cleaner..It clear my Acne.. now my face look more healthy.. And I love the way the natural smell comes from this cleanser.. totally worth it
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,not a normal routine,I got the sample and it works on me. I help from my skin to be worst with acnes. I like the texture of the cleanser and i like how it works on my skin.. i used it twice a day in the morning and evening and so far my skin is working fine with this product
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Disappointed. didn't work on my skin. total waste of money. ,"Disappointed. Didn't work on my skin. total waste of money. I purchased this, thinking it would help with my breakout. 3 weeks in to using this product, but still nothing changed. "
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,good quality ,"Will recommend this product as it is effective and worth the price paid. Will definitely recommend it to those whom need it. Value for the money paid. However, the product received is overpack again."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,My husband love it,"I bought this for my husband as he has skin condition, very active acne skin type and this cleanser helped in controlling oil production but not drying. His skin is better now"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,good in treating acne,At the age of late 30s I am still suffering from acne and this product has given fast result! My acne dries quickly. Everyone who has similar problem should give it a try. 
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,acne cleanser,I got it for my teenage son. Nothing amazing so we go back to our previous one which works well and much more easier to purchase outside. Maybe it is not strong enough for acne on teenagers face. 
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,MB facial wash,Used it while experiencing adult acne. Helped to calm down my skin. Help tremendously for the redness and acne. Highly recommended for oily skin. 
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Acne Facial Cleanser,"Mario Badescu is life for me, this stuff keeps my skin clean and clear of any break outs and if I happen to get one the spot treatment works wonders and this is coming from someone that most of my young adult life battled acne."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Manager ,My son favourite cleanser! He try using other brand and he still prefer this most! 
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Will buy again,"Definitely saw changes in how often my acne pops out (if you know what I mean ladies - we have cycles!). So nearing the time of the month, my face becomes oilier but lesser acne now because of this. One bottle lasts 2 months for me for day/night wash. Slightly drying so rmbr to use moisturizer after"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Ms,"It really works. My skin is brighter, clearer. Bye bye acne."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,eh,"So I’ve had this on my skin care shelf for awhile, and I’ll reach for it every now and then, although it makes my skin soft it does not do much for my combination oily skin, or much for my acne."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Caution,This product did not visibly clear acne. It also did not seem to prevent acne or blemishes. The gel was also drying out my face.
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Meh,"It’s fine. I does help with my acne, but it leaves my face with that feeling comparable to using a cheap bar of soap. It’s too drying for my face and now I’m only using it for the occasional breakout on my back. I’d look elsewhere for acne cleansers :/"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,love it,"i love this product. so far this is the best thing i ever purchase. no regret at all.. love it love it. 

Neeed to repurchase this product since me n husband sharing our skincare. He also love it and now it even faster to finish it
"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,fav cleanser ,Started using this product and noticed my break outs gotten lesser. Will recommend if you have acne prone skin. Doesn’t dry out my skin as well like other cleanser!
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,ok product ,Made my skin a bit dry which made me feel that it helps to dry the acne away. Overall it's an okay product and not that bad. Good if you have an oily prone skin 
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Too drying ,I have acne prone dry skin and this product did nothing for me. Made my skin very tight and dry after washing and I did not see much improvement on the acne. Had to use a heavy moisturiser to prevent my skin from completely drying out. Will not be repurchasing
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,not for dry skin,"my skin is acne prone dry and sensitive, i feel that this cleanser is suitable for oily skin with acne prone skin, becoz my skin is dry and i feel uncomfartable feeling after wash my face using this cleanser, maybe should try cleanser for sensitive skin."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,New Zealand,Ok,There were alot of hype about this product and brand but honestly it made no difference to my skin. It did not help my acne. It did left my face clean and smooth but that's pretty much it.
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,affordable and useful,"one year on, i still have this. feel clean and doesnt dry up my skin after washing. the smell is also nice not like too much parfum. however  cant wait to finish this as Ive bought another facial wash"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Philippines,My skin is better,"Writing this review after a few weeks of using the product. For me, it's effective. It lessens my acne breakouts. But it doesn't work like magic 'cause I'm still getting breakouts sometimes. So it's not bad. Maybe a little expensive but the whole bottle will last long, still worth it. "
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Philippines,Just okay,Nothing special. Cleans my face just fine. But needs to double clean to remove make up. Didnt see any difference or effect on my acne. Price is just right.
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,acne starts to deplete,"I had an outbreak due to wearing a face mask all day at work, so i decided to try this product. And it works on my oily, acidic and sensitive skin. What i like about this is the smell and the freshness i feel after every wash. I just hope they will come on a bigger package."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,my acne problem reduced,"I have tried this product since my face has a problem with acne on the chin. After almost a month of trying, this product turned out to reduce my skin irritation. After washing I will make sure to use a moisturizer because this product can make the face dry. So here you need to know the nature of your own skin if you want to try. thank you."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,breakouts,"it says it will treat existing pimples and prevent future pimples but it does not. for my case, after using it the first time i had breakouts the next day. i didnt realized it was the product causing the acne till i stop using it. it was the only new product i was trying. its such a disappointment and a waste."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,A little harsh for sensitive skin,"I have oily and sensitive skin. This product helps with the former, but not so much with the latter. It dries up the skin, so would be best to pair this with moisturiser and/or serum that has moisturising properties. But most importantly: it does its job in reducing acne and blemishes."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,BADESCU Acne Facial Cleanser,"Good product but doesn't help with acnes that much. I have acnes beneath my skin and it will not work on those. I have tried PTR acne cleanser as well but same and none will work. It smells a bit weird and comparing toPTR acne cleanser is less drying for your face. So if you have dry sentitive skin, it's more suitable and gentel"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,did nothing,"it really did nothing to my face. i have an acne prone skin so i was interested in this product. but sadly, it did nothing. it didnt help w reducing the breakouts or calming down the acnes. it also didnt cause any more irritation or cause more breakouts tho. it didnt really foams up. i felt like just massaging water on my face. overall, i didnt like it"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Take time.,"My friend has been using this for one month and his skin is fairer, however the acne problem is still the same. It might be because his body system mechanism including hormones but to rate the effectiveness of this cleanser as acne cleanser, 3 stars is enough."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Decent Cleanser,"The cleanser did the job however for my skin it didn't help as best as other products i have tested. wanted to try something new, not dissapointed but wouldn't buy it for my skin. However, i reccommend if anyone is looking for an acne cleanser this might be it for you!"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,"Not buying again, but not throwing out.","I'll finish the bottle I bought, but it isn't going a great job at controlling acne and is making my skin a bit sensitive. Seems to have some fragrance in it that I'm not into."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Great cleanser,love the smell of this and it is helpful for my acne! it is slightly drying
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,repeat purchase,Before this i buy in trial pack and i found this cleanser suitable with my skin so i bought in big bottle. The cleanser no bubble and not make your acne become black so i think this cleanser do great job. No smell
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Philippines,so-so product ,"Had high expectations for this product but I personally found it to be so-so. Didn’t really do anything life-changing — didn’t help much with my acne and occasional breakouts, but also didn’t cause me to breakout. I probably wouldn’t repurchase this product again but maybe it’s just my skin type. "
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,not working on my skin,I’m using this for around 35 day but couldn’t see any visible changes. Maybe it’s not suitable for my skin I guess. However I won’t recommend this product as I fell it not worth the money.
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Effective!,"My youngest son have acne prone skin. My eldest one started getting mild breakout from frequent wearing of masks. Bought this and Clear Start for them. They both work very well, greatly reduce their acne problem. Just started this product while they had used one bottle of Clear Start. One of them prefer this as it gives a better after-wash feel.while the other feels both products are equal. I believe it's personal preference."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,decent,"This specific cleanser doesn’t dry out the skin after using, unlike most acne facial washes. It gives a balanced feel. Nothing to complain about, would repurchase"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,amazing,"I bought this for my brother. This product really amaze me. All the pimples gone, only the scar left. Im going to repeat the second bottle for him. 🤭 he really excited with his skin now, thanks to mario madescu 😬😂"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,BestEver,Best Cleanser ever Use for Acne ..Its Work n U have to use it gently ..n its smooth n clean your face..recomended for acne face n open pores ..its contain saliycid acid the good for acne face .
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Acne Facial Cleanser,"Acne facial cleanser from mario badescu was good on my face. This is my third purchase from sephora. To be honest, i love everything from mario badescu. "
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,love this!,"I first tried It when i bought the kit pack for acne, since Im currently facing maskne problem, and I can say that it helps me alot. The scent is almost toner like, but it will definitely make you feel you face is clean. The size will go a long way maybe around 3-5months, it depends, for myself I use it morning & evening. Thumbs up for this product"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,good cleanser,combination facial cleanser and dry lotion is a good combination product.. my acne dry with the lotion and my skin was very2 soft after use this facial cleanser.. 
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Acne Facial Cleanser,I have to scrub hard and do 2-3 washes in order to feel fully cleansed.
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,great cleanser,smells a little like detergent. but great cleanser for those suffering breakouts. just make sure u spend time massaging the product into the skin when cleansing.
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Moderate,There is none significant effect. Maybe it just not suitable with my skin and it kinda cause my face to be dry. I think i should try other kind of cleanser.
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,not much of a visible result,"After finishing the whole bottle, my acne might have only soothed for like 10%, which is not what i expected. Definitely not repurchasing it in the future. Found a cheaper alternative that works"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Acne Facial Cleanser,My skin felt very dry after using nothing special about it
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Not drying,This gel cleanser is refreshing and not drying on my skin after usage.  The cleanser doesn't have much bubbles and any strong scent of fragrance.               
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,amazing,repeat purchase as it controls the oil on my face after each wash. am buying this bottle for my girl friend who is also a combi skin like mine to try it out. 
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,strong but effective,a little bit of this product goes a long way. It definitely does a good job of keeping away the hormonal break outs of my 41 yr old combination skin. keep product well away from the whole eye area though as the area around my eye went all red and puffy after the first time i used this
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Philippines,Effective,This is an effective facial wash to treat acne. Been using for a month and my face is now more clear. Smell is also very nice. Will purchase again. Thank you.
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Acne Facial Cleanser,"I have combination skin. I have used this for about a week now and I think it has helped with my acne. My small forehead acne is clearing up and I haven’t had any breakouts of a big pimple yet. Only thing is the smell is kinda strong and you can smell the alcohol, but other than that it is good. Also as other people said it is very gentle which is nice."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Acne Facial Cleanser,This product helped with my acne so much . Also it’s a gentle cleanser.
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,not for oily skin,I have combination oily acne prone skin. I used this in the morning and within 2 hours after use face was super oily again. Hasnt done much for acne either. Definitely wont repurchase. I think more suited for dry skin
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,The,"Repeat buyer of this cleanser for years. Tried many other cleansers before and this is still my favourite, my skin doesnt get oily for a longer period of time compared to kiehls and fresh. Doesnt dry out my skin either and it smells nice to me. 5 stars good job"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Choose Ren Instead,Don't recommend for oily and acne prone skin. Recommend Ren instead. I love Ren products!
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Philippines,love this ♥️,"the best for acne prone skin like me..... it helps control oil without over drying your face 😊 does it job pretty well, pLanning to purchase another bottle soon..."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,So so,Bought it during the sales as my regular Dr Jart cleanser was out of stock. Does it's job well enough. Doesn't leave skin too dry or taut. Not a big fan as I personally prefers a slightly more foamy cleanser. 
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Acne Facial Cleanser,I have used proactiv for over 10 years and I was in the market for something more affordable yet with the same results. This works just as well. I didn't experience the initial breakout with switching products. Very minimal is needed when using which should allow the product to last about 4 months.
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Starter Acne Skincare,I used this product for two years and it got my acne under control. I had to change it out for a stronger one because of hormonal changes but would recommend for basic acne skincare. My skin did not feel dry after using it and overall it felt refreshed.
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,good cleanser,"This cleanser is gel type texture .. if you have acne skin can give it a try , can clean your skin without drying but still helps to oil control .. One bottle can last me around 4 month . Really like it !"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Good,"You need to know how to apply this properly. It will remove any sebum, dirt and greasy stuff on the face if you apply/rub it in circle for a few more seconds than usual what is done. It’s super clean after that. "
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Great for controlling acne ,"I was a bit sceptical over this initially because there hasnt been a cleanser which controls my acne. But this product has been great, I've seen reduction in the amount of acne popping up ever since using it. I like that it's really gentle as well, since my skin can be rather sensitive. "
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Does the job,It does what it's supposed to do. Nothing more and nothing less. It doesn't dry out my skin after wash which I am really glad for because I was using the entire acne prone skin range from Mario Badescue. 
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Absolutely love it,"I've been struggling to find a good face wash that works on my skin, and I never did until I found this product. I use this with the Cucumber Lotion, the Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs & Rosewater and the Drying Cream. My skin has really cleared up from before I used this product and I would really recommend this to those struggling with acne. "
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Acne Facial Cleanser,"I have combo skin, EVERY face wash dries my skin out and then causes my skin to over produce oil. I’ve also been breaking out a ton recently. I was using the enzyme cleanser and I really liked the gel texture and that it didn’t dry me out, but I really needed something for acne. I’m not sure what ingredients are in this that actually fight acne but most acne washes contain ingredients like salicylic acid which don’t work for me, it’s too rough on my skin. This and the enzyme cleanser are great though for being gentle. I’ve been using this along side the ordinary niacinamide and zinc serum and my acne is almost gone and hadn’t been coming back."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Contains Isopropyl Alcohol,Contains Isopropyl Alcohol! So drying!! face feels tight and dry for days after.  Would not recommend if you have acne yet dry skin.
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Not for me,"This is great if you’re cleansing a naked face. The little make up I usually wear still gets left behind after using this, but it doesn’t irritate my skin. It is very gentle and is similar to cetaphil. The biggest turn off is the alcohol smell. Not sure if anyone else smells that when using this product! 

Overall: contains alcohol, but isn’t totally drying. Works for a bare face, and leaves behind make up if you are wearing any. If you’re going to get this, spend it on cetaphil which is $5-$10 cheaper."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Amazing,"Been trying few product, from drugstore to curated, only this one show effect after 5 days of using it. My cystic acne reduced significantly and reducing some of white heads too (i think the exfoliating effect). Smells nice too. Will definitely repurchase."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Great!,"I have repurchased this product multiple times, love how it cleans my face. I love how it's gentle on the skin. The only thing is that because it doesn't foam, I feel like i have the tendency to use too much. "
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Mario Badescu Acne Facial Cleanser,"Mario Badescu Acne Facial Cleanser - At first I was using this product with a 13 steps skincare routine and it did not work. To start off with, I had bad skin due to me not using anyform of skincare for almost 5 months. Prior to that my skin was clear, very clear. I am not prone to getting pimples, textured skin etc. However recently my skin broke out like crazy. I used this cleanser together with a toner twice a day, and it seems to fade off the impurities on my face, just that it is taking reallllly long for it to clear off everything. This cleanser does not foam up as much however, it does work in clearing gunk out from your face. Will re purchase to see how many bottles to clear off the nasties on my skin. "
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,"smells ok, ni result yet",oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah oklah
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,acne skin,"My skin is oily and break out often. I bought the original size after I tried out the acne trial set. Love the texture of the facial wash, it does not leave ur skin dry after you wash your face. "
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Good,Didn’t cause any break out. Gentle on the skin. Feels clean without the squeaky feeling. overall i think it helped with calming breakouts as well.....
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,AMAZING,"This cleanser is my holy grail! My skin improved so much and this has been my go to for years! I had super bad acne on my face and was giving up on finding the cure, but then I took a leap and have no regrets whatsoever! Definitely will repeat when it runs out"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Nice product,I like it as a cleanser. It doesn’t do much by itself but is great with an exfoliating brush or scrubber.
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,good for acne,"I love that this product doesn’t strip the moisture off my face despite having salicylic acid!! Also, I realised that whenever I have bumps that will later become pimples, this acne cleanser somehow stops it the bumps from become bigger (so the bumps later went away without actually developing into pimples) yeay!!!!"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,My acne almost gone for good. ,"I have sensitive skin after my Pigmentation Laser and have a major breakout. Before this I try so many acne cleanser for my acne problem, but nothing is working. After read some reviews I try this MB acne cleanser, now my acne reduce a lot eventhough it took some times. Now I'm purchasing my 2nd bottle 😁"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,MB Cleanser,"I should’ve bought this cleanser earlier!! Way way earlier, this is my 2nd bottle and I’m loving it! It clears up my skin... no more tiny bumps on my forehead, t-zone, cheeks... I have oily skin and this product is perfect because it contains salicylic acid. So love!"
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Acne Facial Cleanser,"This product does wonders, at least for me. Some times i break out and since i found this is not an issue anymore. I wash my face at night with cleanser and if is a small breakout the nest day i i don’t have anything and my face is like a baby if is really bad i will take me about two days. I am definitely buying another one."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Not Buying This Ever Again,"I bought this product thinking that it would do wonders, but in reality it feels like nothing. It doesn't create suds and it does not show results. Save your money and stick with Cera Ve."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Acne Facial Cleanser,didn’t do anything for me if anything made my acne worse.i recently have discovered more about this brand and id say spend your money else where the ordinary and cerave have much better products!!
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,good ,"Bought this for my little brother. He got kinda lots acne on his face. Finished about a bottle, and He said his acne less and lesser. So happy for him. "
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Would definitely buy again,"After using this product every night before bed for a week straight, I am able to notice significant positive changes in my skin. My acne has almost completely cleared up and my skin looks much healthier! This cleanser is perfect for sensitive skin and is not over-drying."
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Not working for me ☹️,"I purchased this product because it is highly recommended by so many people and they are claiming that this product helped their acne problem. But mine got worst! At first I thought my skin is just purging, but it’s been 3 months that I’ve been using it and everyday my acne problem is getting worst ☹️ maybe because it has alcohol content. "
MARIO BADESCU-Acne Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Works well,I used to have a bad breakout but after using this it was under control. Good product. Will definitely continue using. The bottles lasted me for 5 months !
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,So nice with oily skin,Love love love!! This lamer FOAM cleanser so muchhh!!! I am super oily skin OMGGGGGG  best everr
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Best for Dry Skin,"Abit on the high end though good for dry and aging skin. After wash, face will not feel any tightness or itchy or tearing. Feel fresh, soft and smooth after washing. Is my third purchase 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 will buy again and again.  "
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,laMer,Can last very long.usually i use it for evening routine.a bit already enough.my skin very dry so not for morning…this is first LaMer product i purchased.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,good,it's abit expensive but it's a nice foam cleanser. my face not feeling any tight or dry feeling after using it to clean my face. not bad will repurchase it in future. 
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,Perfect for aging skin!,Perfect for my combination aging skin! I have tried so many luxury face cleansers and this has been the best cleanser by far. I would not use it if you have dry skin though! My skin is prone to hormonal acne and this has completely transformed the texture of my skin. A little goes a long way - it is highly concentrated so I use a pea sized amount on my PMD wand.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Excellent cleanser,"I really enjoy using this lamer cleanser, not so foamy, it cleans excellently....can feel the clean effect on my face and yet it doesnt make ur face dry post op...i just love it
This is my third purchase"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,ms,"It was just normal for me. Maybe it did not suit my skin. I did not suffer any break out or whatsoever but there was no improvement at all to my skin after using this product. Besides, it’s very pricey."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,La Mer,i bought it during sales. have not try it yet. it was expensive for a 30ml. will give it a try since the review was good. Hopefully it will suit my skins.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,Nope,"Trashed it. Didn’t foam and stripped my skin. Pluses are that it’s not heavily scented and it’s lathering. If I had oily skin or wore heavier makeup, I could see liking this more. But definitely not for me."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Good,"I have dry skin and I really recommend people with dry skin to get this as after washing, my skin doesn’t feel dry and feels clean. Overall good product. Can try the smaller size before getting the full size product. "
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Goood and expensive ,"Real good, it have small particle( idk what it call) which help to exfoliate and it’s create load of small bubble when rubbing and it smell just nice the only cons is very pricey"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Good,Love it so much! Bought this on sale. Suitable for oily and I guess for dry skin also. It washes and melts the makeup and makes my face so clean and plumpy after using this cleanser.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Meh,"It was an okay so-so product for me, not really suitable for my skin types and it’s too overrated. Definitely could find other products that are much better and cheaper than this. "
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Foam - 30ml,Skin feels clean after use. A little bit goes a long way. Won’t use any other cleanser on my face. Will continue to buy.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,nice,"Love this. I didn’t have very positive experience with La Mer products when I was younger. I felt they are more suited to non tropic weather. But I felt in the last decade they started to expand their products to suit more markets and skin types, and also I’m aged since LOL. This foaming cleanser feels foamy rich and leave a baby powder smell. Not my top 1 yet but I will buy again in the next sales. "
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,cleaning foam ,Will repurchase this again for the 2nd time. Like the texture of this cleansing foam. Bought this during Sephora 20% sales for black and gold members. Worth it
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,love it,"I do used la mer products’s range. And i love it. It 
fresh up my face after used it day n night. I love their smells too. It doesn’t make my skin any big changes which is good. I keep repurchased it in travel size because easy to carry. Thank you la mer for good products ."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,strong cleanser with a pleasant smell,Strong cleanser that leaves my skin squeaky clean but can be drying if used daily. I use it alternatively with other cleanser to prevent my skin from drying out.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,the best cleansing foam,"Love the luxurious texture, it is non drying and skin feels soft and clean after cleansing. Foams nicely and I enjoyed the soothing smell. Looks great on the bathroom shelf too. "
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Drying,"I decided to buy a small size to give it a try. This product is very disappointing in comparison with other La Mer products. After using this facial foam my skin  very dry after each use. After a month of using it, my skin still feels dry. "
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,The Cleansing Foam,"A light wash to soften, comfort and nourish, energizing skin for a bright, fresh, healthy-looking complexion. As an advocate of double cleansing regimen, my wish is for Sephora MY to bring in The Cleansing Oil as well. Thank you!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Nice,Bought the small one to try out. Good size for travelling. Not disappointing at all. This is my second best cleanser after SKII. A little goes a long way. It has just a little smell like tea...which I like even though I don't like perfume in my skincare. This is definitely not perfumy but just fresh smelling. I'll definitely repurchase this.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,First time,"A gorgeous foaming cleanser.
Really helps to clean your face and takes away all your make up without make your skin feel dry.
It’s my first time to use this cleanser and it’s not disappointing."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,feels good but drying,It is drying on my combination skin and my cheeks feel tight and dry. good thing I tried the small size first. I like the texture and the subtle scent but I will look further.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Daily grail ,My holy grail product. Prefer the foam wash to the cleansing gel. Helps to tighten the skin and feel fresh all the time. Can’t wait to get more!!! Would recommend the lip balm also
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,best cleanser ever,Initially bought a small bottle to try and finished it really fast as I love it so much! It really cleanses your skin thoroughly without leaving the skin too dry. Smells really nice too and lathers nicely. Bought extra during the sale!
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,Perfect,I didn't even try the sample size first. I went ahead and got a full bottle and it worked out for me. I like this face cleanser a lot. and I will probably buy it again.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Good high end cleanser ,"The best facial cleanser so far. Clean well and does not make the skin dry. Left the skin feel refreshing, clean and soft. The bad side is it is a bit pricey"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,leaves skin feeling dry and tight,"Foams nicely and gets the skin clean, but it is very drying. Like crazy skin tight on the face feeling where it feels like it’s dying for moisturizer. Definitely a pass on this. I know foaming cleansers have a tendency to do this but there are some much better cleansers for much less, which foam and don’t dry you out."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Canada,La Mer The Cleansing Foam - 30ml,"I have combination and sensitive skin and it did not work for me. The smell of the cleanser is like that of a hotel soap. After use, my acne worsened and the skin became redder. I don't know why so many people rated it as their fav cleanser, definitely not for me, not worth the price."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,good,Tried before and really like it. I have very dry skin so this cleanser does not make me feel dry after using. Small tube goes a long way.                                  
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,Love this face wash worth the $$$,It amazing face wash love it makes u face feel soft and clean. A little goes a long way  nice and bubbly  pea size is all u need
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,lamer cleanser,"i just received this product recently havent try yet but i love to complete the whole set as i want to see the effect if i change to this skincare routine, super expensive would love to purchase on sale"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,La Mer Cleansing Foam,"La Mer products are really trustworthy. So far, this is the best cleansing foam i love to use very much. It is foamy enough yet it doesn't feel like drying or stripping the skin. The small tube packaging is very convenient and i can carry it with me in my pouch too. "
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Canada,May good for oily skin,"love LA Mer products except this cleansing form which I used three times with high hope of moisturizing but it actually stripes out of all my skin moisture.
I am returning this sadly."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Foam - 30ml,Absolutely love this. I’ve spent tons of money and time trying to find the best cleanser. This is it. Won’t go without it!
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Foamy and nice smelling ,Satisfactory cleansed feeling after usage. Nice foam build up but not really seeing the effects to skin improvement. Considering to repurchase………………..
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,Holy Grail / Nothing Compares,"This is hands down my holy grail cleanser. I have tried almost every cleanser for combination/oily skin just to find a backup for if this is sold out or ever not in my budget, I can’t even find a backup. It’s the only thing that thoroughly cleanses my skin and that keeps me from breaking out. This, the toner, and the gel cream *chefs kiss*"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,good,"Very good, nice design. Worth for the prices, still using.
Good quality, good looking. For normal use. Worth to
buy when 25%. Feeling nice and pretty good. Apps
friendly."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Love it,Tried it for the first time and I really enjoyed using it. Lovely cleanser which cleanses my face really well and skin doesn’t feel dry thereafter. Only drawback is probably the price tag which is slightly hefty.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Ms,Very nice to use…….                                                               ……..                                                                                      ……
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,an okay cleanser!,not a fan of this cleanser as my skin felt so dry after using it. the smell is quite strong for me.  i also had a breakout. this might work for someone but not for me. not worth the price.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,expensive but good,"This is truly a quality product. It works well for my sensitive skin even though I use it daily, twice a day. It thoroughly cleanses my skin without drying it. "
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Best!,It doesn’t makes my skin feels dry. Soo good!
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,la mer,"LA MER CLEANSING FOAM is a luxurious cleansing  foam that does a beautiful job of removing a full face of make up and the day's grime. It has a beautiful light green appearance and comes out fairly thick, like most cleansing foams the concentration is quite thick so only a small amount is needed to create a large amount of foam with water. It is one of my all time favourite cleansing foams in the luxury market"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,good,Very good will come back again Very good will come back again Very good will come back again Very good will come back again Very good will come back again Very good will come back again Very good will come back again Very good will come back again 
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Exquisite!,Feels very luxurious and velvety. Skin is thoroughly cleansed but the price is super hefty and there are a lot of products out there that works the same but cost half the price.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Foam - 30ml,Did not see anything specific after using it. Not worth the money. But the overall skin feels clean after.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,"not suitable for my skin, wont repurchase ","I find this too drying and stripping for my skin, my face is on the drier side so might be suitable for oily skin? And for the price, i would expect a more luxury and sophisticated scent. There’s better cleanser out there imo."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,i’ll stick with this,"I love lamer products. This cleansing foam is not my favourite but i just cannot use other brand anymore because I’m comfortable using this brand. I really love the smell, so natural so clean and soothing. Its quite drying the face but not tooo dry. I just love the way it is. So sad because it’s too expensive. "
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,LA MER The Cleansing Foam,LA MER The Cleansing Foam was expecting more from the brand and the price I paid. 
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,My all time favorite cleanser,This is my favorite cleanser of all time. You only need a tiny bit activated with water to get lots of foaming action. The foam is very hydrating and leaves your skin feeling clean and soft. I have been buying this cleanser for many years.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Ordinary Cleanser,It is just like any other ordinary cleanser out there. The price for this is just not worthy & you can find many other facial cleansers out there with a better price. Don't know if it is just myself; but I found the scent a little strong as well. 
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,so so,"While this cleanser does its job, it is not fantastic. I use both La Mer and Shiseido’s FX Future Solution cleansers. It is rather apparent that Shiseido is better. Considering the price of this cleanser, I would not recommend it. However, this cleanser smells good and can make you feel relaxed when washing your face."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,Overhyped and overpriced,"This cleanser is not bad, but it does not live up to the hype."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Foam - 30ml,"This cleanser for me was just too drying. I have combination/ oily skin. So, that’s saying a lot. The smell of it is so fresh though! Very soothing and just smells clean. Sadly, won’t be repurchasing though."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Costly but worth it!,"Had oily & acne’s skin since young, even grow pimples after 30yo, couldn’t find any face washing foam to help with my face. Until 1 of the sales from airport recommended me with this washing foam to me, & I am stuck with this forever I think. It really really helps to clear oily skin, & I think this is my 6 or 7 tubes already. The price is on the high end, but definitely worth it, & my 125ml I can use for approx 3 months. Highly recommend to oily skin people, if they don’t mind the price. ☺️👍"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Canada,THE BEST,Your search for the perfect cleanser is over. Watch as this transforms your face into the best version of itself.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Canada,Loved,"Love this cleaning form !! My skin feel so soft and smooth, I’m also use The lotion treatment and the moisturizing cream after cleaning form  I’m so happy that I decided to purchased Lammer products it’s an expensive but it lasted long time you only need a little bit !!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Canada,La Mer Does it Again,"I adore this cleansing foam for morning skin care routines. Firstly, the simple packaging and bottle speaks to La Mer’s incredible marketing team. However the real beauty is in the product itself. A turquoise blue cream comes out of the bottle and smells incredible, almost musky and certainly more on the unisex side of things as if reminded me on a good Tom Ford cologne. This stuff has instant results, feels amazing on the skin and within a week I noticed acne reduction, tighter skin, smaller pores and overall I just felt like I was glowing based off my complexion from my new routine. Very much a product that can and should be used by both men and women. Saving up for the famous La Mer Moisturizer and Eye Cream next as I would like to see what a purely La Mer product routine would do for my skin. Incredible stuff and would recommend trying the smaller bottle first at an amazing price point of $35 for a company known to be at the top of the food chain for beauty products."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,no breakouts!,One of the best face washs I have ever used you feel so clean!!! So freaking fresh and lives your skin looking like a million dollars it’s pricey but it’s worth it
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,Expensive but works,"I’ve been using this for years, the only one that works for my dry and sensitive face, it’s quite expensive but last me for a year or so I also used lamer moisturizer. I recommend this product if you’re willing to pay more money"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,My Forever Cleanser Foam,"In terms of texture, this cleanser lathers up really well and it leaves my combination skin refreshed and squeaky clean without feeling tight or dehydrated. I apply a little amount over the damp face, and gently massage over face in small circle motions. Using just a little would go a long way. The foam has a silky texture. As soon as it is in contact with water, it starts to dissolve and the color turns from pearly green to white. It is very easy to lather up into foaming bubbles. The foam is so rich and gentle that leaves my face thoroughly cleansed, soft and clear without being dry, tight, or irritating. Really love it😍"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Foam - 30ml,"I have very dry, sensitive, acne prone skin. I was using proactive plus for months and it was amazing to my skin, however I felt like there was something missing, so I have been trying different products. This product has been okay. I’m not in love with it, but it wasn’t terrible. It gave me a “clean feeling” after the first time using it and immediately looked brighter. I did notice a couple of small pimples pop up the next day so I’m not sure if this product triggered that to occur, but overall I’m going to continue using until it’s finished and will not be buying again."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,love this above all other cleansers !,"Love this face wash . It is amazing , smells clean , and a little bit goes a very long way . This could last me almost a year so I feel it’s worth it !"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,Pricey BUT I Love,"I really love this face wash, especially after a long day. I feel like it really digs in and cleans out everything. It does smell a lot like Irish Spring soap, but I don’t mind that. It also leaves a “tight” feeling on the skin, but again, I don’t mind that. It is pricey for what it is which is why I’d knock down a star. A little goes a long way so I see it lasting a while though. I’d say buy the $25 one first, and if you like it, splurge on the full size."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Canada,La Mer The Cleansing Foam - 30ml,It was okay - an average foamy cleanser. I have oily skin and still had breakouts while using this cleanser.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,meh,this product has a strong smell to my liking as i preferred scentless skincare product. hurt my eyes and too drying to my combi skin. wouldn’t repurchase 
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,mrs,"Bought trial size initially, tried once and It smells fresh and very soft on skin, feels moisturised. Will buy full size later when offer / promotion."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,average,"The Smell of this cleanser is too strong if u have sensitive nose. However it feels really fresh and cleans well , without any tightness feeling after that.I will not recommend this if u have sensitive nose or allergic rhinitis, because the smell is sharp and causes sneezing afterwards."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Truly a luxurious experience ,"The size is small but the foam itself is thick hence a small amount goes a long way. The smell is nice, like a natural scent with no artificial fragrant"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Canada,La Mer The Cleansing Foam - 30ml,Skin feels squeaky clean after every wash. It’s a bit drying so watch out if you have dry skin in the winter. I have oily skin so I enjoy this all year long.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,ms,"Not for me, it coz my skin breakout & I really frustrated about it...i hv combi skin and hv tried Estée, skII, Dior, kiehl's & clinique but this is the worst for me...not worth a penny...no more la mer products on my list..."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,not to be used in winter,"It was good to be used in summer. However, in fall/winter, it's too drying for my skin."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,perfect for combinación skin,"I have sensitive combination skin and it’s challenging to find a cleanser that works great for combination skin. I’ve tried so many cleansers and they never work. Either they would dry my skin or made it break out. until I found La mer cleansing foam. It leaves my skin perfect. It balances out the oily part of my skin as well as the dryer side. It has a light pleasant scent , and it makes your skin feel fresh and clean. FYI if you use a little too much it may make skin feel a little dry. Only use about a dime size. A little pricey but it’s worth 100%!!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Ms,"I like the texture, soft and quickly lather on skin. A little goes a long way for this cleanser, you need a small amount for the cleansing. My skin feels fresh and not dry at all after washing. Smells nice and luxury and not strong. "
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,LA MER - The Cleansing Foam,"Hi Babe out there , I would like to share about this awesome La Mer Cleansing Foam. I brought for smaller size to try out on my sensitive skin and oily as well . I have try out other luxuries and well known facial cleansing foam , for example SK-ll , Chanel , Dior , and more other luxury facial products. I can’t use normal facial foam as my face are sensitive and oily skin , after my aunt recommended me to try this out . As I was shopping online with Sephora, I come across to find out that Sephora did have smallest size of La Mer Cleansing foam for me to try out as first time user of La Mer Skincare product. I highly recommend it for those who first time user , you should buy a smallest size to try it out on your own skin before you go for biggest size of La Mer cleansing foam. To prevent what if you ain’t suitable for the facial cleansing foam then you will be upset about it and feel a waste of money .  Anyway I Highly Recommend this La mer Cleansing foam should suitable for all type of skin. You won’t be regret after you use this awesome cleansing foam .  I am going to get the biggest size of this awesome cleansing form as I love it so much . Once you use it on your face , you will find out your face eventually become tight and smooth after the you wash your face with this La Mer Cleansing Foam. Last but not least , for those babe who looking for awesome skincare , I highly recommend La Mer Skincare to those babe who don’t mind of the price as I know the price is quite pricey but as you know good skincare product sure be pricey that why make them look luxury and worth it . Alright , have a happy skin experience. Thank you 🙏🏻 😊😘😘😘"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Foam - 30ml,"Okay, so very reliable - I was purging, had sensitive and irritated skin, and this cleansed without stinging or making anything worse. It’s beautiful and smells a little soapy (it’s light though), but I’m kind of over spending so much money on a cleanser when there are comparable and cheaper options out there."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,good try,lovely cleanser. not drying and felt clean after each wash. minus a star for the hefty price. a good try if you want to feel pampered but other than that i think you can get other good cleanser at a cheaper price :)
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,good,"I have slightly sensitive combination-dry skin. This cleanser is very gentle and does it job well! It can generate quite thick foam but does not overly dry my skin. My skin feels smooth and clean after using it. Though the price is on the higher end, I purchased it when there was an offer, so still worth it!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,ms,"my favorite cleanser  all time. very mild and it 
makes my skin very soft, smooth.Thank you sephora delivery also fast! item also received with lovely condition ♥️ the best thing i purchase this and get free creme de la mer 7 ml for free because they had beauty campaign for la mer product september 2020. will repurchase again with sephora👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,3rd tube,"Been using this cleansing foam for many months. Really like it, Compared with skii I tried, I think this is good, but price is actually on the high side. "
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,LA MER,"nice used!!! And feel hydrated , clean , will buy once again !                                                                                       
"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Feels nourishing! ,"Bought this in the smaller size for easy on the go usage after workouts etc. It doesn’t feel dry at all, it also has a nice, luxurious texture and scent, and skin feels supple and clean after cleansing. I love it!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,simply the best,"Everything LaMer on my skin is heavenly. This face wash is my go to- it cleans, doesn’t dry out my skin but leaves it looking like porcelain. I have combination skin, that tends to get somewhat oily. It’s a splurge I just can’t go without!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Foam - 30ml,Safe your Monday ladies ! Cethaphil it’s cheaper and dermatologies recommended . Plus it will leave your skin softer and it don’t smell like Irish Spring soap!
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Foam - 30ml,"The other reviewers are correct--this cleanser does have a strong scent reminiscent of Irish Spring soap. However, it is fantastic for my oily skin and the most effective cleanser I've used in a long while. It gets all my makeup off and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. A little bit goes a long way, so even though I don't love the price tag, I think it's ultimately worth it. I just purchased my second bottle and think I'll be sticking with this for the foreseeable future."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Foam - 30ml,My only complaint is that it feels like it just washed my face with a bar of Irish spring bar soap or any other kind of bar soap afterwards.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,Still on the fence about this cleanser,"I love La Mer products. I have several of their items in my skincare routine. I thought I’d give this cleanser a try even though I think the cost is outrageous for a cleanser. I don’t mind spending money on serums and moisturizers but was weary about $95 price tag. But I needed to know if it’s a game changer.  I’ve only been using it for a week so not yet convinced it’s worth the cost. Pros: very creamy and not drying, nice La Mer scent,  foams up nicely, a lot of product as you don’t need much, and washes off well. Cons: Hefty price. I don’t dislike it but I don’t love it either. Just wondering if it really is that much better than other products I’ve tried and loved. I’ll enjoy using the rest of this cleanser but not convinced I’ll repurchase. I’d rather save the money for their other products. I wouldn’t deter people from purchasing it."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Foam - 30ml,"Great cleanser, especially for oily/combination skin in my opinion. Doesn't leave skin stripped."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,Gentle cleanser works for me!,I love this cleanser.  I use it each morning in the shower with a Mia brush.  The cleanser produces a gentle foam/lather and has a clean and fresh scent.  I am now 60 and have been using it for several years.  I am so glad that Sephora started carrying this brand!
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,Good Cleanser,"Provides good lathering, removes makeup and dirt and feels refreshing but if I had to wash twice to remove heavy makeup, it’s a bit drying
I’m going to give the gel cleanser a try"
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Canada,La Mer The Cleansing Foam - 30ml,Product is great. It foams well and cleanses nicely. This brand is just amazing at every product they produce. Never disappoints.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,Canada,La Mer The Cleansing Foam - 30ml,TOO oily- I got breakout everytime I wear it. I would not recommend it to oily skin type
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,I received the trial size eye concentrate.,I bought this mini because I wanted to try La Mer without spending so much. This cleanser does its job but is not anything special.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,Awesome cleanser but maybe not for super dry skin!,"Don’t get me wrong. I like this cleansing foam! It leaves my skin feeling VERY CLEAN!!! I’m sort of a clean freak, so I love just how cleansed my skin feels. :) It foams up quickly AND washes off very quickly. A TINY amount really goes a long, long, LONG way! I love that I also don’t need a lot. The scent is light and pleasant. I have sensitive skin, and this didn’t break me out. Unfortunately, I also have seriously dry skin that’s recovering from severe eczema, and this doesn’t leave my skin feeling as hydrated or comfortable after cleaning as I’d like. I would recommend The Cleansing Lotion or The Cleansing Oil, if you’re looking for something more hydrating."
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,5 stars ***** for the La Mer foaming cleanser,La Mer Foam cleanser is one of my favorite splurges!  It not only cleans extremely well  (and foams easily) but it smells clean - like a typical La Mer product.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,Nothing special,I love La mer! But I must say there is nothing special about this foam! At least for me. I am giving 3 starts because I truly love the brand.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,Cheap Soap Vibes,Wanted to love this but it feels like washing your face with soap. I’ve got combination skin and this made my face feel so tight and horrible! Please don’t waste your money! There’s so many gorgeous cleansers out there for half (or less!) this price.
LA MER-The Cleansing Foam,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Foam - 30ml,"This is my go-to cleanser. I enjoy the light fragrance and it leaves my face clean and refreshed. I knocked it down a star for being somewhat drying.  I only use this a few times a week, and only a pea-size amount.  The rest of the week I cleanse with the La Mer Micellar cleansing water. 

I read another reviewer who commented on the instruction to avoid the eyes. As I understand La Mer reps only recommend products specifically formulated for the eye area to be used around the eyes period. Which in this regiment is the Micellar water for cleansing."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,don’t like the smell,It has a very synthetic or rather expired smell. A mild enough cleanser for my sensitive skin. Didn’t cause irritation. Wasn’t vowed by it though. No difference from other cleanser. 
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,good,a gentle cleanser with a nice scent. it doesn't foam up so you may not like it if you are used to foaming cleansers. the skin doesn't feel too stripped after using. suitable for dry skin. 
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,Trusty Cleanser!,"This cleanser is gel-like and do not lather. Feels gentle on the skin, the smell is calming and refreshing. This is a repeated purchase. For the price, it’s worth it as a bottle last a long time!"
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,just so-so,"lather/foam free and very gentle and not drying. personally, im not sure it does the job in proper cleansing the face to other cleansers, so ive put it to my morning routine where i dont need to clear makeup and residue from the day but i feel like it doesnt do much. also has a light scent, which i dont prefer in my skincare."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,cleansing gel,"Got this during the sales n its an alright cleanser. Nothing to shout about. Just becareful not to let the product gets into your eyes, it really stings
"

MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel - 236ml,Not sure my make up cleaned up. Very not refreshing feeling. Want to wash again with other cleanser.
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,Ms,This is such a value for money for such big bottle. Bought it during 50% sale. It gives off a very nice and light fragrance that is pleasant. The only downside is that it doesn’t foam and it feels ‘slimy’. 
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Philippines,MB,"This is a great cleanser. In  fact, I have already repurchased a bigger bottle"
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Okay cleansing gel,I have sensitive skin type and this is okay cleansing gel to clean my face in morning routine without irritating my skin . Overall is a okay cleansing gel . Its worth to purchase for its reasonable price with big amount of product.

MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,Ms,This product takes away all the oil and dirt. It also leaves my skin feeling moist and not feeling dry. It has a very light/minimal scent. Good for acne and sensitive skin. 
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel - 236ml,Burns my eyes and doesn’t remove makeup.  I want to like this brand but I just don’t.
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Brunei,This and the Cucumber lotion,"They're to be used together in order to see result. Love the cleanser, it strips oil from the face without leaving it too dry. "

"
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,nice scent and great cleansing power ,Suitable for use during pregnancy. Nice fresh scent and great cleansing power. Did not feel like it is too harsh for my skin nor is it too dry after cleansing. 
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Too strongly fragranced,I didn’t really like this cleanser my skin is sensitive and acne prone and the fragrance was over powering I gave it to my friend.
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Not for me,I was really excited to use this but sadly it did nothing for me. I did like the consistency and feel of the product but I had zero results.
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel - 236ml,Ew. This smells terrible and BURNS if you get it anywhere near your eyes. My skin didn’t feel clean after using it.
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Breaks me out :(,"I've had this for a while, and i've noticed whenever I come back to this cleanser I get bumps. 
Also, the smell takes some getting used to. And it did do its job of a basic clean.
Now I've repurposed it as a hand soap."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,lo being my skinnn,If love had a face it would be this toner I love it so much it’s sooo goood for all skin types I have used it for 3 months and now I am about to buy it again the results are so happpppplyyyyyyt
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel - 236ml,"I use this cleanser whenever my normal/combination skin is acting oily. It rids my skin of excess oil and gunk without over-stripping or my skin feeling tight. Lightly exfoliating, leaves skin bright."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Wishy Washy....Now Just Throwing It Away,"My mother had gifted me this cleanser and I decide to use it. In the beginning it reduce some of my pimples and help a bit with my acne scars however after a few more uses more pimples began to appear then to go away. Finally after a month of using this product I began to notice my forehead which never had any acne began to have a cluster of pimples/whiteheads. Once i stop using it, my forehead acne cleared up. I will be using my go to product from now on."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,cleans well and smells great,"this smells incredible and leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped. it doesn't foam up but it still works and is very gentle. since this also exfoliates the skin, I use it every other day or so. my skin has never been so glowing and smooth!"
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel - 236ml,"so good - it’s so gentle and is by far the least stripping facewash I own. I used to use the Kiehls daily clay wash, but compared to thus one it strips my face and leaves it feeling so dry. don’t be put off by the fact that it doesn’t foam as much, it just has less surfactants"
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,mild and clean,"Smells really clean and fresh, surprisingly mild to my skin although I don’t feel like it’s really cleaning my skin, but my skin is super clean after this "
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,Love the cleansing gel,Love this item. Tried this product in a travel size and it felt amazing on my skin. No stripping feeling after wash and skin feels clean and hydrated. 
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,not for me ,this is the only product from mario that i do not have compliments for. i have hear of a lot of good reviews but it is definitely not for me. it felt soap free and difficult to wash off in my opinion and i stop using it after once or twice.
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,VERY GENTLE,"A very very very gentle cleansing gel, sometimes I even wonder if it really clean my face. I think this could be more suitable for sensitive skin? I’m not sure, but I won’t buy it again."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Great cleansing gel,"This is the first time that I'm trying out this brand, love this cleansing gel! I've sensitive skin condition, but after using it my skin wouldn't feel dry / oily / itchy / redness and it's foamless gel, and will purchase again soon! Worth a try and it smells abit like baby's shampoo.  And it's not expensive as other brands. "
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,loveee,"This is the third bottle and i bought a big one for more convenience………I use this about 3 times a day and my skin doesn’t feel dry at all ( i go out quite often so whenever i got home, i cleanse my face with this cleanser). I like the smell too. Can’t find any other better option for my dry skin. "
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,my most favorite cleanser for dry skin,"I love this cleanser so much, it is so gentle on my dry skin, my skin feels clean but not that tight feeling after cleansing, it is like a budget version of the Fresh soy cleanser in my opinion. Although it has a strong fresh scent and some people might dislike it, it is ok for me, i kind of like it to be precise. Highly recommended for dry skin. "
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,3rd purchase,"This is a simple cleanser - in a good way. It is not too harsh for my skin. It is not foaming - just how I like it. It almost has like a creamy consistency. Because of its gentle exfoliating property, it helps keep my skin soft. I use this only at night - especially when I wear heavy makeup throughout the day. "
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,My fav cleanser,Gentle on skin and effective in clarifying 
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,my skin loves it!,"I've gone through 2 big bottles of this. I love that it is not foamy, and the gel simply glides on my face as I massage. After I rinse off, my face feels soft and moist, unlike many of those foaming cleansers that feels so drying. As this gel cleanser also contains exfoliating enzymes, I feel that my pores is clear of blackheads after prolong daily use, AM and PM.  I barely have any breakouts when I'm using this. I've tried using some other cleansers after finishing this and I noticed myself started breaking out again. I'm definitely coming back to this! "
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Didnt really get the consistency that I was expecting on the product. I couldnt comment if there was any changes that happen to my face but I felt that its not worth it for dry skin.
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,Mario Badescu Enzyme Gel,A great option for every day. I use in the  morning and in the evening. Very good product Mario Badescu Enzyme cleansing gel. Love it Mario Badescu product!!!
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,Ms,"I have buy it because of having sensitive face. After using of it, nothing different compare to other product . Recommend if it is for normal cleaning and washing of face. "
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,must try,I know about this cleansing gel from a friend. after first time trial I had to buy one for for me immediately. it make your skin feel very soft and clean. love it
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Doesn’t clean my face at all!!!!,I didn’t like this product at all!!!! It’s not able to properly clean my slightly oily face!!!! After using this my face still feels dirty!!!! Every time I have to clean my face with something else after using this gel! I don’t know who is this cleansing gel made for!!!!
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,meh ,"brought this for my sister. and according to her, it didn't do much for her skin. it caused her skin to breakout and not worth the price. the scent is good tho"
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Nice.,"Love the smell, love the gentleness.  Great it you have flaky skin.  Leaves a clean feeling, no residue."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,non drying cleanser,"this is gentle cleanser with no foam. my skin is usually sensitive to new products and may have a period of adaption with small whitish bumps. however, there isnt any with this product. "
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia, Best cleansing gel,"This is one of the most gentle cleansers I’ve used. It works fine with my sensitive skin, which is currently recuperating from acnes. It has no foam, mild but gorgeous texture. It has a nice smell with smooth application. I eventually bought the biggest size for the price, which was more affordable and worth it to compare to the slightly small packaging.  "
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Made me breakout :(,This product made me breakout a ton ! i have naturally pretty clear skin (witch I am very thankful for) but after 2 weeks of use I started seeing a lot of breakouts. After I saw those breakouts I stopped using it and my skin cleared up great !  ( keep in mind this product has fragrance and some alcohol witch is really not ideal for the skin because it strips your natural oils away )
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel - 236ml,"Loved product after initial use , face was noticeably brighter, then after a week of use my skin broke out. I have eczema and this products doesn’t appear to be sensitive skin friendly."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,Not for me,"This wasn’t for me - made me break out slightly, I think because of the fragrance in there I have slightly sensitive skin so it just didn’t agree with my skin. "
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,ms,Within a year $6 increase in product when usd is Low now?? Is that why your discount of 15 and 20% discount is for? 🙄....:............................
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Bought this to try out the cleanser. It’s a cleansing gel so it won’t foam a lot. Suitable for my sensitive skin as I didn’t have any breakouts after using it. Smells nice and price is affordable too. 
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,enzyme cleansing gel,Nice smell doesn’t irritate and not drying                                                                                                                
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,enzyme cleansing gel,Nice smell doesn’t irritate and not drying                                                                                                                                 
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,Best cleanser,This is the best cleanser I ever used! I love the smell and how affordable this is. This never breaks me out and I really like the gel texture of this face wash as compared to other brands.
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,okay,"so-so.

I don't only use this to remove make up, but if i have missed some spot, it does the job. i use this alternately with my eucerin acne gel wash. so far no harsh reaction.. but im not sure how it helps improve my skin. 

i usually have red bumps from face masks-this does not do anything to help. most likely will not repurchase. you get good amount for the money though!"
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Very basic,"It hasn't done much to my skin. It is a basic cleanser to clean your face, as good as soap. Not worth even $14 ."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Definitely recommend!,I have sensitive skin that is prone to cystic acne and this product is gentle and smells great. I use it daily before bed and have paired it with a toner and moisturizer; my skin feels soft and clean after use.
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,good for all skin type ,It didn't react to my dry and sensitive skin. Firstly I was surprised on the texture. It's a thick jelly like but a bit greasy at the same time. But it does the job perfectly without drying the skin. Just loving it. I been using for 3 months now. 
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,No Thanks,"I got this cleanser as a gift. Used this cleanser about 4-5 times max. The very last tome I used it, it broke me out all over my cheeks they were itchy and red with little bumps everywhere. I’m pretty sure it’s the parfum (fragrance) that broke me out because the smell is so strong. Also I don’t like that it doesn’t foam up when washing... it makes me feel like my face isn’t getting clean."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,perfect ,"My skin is clear after I use this cleanser. I’ve purchased my 2nd bottle. Still on my first bottle, though. Love the texture, smell, colour, everything about this cleanser. Highly recommended! "
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,really suits my skin,Definitely suits my skin almost perfectly. the price tag won't kill you and most importantly it's 100% vegan! Don't really produce any bubble when you you use it but leaves your skin clean.
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Good product ,I’ve been using it for 3 months and it’s make my skin become more smoother than before. it’s also works to faded my pimples scar. i been using it every morning and during night I used acne that contains salicylic acid. 
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,easy cleaning,"purchase this to have an easy, no fuss facial cleanser for my mornings.nice product to use, smells not bad and face felt clean.works as described.good size too!"
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Nice,Try it only for a few days not seeing any difference for now. Smell like rose and the texture feels like lotion if you put too much you can see it's white texture. Make my skin hydrated as it claim but not for the whole day. Can say it affordable with the price
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Gentle Wash,"This product is a gentle cleanser for people with sensitive skin like mine. My skin is also dry and gets flaky with normal face wash. The texture of the gel is creamy like so if you do not like a cleansing gel that does not foam,  this product is not for you. "
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Decent cleanser and does the job,"I like the price point for this cleanser for how much you get. It does a good job taking off my face makeup but does struggle with removing mascara. Unfortunately, this is not gentle for the eyes as it does sting. This cleanser leaves my face feeling clean and does not dry out my face. Instead of applying it to a wet face, I prefer to apply it dry. When it is applied wet I feel like the cleanser slips and 'washes' too easily, so I will wash my face after massaging and lathering the cleanser onto my dry face."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel - 236ml,I don't know for whom that product works but for me it was just wasted money. Makes skin dry and after using skin feels absolutely unclean.
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel - 236ml,I really like this cleanser. It doesn’t make my skin feel dry and my face feels very clean after I use it. Overall I will definitely continue to use this product :)
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,Favorite Cleanser,I’ve been using this cleanser for many years. My skin feels nice and soft after using the cleanser and it doesn’t cause any breakouts. Love this product and will keep repurchasing. 
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,love!,love the fresh and clean feeling everytime after i cleanse with this. but i take more time to wash off the product. been using it for a week now. will repurchase.
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Instant brightening result,The enzyme cleansing gel is a cheaper option of the Allies of Skin Fresh Slate Vitamin C and Enzyme Brightening Cleanser and Mask. I have tried both brand and both gives equally instant brightening result. Will repurchase this again
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel - 236ml,"My favorite cleanser. My skin feels fresh and smooth after using it. It does not dry your skin. A dime sized amount is all you need, so the bottle lasts awhile. I do have to use an exfoliating cleanser in my rotation because this product does not exfoliate."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,changed my view on facial soaps and foams.,great cleansing gel. now that ive used a gel rather than foam or soap im loving it. it gets all the makeup off my face wo harsh stripping ingredients like most face soap. it's also great smelling and easy to rinse off.
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Really satiesfied with their product ,"Just like all the other products from Mario 
Badescu, this one also comes in a simple looking plastic bottle with a white sticker label. Overall, this works quite well, especially for sensitive skin, as a basic daily cleanser, and is extremely soothing.
"
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Very creamy,"I like this, it's got a very creamy gel like texture to the wash. I thought at the beginning it did nothing, but you need to keep it on for 2 mins. And then in circular movement rub it again before you wash it off. works well for my oily/combination skin"
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,BEST CLEANSER HANDS DOWN!,My favorite everyday cleanser. yes it does not lather but it doesnt bother me. after years of buying super expenive products or something too harsh i found my match. gentle cleanser that gets the job done! 2nd time purchasing ... also it last forever!  use this 1-2 times a day and ive had the same bottle for 9-10 months so worth it!
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Great milk cleanser!,"I use this cleanser twice a day and I love it! I use it after I remove my makeup w a wipe at night and it really gives a nice deep clean without stripping or irritating my dry skin. My favorite part is the texture of this cleanser, it's milky but almost feels like an oil when emulsified on the skin. I will continue buying!"
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Helps with oil on my t-zone,I've tried loads of combination skin cleanser that claims to help reduce oil and acne and not much worked. But this product is magic for me. Never gonna change after this
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Non lather smells good but disappointing,"I have oily combination skin. I gave a month’s period of usage before reviewing so my review would make more sense. Besides cleaning, it doesn’t really do anything extra to my face. I even have acnes and blackheads developed that I had to use extra exfoliator. I prefer MB acne facial cleanser instead. Only happy because the price is reasonable and the content is value for money. Will not repurchase."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel - 236ml,My go to cleanser! This product has never failed me! If i try other skin care products and if it gives my acne this is my immediate product I fall back on. It’ll immediately clear my skin! Con- it can sometimes dry out my skin right after so I recommend using a moisturizer after
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Mediocre,"It's an affordable cleanser that cleanse the face gently; so does any other gel cleanser tho.

It's a very mediocre cleanser. If you having oily or acne prone skin, just get a cleanser with salicylic acid. The Inkey List has a very good one but it's always out of stock.

Also, it doesnt do what it claims."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel - 236ml,I use this every morning as a gentle cleanser when my face is not dirty and it’s really great. It smells so good and is a nice wake me up in the morning. I love that it doesn’t lather.
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Singapore,awesome,I have been using this in the mornings to cleanse my face thoroughly before applying any skincare. It feels clean and I like the idea of using enzymes in a cleanser! 
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,It's alright,"The first time I used this it caused redness and I broke out. My friend told me to let my skin get used to it, so I continued using. You need to spend a few seconds more to wash off this cleansing gel, and it leaves your skin feeling soft after washing. Since it's a gel cleanser it doesn't foam and doesn't feel clean, but I guess that's normal. After using it for a while it doesn't feel like it does anything for me. It's also a big bottle so it wasn't to expensive by comparison. I am concerned on the harmful ingredients used. Overall, I doubt I would buy it again. "
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,go-to facial cleanser,"This is my favorite facial cleanser. Non-drying and keeps all blemishes at bay. It’s a gel so it’s not meant to lather as some other reviewers have complained about. But I have oily skin and it works perfectly for keeping my skin clean and balanced. Even got my boyfriend to start using it and his skin is clearer than ever. Plus it’s so affordable and a single bottle lasts forever, even using twice a day. This is one product I always keep on-hand."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Mario Badescu,This is my first time using this Mario Badescu: Enzyme Cleansing Gel. Hopefully this product gives the best results to my skin. My skin type is combination.
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,skin not dry,At first im skeptical because no foam. I feel like i just massaging some kind of oil in gel form on mt face and neck. But the moment i rinse it i know my skin is clean and still feel soft and plump. Definitely will repeat again
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel - 236ml,"It was a weird product.  It didn’t lather in any way, felt it left a film on my skin, my never felt clean after using it and I always felt like I needed to recleanse.  It was heavy and thick.  A total fail for me.  I wouldn’t buy this again."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Holygrail face wash!!!,"I have tried every face wash from Cerave to Drunk Elephant and have yet to find one that doesn’t irritate my skin and isn’t super expensive... and then I found this one!!! This face wash is SUPER gentle and light but also gets the job done. 

I have yet to try using it to wash off makeup as I use makeup remover before washing my face, but if you have sensitive skin and take your makeup off beforehand, then this cleaner is for you!!!"
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,,Feels so clean,"Amazing cleanser that leaves your skin/face feeling ultra-clean, doesn't lather up like other cleansers but still feels like its getting the job done and more. Smells amazing too, not over-powering."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,,"Magic, heaven! ",This gel is very effectively exfoliate my acne prone skin. It melts into oil as I massage it on my face and neck. Gentle for everyday use. I also use for my back and shoulder. It cleanses my overnight drying lotion paint on my face very well! This won't make my skin dry. The smell is strong but who cares. I love it! 
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Gentle but uber effective!,"Why am I just now finding this wonderful product?! It is ever so gentle on my skin, and I am currently using prescription Tretinion (generic Retin A) to treat congested pores and, of course my fine lines and wrinkles. It really has helped with the texture problems, like flakiness and dry patches that come with using retiniods, and I have had zero irritation on my sensitive skin. I love how it makes my face feel baby smooth. I will never be without this stuff again!"
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,,Smells like Grandma :( ,"I reallly wanted to like this, but the smell reminds me horribly of my grandmother's face cream. The creamy texture doesn't seem to wash off too well under water, and somehow makes my skin feel squeaky/dry and clogged. Maybe on someone else this works better, but this was a no for me - still have the entire bottle in my shower :( "
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,,Can’t Live Without This,"This is my 8th bottle. I have used this since 2 years ago and this is the only cleanser that does not break me out and gives me acne! Very gentle and clean, REALLY cleans everything! It’s stingy on the eyes but then again I never use eye makeup so its perfect for me"
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel - 236ml,"It was calming on the skin but it didn’t seem like a cleanser, it just absorbed into my skin and didn’t clean anything. Was strange."
MARIO BADESCU-Enzyme Cleansing Gel,USA,Really good!,This is a great cleansing gel. It cleans my skin very well and leaves my skin feeling so soft.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,good,"it's a gentle cleanser with not much fragrance, i like it! bought the smaller bottle to try it out first and i'm going to buy the full sized for sure. hopefully they restock the bigger sized bottle with the pump :-)"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Will not recommend,"I used to have flawless face skin and able to use any brand of cleanser, be it drugstore or high end brand. But this Philosophy cleanser is really useless, not able to throughly clean dirt/oil, it caused irritation and made my skin condition very bad now. At first I thought it was taking some time to perfect, keep on using it for few months. Nope, it’s just bad. Useless product."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,nice smell one step make up remover,I do not think it suitable to all oily skin. The another transparent type of philosophy facial wash is better for oily skin. But this one works like make-up remover so i use when i lazy.It have a nice healing smell. 
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Highly recommended ,My go-to daily makeup remover. It helps to cleanse the skin from dirt and makeup without drying the skin. Highly recommended for all especially heavy makeup users to get one for themselves.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Not for me,I bought this to try out and see if it suits my daily facial steps. I find this a little bit oily and hard to wash off for some reason… I’m not sure but I think this is not for me. 
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Best cleanser ,"My always go to cleanser. Philosophy's Purity Oil-Free Cleanser is a super viscous gel that you need to work a bit until you finally get some foam, but once it gets going, it leaves you with a dense lather that you can feel working as you rub it into your skin. You really don’t need to use a lot, so the standard eight ounce bottle should last ages. "
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Must have cleanser ,"The best cleanser and highly recommended. Philosophy's Purity Oil-Free Cleanser is a super viscous gel that you need to work a bit until you finally get some foam, but once it gets going, it leaves you with a dense lather that you can feel working as you rub it into your skin. You really don’t need to use a lot, so the standard eight ounce bottle should last ages. "
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Slight formula change- still works great,I have been using this product for 5+ years. On my most recent bottle I noticed the smell had changed so I compared my old bottle and some of the ingredients sequence have changed. I find now my skin is a bit tighter after washing my face. Nothing crazy but it's annoying it changed on me.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,"Simple, do the job!","Overall it's a decent face wash.
The smell is refreshing, skin feels soft after wash, it also seems to wash off makeup. 
Price is good considering the big size. 
If you wants something simple and get the job done, this is it."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Holygrail facial cleanser,"I’ve been using this for YEARS. The thing about it though, is that i realise when I’ve used it for awhile, my skin will reach a sort of plateau. Almost like it’s gotten used to its effects and would need a different product to spice it up. Other than that, I always return to this cleanser and love that there is a pump version so that i can dispense it easily in the toilet.

Doesn’t leave your skin feeling too tight or stripped, but at the same time dont expect this to wash all your heavy makeup away. Washes light makeup away just fine. But if you’re talking waterproof mascara and the works, just make sure you use a makeup remover before washing your face lest you’ll be disappointed to see that there are streaks of makeup left on your face after washing."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,I have used this product for a few years. I’ve tried others but keep coming back to it. It’s gentle and easily washes off eye makeup. Definitely a holy grail item.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Australia,Love this cleanser,"Another philosophy product I just can't fault, it does the job, smells great and is far more affordable than others I've tried and returns the same results as highend skincare. My skin is left feeling soft, smooth and incredibly clean, highly recommend!"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Obsessed!,This cleanser is amazing on my oily skin. It leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped. It has a (slight) nice smell to it. I’ve used this cleanser for years and never had problems. Definitely worth the money

PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,great,"good cleanser for my dry skin.  I feel that it can remove most of my makeup, double cleanse required.  I'm using this for no makeup cleansing, still prefer my shu uemura oil."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,awesome,"using this cleanser for few months now. i have realised my skin is better, not dry after wash, even i can open my eyes when washing my face. i can feel my skin is clean even i dont double cleanse. will buy small size for travelling."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Really effective as a cleanser,I’m not sure this works as a makeup remover that effectively (does not remove waterproof eye makeup) but it works great as a cleanser for my combination skin. Does not dry it out and I do feel my breakouts go away quicker with the use of this paired with some acne patches. 
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,my favorite cleanser!,I’ve tried many cleansers but I always go back to this one. I’ve been using this for ~2 years now along with the moisturizer. It’s very good for sensitive skin like mine; very mild but can also remove light makeup!
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Not suitable for my skin,im not sure what to say about this product as it didnt work on my skin. im still hunting to find a good cleanser that will be able to help clear out my impurities and acnes and whiteheads:(
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Simple and effective,This is my 3rd bottle. It cleans my face without stripping off the moisture. I have really oily skin and this helps a lot in cleaning my pores. I will definitely be  buying again
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,Love the gentleness of the product. Don’t think it’s a great makeup remover on its own but works well when combined with other products.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,quite nice to use ,"First time trying this product. Got it on one for one sale. Not much smell, doesn't cause the face to be very dry and yet I feel clean. Not sure about it removing my makeup cause I double cleanse. "
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,good cleanser ,"Have been using it for many years. it is all purpose, cleans well but does not give u the astringent feel. the face feels supple after washing, not tight. "
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Mrs,Simple facial cleanser.. being using it for nearly 6 months and it doesn’t dry out my skin. On my second bottle for now and im still going back to the same cleaners 
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Why did it take me so long to try!,Wow! Have only been using this for about a month and I just love how it melts away makeup (even waterproof mascara) and leaves my skin feeling fresh but not stripped. I am on accutane which means my skin is dry and irritated this cleanser does nothing but help those concerns!
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Love it!,"Been using this facial wash for a long time, it doesn’t feel dry after wash. My family been using it too and they love it. 100% recommend to anyone with oily skin!"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,value for money,Bought this during sales and this always out of stock if you are not fast enough. Been using this and think it’s value for money for such a big bottle. It wont dry out my skin. Not for those who prefer foamy cleanser. This has no foam at all but it cleansed ur skin for mild make up.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Worth it,"I finally got to try this cleanser and I am impressed. The texture is nice and it smells like freshness with a hint of herbs. I only use up to a pea-sized portion every time and it sure goes a long way. I generally only apply eyeliner and mascara to my face so this cleanser takes it all off gently along with any oils and dirt my face accumulated during the day. It doesn’t dry out my skin like a couple other cleansers I’ve tried but I still apply moisturizer as good practice. Overall, very happy with this purchase and certainly worth the investment."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Works for me,"This products works well for my skin, I have dry, acnce prone skin. I have notice a big difference since using it. At the moment my skin is clear and I love it. I have been buying over again ever since."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,holy grail,"The holy grail of skin cleansing. Hands down the best I’ve used with acne prone, sensitive skin"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,smell so luxurious ,"First time buying and trying this brand. It was going on a promo of buy 1 get 1, so I decided to try. Smell nice and luxurious. Glad that it doesn’t leave the skin feeling tight after washing. That’s the only worry when trying out new cleanser."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,My holy grail cleanser,"I've been using this cleanser for 7 years now, I have combination skin and growing up in a country where the climate is (super) humid, this does not make me oily at all. It keeps my face balanced with the moisture I need (doesn't dry me out too). It just works well for me."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,The best,"This is my favourite skin cleanser. I have used it for years and it makes my skin glow! It doesn’t have too strong of a smell, nor does it leave your skin dry after using. I would definitely recommend even for sensitive skin."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,"fuss free cleanser, downside on the cap","Been great so far, will definitely repurchase it as it works really well for my combi/dry/oily skin. Though it feels abit drying at times, it doesn’t cause any major breakouts etc"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,decent cleanser,This is a nice size bottle and good overall cleanser. I really think there are better ones on the market though. It does a good job of getting makeup off and not causing breakouts but also burns the eyes.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,"I have been using this cleanser for close to 10 years. I have recommended to many friends who also use religiously. I get many compliments when I leave the house after just using it, even with no makeup. It’s gentle on my sensitive skin and would recommend to anyone!"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,"I love this cleanser, been using it for over 7 years! It takes off makeup and dirt without leaving residue on my skin or drying it out."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,AMAZING!!!,Good for dry skin. Doesn’t make it greasy. Cleans and moisturizes. Smells sooooo good!
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Purity Facial Cleanser,"Used it once on my face and never again because of the strong scent. I didnt want it to go to waste so I used it as a shower gel instead! As a body wash, it is hydrating enough and it makes you smell like you just left the spa. "
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,facial cleanser ,it’s just a nice basic facial cleanser that doesn’t feel like it will rip the natural oil off your face. suitable for people with normal to sensitive skin. bought the large size that will probably last me the whole year
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Great cleanser!,Leaves your face feeling ultra soft and smooth. I use this together with Bobbi Brown’s cleansing oil and they compliment each other pretty well. Skin feels hydrated and doesn’t feel tight after each wash. 
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,"I always end up coming back to this face wash. It’s gentle enough to use on my eyes to remove makeup, and also leaves my skin feeling soft and NEVER dry like so many face washes. I also have very sensitive skin with patches of eczema around my face and it’s never left feeling irritated with this face wash."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Best cleanser!,"I have been using this cleanser for years! As my skin is sensitive, so it's difficult to find a suitable cleanser that is not harsh on the skin. I can finally say I have found my best cleanser!"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Holy grail for dry gal!,Love love love this product. It makes my face feel so clean and fresh but doesn’t make me dry!! I’ve tried so many cleansers and nothing feels as silky and clean as this one. Highly recommend for people w dry skin. I broke out before I received the product and after a few days use my breakout is already going down!
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,My new fav.,"I actually look forward to washing my face whenever I use this cleanser because it feels like quality. I love the way it smells, the texture is a perfect gel-like consistency, it doesn't strip moisture from your skin, and is all-round very effective based on the ingredients."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,"Great for others, but not for me:(","This product is doesn’t dry out your skin and definitely keeps you hydrated but unfortunately it gave me bad cystic acne every time I used it. I tried it multiple different times to make sure it wasn’t a one time thing or caused by something different, but sadly each time I would break out:("
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,great,"Very gentle cleanser with a light scent. The bottle lasted me a year. Not the best for makeup removal, really better used as a second step cleanser to get off whatever the first face wash missed."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,the best cleanser ever ,"This is my go to cleanser. I have gone through bottles of this and I will always go back to this one. Firstly it is affordable and secondly my skin feels clean. When I don't have full face make up, just concealer and eyebrows, (cos sometimes I am too lazy to double cleanse) I trust that this can do its job in cleaning my skin if u get what I mean. "
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,Nothing Special but Still Like,"It’s a great everyday cleanser. It does it’s job like most cleansers on the market do. But is it all that special and worth the price? Eh, that’s  debatable. 

PROS:
- Paraben And Sulfate Free
- Gentle. Doesn’t irritate my skin 
- Cleans pores and removes remaining makeup after oil cleanse  
- Skin feels clean and refreshed after use 
- Soothes my skin 
- Light scent but not overpowering 
- Little goes a long way. While it might be a bit on the pricey side the bottle lasts a long time

CONS:
- Don’t find it to be hydrating 
- Had issues with the pump breaking and the pump basically stops working when you get towards the end of your bottle. You have to take pump off for the last few uses. 
- Have been a couple times where it left my face “squeaky” clean but that could be do to oil cleanse (trying new cleansing oil now)"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,Love this product!,"Love love love this product! When I cleanse my face, I use this to dissolve my make up. It is wonderful, and melts off even the heaviest most waterproof mascara as well as waterproof liner. Massage it in then rinse it off your face. I follow with a foaming cleanser to complete my double cleansing regimen. This product does not irritate my skin and is not drying. At first I wasn’t sure about it because it did not lather like all the other cleansers I’ve ever used, but the way it melted away any make up/concealer/primer sold me after the first use.  Please don’t ever stop making it!"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,Got my first bottle as a gift and this was the cleanser ive been looking for! It leaves my skin smooth and not oily at all. Its difficult for me to use other cleansers since i dont really see the results i was looking for. But this one though made all the difference. I use it day and night and sometimes switches to the micro facial one at some nights.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,All time favourite ,"Very gentle. You just need a small size of the cleanser to wash off the dirts away. Took me almost a year to finish a whole bottle of 472ml, with 2 times daily wash. "
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,ehhhh,"This is a cleanser that will either work for your skin or it just doesn’t. It has questionable ingredients and isn’t entirely fragrance free, but they supposedly did a reformulation and removed the parabens. My tried and true cleanser is the soy face cleanser by Fresh but I decided to try this out to see if I would like it and have it as a backup. For one thing, this does not remove all of my makeup. I am able to either use my banila co balm or my garnier micellar water to remove my makeup first or just go straight in with the soy face cleanser and it removes EVERYTHING within one cleanse. With this cleanser, I HAVE to use a cleansing balm or micellar water first to remove my makeup because this cleanser will not remove it all if I don’t double cleanse. It also caused me to break out in two different places on my face. My skin is typically under control when it turns to breakouts but my skin definitely didn’t agree with something in this. I didn’t get the little small pimples that others who commented have gotten. I instead started getting big painful whiteheads, which typically happens when a product does not agree with my skin. If you don’t have acne-prone skin and don’t wear heavy makeup, you’ll love this. Otherwise, I’m going back to my soy face cleanser. It doesn’t break me out and removes my makeup thoroughly."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,best cleanser,"I've used many many cleansers and this one was the best - does its job of cleaning your face without stripping. if you only have mild make-up on, you won't even need to use makeup remover since this is supposed to multitask."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,a little pricey,"I have always been using this cleanser, it helps to cleanse my oily skin well without drying my skin after every wash. But this new version is more expensive than the old one, hence taking away 1 star as I felt the price is getting steeper. "
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,my fav cleanser,Great to see this finally restocked. This cleanser leaves my skin moisturised unlike other brands. Removes light make up well too but not mascara. It’s not foamy at all so you might not be used to it in the beginning 
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Don’t need anything else for my face,"Excellent, simple and gentle with my skin, to-go product for a daily clean skin"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,It didn’t make me break out. Also it is a gentle cleanser and you can use it twice a day!
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,This is a great face wash! It’s def not one of my all time favs but it gets the job done. I takes off my makeup nicely and it doesn’t sting my eyes which is a great bonus for me. Only giving it 4 stars because my skin did feel a little dry after washing if I didn’t follow up with a moisturizer right away. But I think this would be great for a lot of different skin types.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Ms,"Good product, skin feels clean and fresh after washing. It is effective in removing make up and cleaning skin with just one wash. However skin does feel a bit warm while washing with the product so over rubbing might not be a good idea."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,"On my 5th bottle! This stuff lasts incredibly long all you need is a tiny bit and it goes a long way. If you have sensitive, acne prone skin and looking for a good cleanser that doesn’t strip your skin, look no further"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,Love this cleanser! Honestly the price is amazing for how long this bottle lasts. Takes makeup off pretty well. Overall really impressed
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,Loved this face wash and I have bought few times but when I bought the big one … it burns my eyes which I don’t like won’t be buying again.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,"I’ve try so many cleanser! This is one of the best, worth it."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,"I'm really liking this cleanser so far, I just switched to it for my summer cleanser and so far it hasn't dried out my dry, sensitive skin and the scent is nice, I'm surprised that I'm not allergic to the fragrance. It removes all my makeup off my face and makes my face soft!"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,"Just buy it, you won’t regret it!","I have been using this for years! I won’t use any other cleanser. I did acutane a few years ago (I had severe acne) which drastically changed my skin and I now have EXTREMELY dry and sensitive skin, this is so incredibly gentle, does not dry out my skin at all and takes off every ounce of makeup. I don’t even use make up wipes before hand anymore because I realized a while ago I didn’t need to. I always double cleanse and have for as long as I can remember but would always need to remove my make up in some way first and then cleanse. This stuff I just wash twice and I’m done. I’m 33 and it’s truly the best cleanser I’ve ever used."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,amazing omg,"This is the best cleanser I have ever tried. I switched to  a different cleanser or stopped using one all together and I could see a physical difference in my skin. I can’t explain it, this cleanser just seems to calm my skin down and soothe it overall. If you use it with a makeup remover balm it’s perfect for makeup removal. I can’t recommend this cleanser enough.. especially if you have very sensitive skin!"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,not a fan,"i dont know if it anything for my skin , there are better ones out there."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,Spotless Skin & Sensitive-Friendly!,"I have really, really sensitive combination skin. My skincare routine isn’t super intensive, but figuring it out has been a lengthy, expensive, sting-y process. This face wash goes super easy on me though—it doesn’t dry me out, or leave me feeling like I haven’t done anything at all. It’s super refreshing, and most importantly it has left my skin SPOTLESS. As long as I keep on top of my routine, just washing and moisturizing twice a day, my skin stays smooth and acne clear. This cleanser is seriously worth a try. If you’re on the fence about it, get a smaller size and give it a go!"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,pleased!,"Cleans without leaving a residue-tackled even the longest-wearing, water proof makeup and left my face feeling fresh and clean! Thank you @influenster for sending it to me-I will def be willing to purchase in the future!"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,my skin has never been so clear! my skin is super dry and sensitive and this was very gentle on my face.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,"I really like this cleanser, I dont really think its anything special but it does the job and I like the way my skin feels after. It does have a fragrance, but it's not over powering and it doesn't linger. I always buy the larger size and it lasts me forever and it's a great price. It's very gentle on the skin and never leaves me feeling dry or stripped. It cleanses very well and removes any residual makeup after I double cleanse. A huge downside for me is the pump, when you start nearing the end of this cleanser like the final inch or two you need to remove the pump and pour it out, I've also had issues with the pump breaking on some of the bottles I've had. For the price of this cleanser that shouldn't be a problem. It is a standard cleanser and I do enjoy it but it's not life-changing."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,Great product,I received this (actually I got the one with spirulina extract) as a free sample from influenster (voxbox) and I absolutely love it. My skin feels great after definitely would recommend. Thank you Sephora and influenster!!! This will be my new cleanser for sure.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,great for the face!!,I usually don’t use products by Philosophy but since using this daily my face feels so much softer and it literally feels refreshed and squeaky clean which I don’t usually have that feeling with a lot of facial cleansers. It doesn’t have any particular scent like a floral scent or a Shea butter scent but it does have that cleansing scent which I love. I would definitely buy this in the future again! So glad I received this from Influenster in a voxbox!
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,Face feels amazing!,"I really enjoyed this cleanser. I got the Spirulina infused bottle in my VoxBox. It has a mild, fresh scent without being overpowering. A little will to a long way, so this bottle will really last awhile. I was impressed because most cleansers that state they can ""tone"" usually don't and I have to use a toner afterward, but this one followed through! I do wish they had fewer or more natural ingredients, but it did a great job so I can look past that. I plan to try the Turmeric next!"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Not good for aging skin,"I have purchased this cleanser for years and it was perfect for basic cleansing. No irritation or break outs but not great at removed any make up. As I age (now over 30), I found this cleanser too drying and will have to find a replacement."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,Great for make up removal,Smells fresh and clean. Does not leave a residue. I did not feel like it stripped my skin of the natural oils but it did leave it extra shiny.  I have extremely sensitive skin and some cleansers turn my face red immediately after use. I did not have any redness after this.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,Recommend this product I received it from voxbox and im in loved
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,"I tried the limited edition, tumeric infused kind. While I do stan it's ingredients and effectiveness, the price point is a bit steep. While, yes I would recommend it as a nice and effective step to your night/morning routine, you can certainly find a cheaper yet stillbeffective alternative. 
  If you're wanting to treat and delight your senses, I'd say to try it out!"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,No Bueno,This Broke Out My Face So Bad Red Spots Appeared On My Face After Use. I Will Never Purchase This Item Again.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,awesome!,Love this product. Love removing make up with this simple cleanser. I see a visible difference how my skin looks like since I started using this one. No acnes. Plus for a value size.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,Great Classic,I love that this cleanser is fresh for 2 years. It leaves my face feeling clean and still moisturized. Not striped of all moisture
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser - 240ml,This is one of the best facial cleansers that won't break your skin out and will cleanse your skin without stripping it.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,Canada,Not for sensitive skin.,The first use my skin looked great. With continued use my face turned red as a tomato and broken out.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser,USA,Ehh,Does leave my skin feeling clean but also left it feeling dry and stripped of any kind of moisture. Glad I got the small to try it out.

IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Malaysia,It's OK,It's gentle and doesn't dry my skin out. Lathers well even with tiny amount. Downside..don't like the scent. It smells like plastic.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,Perfect hydrating cleanser!,"This is my go to cleanser - especially during drier months. Paired with an oil cleanser to get off makeup, this stuff works like an absolute charm, and doesn't leave my face feeling stripped afterwards. I love that it doesn't dry my skin out, but also doesn't leave an awkward film on my face (or leaves me feeling like there's still dirt on my skin) like other cleansers."

IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Australia,nice but pricey,This is a lovely product and has a fresh scent. It does not leave your skin feeling stripped of moisture but you definitely feel like your skin is cleansed. I probably would not buy it again as I think there are drugstore products that are equal to the job or even something from The Inky List would do the trick.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Malaysia,so so,"I have mature skin and quite acne prone so decided to give this one a try. It is so so for me, not great and not bad. It doesnt dry out my skin or anything but feel like the murad one i have does a better job for me."

IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,Great for sensitive/reactive skin!,I love it! I purchased a mini-size and once it runs out I will be purchasing the full size. It is very gentle on my reactive skin. I have a difficult time finding a cleanser to gently remove my makeup and non-drying at the same time. This cleanser is non-foaming lotion-y serum. It takes off all of my make up and rinses clean with a very clean feeling. It does not sting/burn or leave my face dry afterwards. I also use tretinoin and the cleanser does not irritate my skin which is very rare.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,"New and ""improved"" NOT an improvement","Loved this cleanser before the ""new and approved"" formula change. I used it everyday for the past three years. The new formula smells like burning plastic and does not completely remove my make-up. It also burns my eyes - a very troubling sign. Very disappointing!"

I use it alone in the morning and also as the first step of my double cleanse routine at night. A little goes a long way with this cleanser, I totally recommend it!!!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Australia,Love it!,"This has been my everyday cleanser for the past year now. I absolutely love it.

IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Australia,Not sure,"Slight lemon citrus scent. A creamy gel texture that doesn’t foam, if it does then not noticeable. Reasonable at first cleanse makeup removing, not great. Not sure I’ve seen any skin improvement as the product claims, but my skin is pretty good. I think you can find similar and even better at cheaper price point. Nice enough, just not amazing. "

IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Australia,My Favourite!!,"Even though I have oily skin, this cleanser is still my favourite! It has a rich creamy texture that makes my skin feel so soft. I love the smell and it melts away my make up gently. Rate it!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Philippines,One of my faves,"Although it is relatively pricey, even though it's calming, it effectively melts away makeup, making it an excellent choice for those with extremely sensitive or ""acne-prone"" skin types. In addition, it leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry, which is ideal for people who hate the tight and dried out feeling that many face cleansers leave behind on their skin, such as those with sensitive skin."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,must try!,Love this cleanser. It removed all my makeup without drying out my skin.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Malaysia,Good Product ,"Very soothing cleanser. After using , it makes my skin more fresh and bright. Certainly will buy again. Already have recommended to my familiar ones. 😊"

IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Malaysia,Nice cleanser,Good cleanser. My favourite.  Do not dry my face after use.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Canada,My favourite face wash,"I use their moisturizer and this face wash. I have very sensitive skin and I'm allergic to a lot of products, but this one is quite nice to use daily. I don't find it dries me out, I usually use it in combo to their confidence in a moisturizer. I have rosacea and this does not trigger it whatsoever. I actually think its one of few products that do help with keeping it at bay. Sometimes I add a little bit of coffee grinds to give myself a nice exfoliation too. I have been using this for about two years w/ the moisturizer."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,Favorite cleanser,"Favorite cleanser!  I have very dry and sensitive skin, and this cleanser does not contribute to either in a negative way.  Skin feels hydrated and clean, but does not feel stripped.  I had a hard time finding a cleanser that will remove make up completely without stripping my skin and making it drier.  This is IT!  I also love how I can add a little water to my fingertips while working the product in and even when going over my eyes with it, it will not sting or get in my eyes.  I took a mini version on a vacation with my sister and she had to borrow it.  We have different skin types and she wears a little more makeup than I do, but she absolutely loved this cleanser as well and ended up ordering some after trying mine."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Singapore,Confidence I A Cleanser,"First time using this cleanser and it does the skin well with feeling of smooth and cleaned. Skin seems better after using it, and have repurchased with sales."

Highly recommend this entire skincare line!"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Singapore,Clean,"As a face cleaner, my face do feel clean after using it and doesn't feel dry. It smells a little bit orange which is nice while using it. The price is affordable compared to other similar products"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Australia,Love! Love! Love! ,Love everything about it. I keep trying other cleansers but always come back to this one. I have combination oily skin. This doesn’t dry it out at all. My skin feels clean but well looked after. It genuinely feels like it’s receiving the benefits it requires. 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,New Zealand,Nice cleanser...,Nice cleanser and good as a second step cleanse but for the price there are better formulas which I would re purchase for my skin before this one. Love and do repurchase other products from this brand though
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Singapore,A good cleanser for sensitive skin! ,"Always had good impression on IT Cosmetics makeup products but not on skincare type. Bought this during 20% sale to try out. It is a gentle daily cleanser for sensitive skin. If want to say the bad point, would be the price. I believe there are other cheaper cleansers out there for sensitive skin. "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Cleanser,Gentle and washes off my face without my skin feeling dry. A little goes a long way! Not sure about it’s anti aging properties but it does what I’m looking for
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,New Zealand,Really works,Second time purchased as I really love it and works so well. Cleanses well and leaves a fresh feeling combined with a lemony scent. My skin feels a bit shiny too after each wash. Definitely recommended 👌 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,Very effective but gentle,"Gets all of my makeup off - even the waterproof stuff.  Super gentle and doesn’t break out my sensitive, acne-prone skin, leaves skin feeling clean.  Smells like fruit cereal but is a good smell."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,Drying,"I received a sample of this and was excited to try. Wanted to love it, unfortunately, this really dried out my skin so much on first use. If your skin is sensitive or dry, I would avoid."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Singapore,Love this gentle non stripping cleanser!,"Love how this cleanser gently cleanse my skin without stripping, doesn’t leave the tight feeling after washing. Leaves my face smooth after use. Not sure how effective it removes makeup as I prefer to double cleanse. Using it as a morning cleanser and second cleansers night. Foams up easily. "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Singapore,repeat order,This cleanser leaves my skin clean and fresh. It worked well for my sensitive skin and I feel I could trust it as my regular facial cleanser. I am halfway through my first tube and have already bought a second one to stock up.

IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Cleanser,"I loved it, my face is soft and moisturized, the only bad thing is that it should be bigger for the price it has."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,Soft skin!,I couldn’t believe how soft my skin was after the first time using this! I immediately stocked up when it was on sale! It has been great for anti-aging and breakouts! This is now the only cleanser I use!
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,Another goody for my skin..!,"I am 44 and currently using Cerave Hydrating Cleanser, which I love and use daily morning and night. I decided to give this a try because of all the good reviews people gives to it. The It Cosmetics Cleanser does not strip nor tightens my face (thank God..!!); my skin feels clean, soft and hydrated. My skin is combo (dry, oily t zone). I also started using the face moisturizer from the same brand and also love it. The only downside is that the It Cosmetics Cleanser burns into the eyes whereas the Cerave does not."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Cleanser,This has a luxurious creamy feel and didn’t strip my skin. However it failed at removing my makeup.   Like failed completely.  I would not repurchase.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Cleanser,"Holy face wash
I love this face wash. It’s super thick snd pared with IT cosmetics confidence in a cream moisturizer or sleep confidence in a cream."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,Noticeable results in just a few days.,"I have tried other cleansers but this seems to be the one I come back to the most. It smells great and doesn't leave my skin dry and tight afterwords. It removes makeup really well, I stocked up on Purity but it doesn't come close to this product. I love how after a few days I can see results. I also feel like there's good value here, 5 ounces lasts a while since you don't need much to do the job if you don't wear heavy makeup."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,Refreshing scent and amazing feel,"This gentle creamy cleanser has a nice refreshing scent, and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. Not sure how well it removes makeup but it is definitely a great product. I can't wait to try more in this product line."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Canada,A go-to cleanser with a subtle citrus scent,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The subtle citrus scent enhances the experience of cleansing your face. A little goes a long way. It starts off as a gel, and with the addition of water it works into a gentle, soothing foam. I have combination skin, so it’s a challenge to find products which can cleanse the oily T-region without leaving your cheeks tight and dry. This cleanser works perfectly for that. It leaves my whole face feeling balanced. I have made it my go-to facial cleanser morning and evening."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Singapore,normal cleanser ,"It says Confidence In A Cleanser however I find it just a normal facial cleanser, nothing to shout about. It’s very foamy cleanser I have to say………. It’s a big tub and for this price, I find it reasonable "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Australia,good basic product,A nice product. Very soft and gentle. I’m sure there are better ones but this is just a staple for me. It’s really smooth on my sensitive skin and gets the job done wel
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Australia,Love,I have just ordered my 3rd cleanser I love how well this one works and how my skin does not feel right or dry after using. 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Singapore,great product!,This is a great product for combination/oily skin as it does not leave an oily residue after washing. It’s also moisturising and does not strip your face of your natural oils. 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Australia,Better elsewhere,"This isn't the best cleanser available for the price. It's ok. Does the job pretty well. And admittedly, does feel really nice. But for the price...I wouldn't repurchase"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Australia,Cleanser,happy with results from this product and have found this meets all the expectations you'd have from a cleanser. started with smaller size but bought full sized product pleased with the clean feeling this leaves on your face. 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,don’t try IT for 30 like me,"It’s an average product. It very much reminds of me of the yellow philosophy line, from the smell to the consistency.

It’s not packing in moisturize like I hoped but my skin is no drier than before. As far as anti aging or confidence - I haven’t seen signs of either!  

I wish this was a pump cleanser because the tube is hassley with wet hands, and seems kind of cheapy to me. For 30 dollars it should be better packaging."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Canada,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Cleanser,"I really like this cleanser my skin never feels stripped or tight,my skin always feels soft and I love the fresh smell. A must try."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Singapore,Great product,I like this cleanser. It cleanses effectively and leaves my skin smooth and fresh. I don't get the drying feel like some products give after use. It really suits me well.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Canada,Gentle and Clearing,"This cleanser is amazing and is very gentle. I have combination skin, and this product (paired with a great moisturizer) seemed to mitigate oil and dryness to achieve the perfect balance. I purchased it for the stellar ingredients list (anti-aging collagen, hyaluronic acid, colloidal oatmeal, super ceramide complex, etc) and after a week of use I could see positive results in my skin's clarity and elasticity. The 5 oz size has also lasted me a long time because you only need a quarter sized amount per wash."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,Solid daily cleanser,"I don't have anything groundbreaking to share. I've been using this cleanser daily for almost a year and I quite like it. My skin is on the oilier side, so this does not dry me out. I don't rely on this cleanser to do a super deep clean, that's what my masks/scrubs are for. Overall, this is a solid daily cleanser. I like the creamy texture that foams nicely and the scent isn't overpowering."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,pleasantly surprised,"I really like this cleanser. I didn’t expect to like it as much as I did. My face feels fresh, smooth, and clean every time I use it. So far I have not had any problems with it. Would definitely recommend."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Canada,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Cleanser,"This became one of my favourite cleansers after ordering it during quarantine 2020. I have combo skin - oily nose, dry everywhere else. It doesn't strip the skin. It doesn't foam much, either. It has a serum texture. I incorporated it into my k-beauty skin routine, and it works so well so keep me glowy and soft. You may not like it if you're extremely oily or have chronic acne, but if you're dry and sensitive, this may be for you. If you're buying this solely for the anti-aging benefits, I'd recommend you buy a day/night cream instead, because this will only be on your face for a few minutes. If you're already using other anti-aging products, then it can't hurt to add this."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Canada,Don't buy if you want clean & hydrated skin,"I wasn't expecting this cleanser to feel like a moisturizer. It doesn't give that clean feeling after use and did not hydrate my skin. My skin felt really dry and tight. It does have a very subtle sent which is great for my reactive skin, it also apparently targets anti-aging which I was told is not its main feature by a Sephora employee....even though it says that on the front."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Canada,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Cleanser,Genuinely a confidence booster! I received this product when I worked for Sephora and gave it to my mom to try out. The transformation in her skin was immaculate! Her skin looks so clear and radiant after using this product and she is always beaming because of it!
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Cleanser,Absolute best! This face wash does not dry out skin and helps prevent breakouts!
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Canada,"okay, but not mind-blowing","This is an okay cleanser, it's gentle and appropriate for daily use. I'm not sure I trust it to give me the deep clean I need after a workout though."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Canada,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Cleanser,"Absolutely love this cleanser! Very underrated! It has amazing ingredients for cleansing, clearing and soothing the skin. I have oily to dry skin and after using this cleanser I’ve seen a huge difference after one wash. My face feels healthier and smooth."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,In Love!,"This is hands down the best cleanser I’ve ever used, it seriously makes my skin feel clean and moisturized at the same time. It honestly blows my mind. 11/10 would recommend."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,Try this!! IT works.,"This stuff is gold! It takes makeup off without having to scrub hard, had a light pleasant scent, and a little goes a long way! My dry skin doesn’t feel overly dry after using this and they have great sales on their website as well as at Ulta so you can save a few bucks which is great. Definitely worth trying! I easily give it 5/5 stars"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,excellent value for the money,"Have been using Fresh Soy Facial Cleanser for several years, which I love, except for the price.
Was looking for something much like Soy and found it with this product."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Australia,Keep going back...,I have now purchased this cleanser three times and I know I will keep going back. It cleanses the skin without leaving your skin feeling tight.  Leaves the skin feeling soft and supple.  I like to use this cleanser in the morning best. 
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Singapore,Confidence in a Cleaner,"I've just finished my first tube. Am I buying again? I'm not sure yet. Yes, it does remove my waterproof mascara, not completely, but almost 95% of it. But you need double cleansing that is! Good on my sensitive skin, no breakout or over drying. But thats about it, i don't see any other significant improvements 🙃"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,"Nice gentle clean, refreshing scent","This product came as part of a sample bag promo.. the brand was never really on my radar.. but i have been pleasantly surprised with how much i like it... leaves my skin feeling nice and clean at the end of the day, helps with oily skin, and the scent is very refreshing. I like this one as a milder balance to some of the more abrasive, enzyme-powered face cleansers I use. will definitely be purchasing again."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Malaysia,The best cleanser,The texture is so nice and really suit my skin. There’s improvements with my pores and did not leave my skin feel dry. I massage evenly on my face and leave it sit for 2-3 minute before I was my face thoroughly.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,wonderful,Makes my skin feel awesome washes all traces of makeup and mascara away  leaving my skin clean but not tight and dry.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,Malaysia,Excellent product!,"The price for this face wash is definitely on the expensive side, but being a fan of IT Cosmetics, I was very keen to try and bought it during the 20%sale. I am not disappointed. After washing it leaves the skin feels soft without the feeling of dryness or tightness. My face keeps feeling soft the whole day. It cleans well too. The size of the product also makes it lasts a long time which is a good investment in the long run. Will definitely buy again"
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,IT Cosmetics Confidence In A Cleanser,In love with this cleanser...makes my face feel & look hydrated & plump without over stripping.
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,Great for Dry skin.,"I thought for years that my skin was combination, but it is actually Dry. For years, I used Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser - the foaming version - and while I loved it, I didnt realize that it was drying out my skin even more. I received a sample of this and it completely changed my self care life! It has got a slight smell - reminds me of philosophy cleanser - and a little goes a long way. If you are on the fence, I suggest trying a sample (which is how I found it originally)! Love this cleanser so much. Another great product for me from IT."
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,New Zealand,Great cleanser!,"Love how silky and creamy this cleanser is! So soft and leaves skin feeling moisturised and not dried out at all, even gently takes off eye makeup. Have just bought my second bottle. "
IT COSMETICS-Confidence In A Cleanser,USA,Love it. 2nd purchase!!!,"This is my 2nd purchase.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing & Hydrating Micellar Water,Singapore,don't bother,"I got this because of the tester in store which felt so refreshing and the scent was so soothing. Overall, it could've been the aircon making this feel more cooling than it is. It is a basic micellar water except it is too fragranced and doesn't quite live up to bioderma. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing & Hydrating Micellar Water,Singapore,Ms,Always love the house brand Sephora good price good ingredients  remove my makeup before cleansing is a important step no fail ok on my sensitive skin too

It does not sting the eyes and my skin doesn't feel tight or uncomfortable... good for sensitive skin. "

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing & Hydrating Micellar Water,Malaysia,gentle yet effective to remove makeup for sensitive dehydrated skin,"I am happy to return back to sephora collection after they discontinued producing a similar makeup remover targetted specifically for sensitive dehydrated skin. For past two years, I venture to other famous brands like Dior and Bobbi Brown but Sephora Collection still wins in terms of value for money and product efficacy."

GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Singapore,2nd Favourite!,"I’ve used this balm before and I like how it does melts my heavy makeup and glitters. My 2nd time purchasing them. Importantly, a cleansing balm that is friendly for prone-acne skin. "
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Singapore,the best,this is my favourite cleansing balm. i’ve used a few other brands but they don’t work quite as well as this does. this removes my waterproof makeup and i dont have to go over it over and over again. i really love this!
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Canada,Amazing makeup removal in a double cleanse routine,"This works amazing to get my makeup off as a first step, followed by my usual face wash. Great in a double cleanse routine!!! It does smell a bit sweet but is not overly off putting. I would not use this as a stand alone cleanser, but for makeup wearers this is definitely a holy grail!"
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,"This gets the job done as a first step in a double cleanse process. I use this first, then follow up with a gel cleanser in the evenings and I have no issues. Skins feels soft and clean."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Great make up remover. It's heavy for a travel kit because the container is made of glass but I just scoop a good amount and put it in a travel jar.
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,squeaky clean,Finally found a good balm cleanser. Melts into the skin. only need a small amount. removes all the make up and leaves the skin moisturised.  Good for removing heavy eye make up. it is not oily or greasy.
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,A must-have in my routine!,"Sorbet like texture that gently and effectively removes makeup and layers of sunscreen and washes away easily with water leaving no residue.

Be mindful that it contains enzymes so it may be too much for those with sensitive skin or those on retinoids"
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Perfect Cleansing Balm,I love this product so much. It makes even waterproof mascara just slide right off the skin. It smells and feels amazing and my skin always feels so clean after using it. Perfect for a nighttime double cleansing routingroutinedouble cleansing
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Armpit Detox!,Been using this since April/May-ish…as an underarm detox &&& I definitely see a difference in the smoothness in my armpits. Plus even tone! Yes you read that correctly! I use this as an underarm cleanser and Im not ashamed *shrug*
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,My Fav!,My skin felt so soft after using this!!!! It also smells so good. Definitely repurchasing.
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,x1000 YES🙌🏼,"This smells amazing and doesnt leave any residue on the skin, it takes off a full face of makeup easily, even waterproof mascara. I highly recommend!"
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,"Great for some, not so much for others",Cleanses face amazingly but mascara not so much. I recommend unless all you wear is mascara.
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Smoother skin = Win,I have been using this religiously as a makeup remover and have felt a nearly instant difference in the texture of my skin. So smooth! I see a lot of other reviews saying things about a residue is leaves. I bet it would if I didn’t know I needed to remove the balm with a face wash… I’ll be purchasing again when I run out in a couple months.
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,It pains me to say that I love this. I normally use the INKEY list oat cleansing balm and have only ever used that for an oil makeup remover. It’s significantly cheaper and I never had problems with it but they were out of stock and I needed a makeup remover. So I went with this one despite the price and YES it is worth the money. It rubs on more nicely than the other and it comes off much easier/removes makeup cleaner than the INKEY list balm. My only concern is I wonder if this will last me a long enough time with the amount in the jar. But I have sensitive acne prone skin and it hasn’t caused me any new breakouts.
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Too Much Fragrance!,"I don’t consider myself to have sensitive skin, but this product caused me to have one of the worst breakouts. There is so much fragrance in it, that even with double cleansing it still clogged my pores. It removes makeup, but there are better options out there for the same or cheaper price."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Residue,"Smells great, works well, removes makeup and daily oils when rubbed on a dry face, but after you add water it turns into this goopy residue that requires a face cloth to remove. Impossible to remove with just water. Kind of annoying to remove."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Works,"This does work. I use it to remove makeup, sunscreen and motor oil on a daily basis. I wish it has a better price point. It's effective but I think I'm going to try something else when it runs out. The scent is pretty strong fyi, if you have skin sensitivities avoid this product."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,"This product melts even waterproof makeup off in seconds and leaves skin feeling cleansed and hydrated afterwards. Also has a yummy fruity smell that isn’t too overpowering. A little goes a long way, so this will last a long time before having to repurchase."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Canada,Love this stuff!,Love this stuff! It really helps get a good clean! I used it a few times a week. Mine didn’t come with a scooper though :S
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,"Sometimes when I’m lazy I use this as my only cleaner instead of the first step in my double cleanse and it really does the job. It smells great, too! My only complaint is it’s pricey but it also incentivizes me to use it so you win some you lose some. Seems very gentle and doesn’t sting my eyes."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,best cleansing balm,"Best cleansing balm ever! Make sure to always get it out with dry hands if you don’t have a scoop or it will ruin the product. I have used it for everyday makeup, stage makeup and full glam it never disappoints removes everything and leaves skin feeling great. I tried versed when this one was out of stock at my store and it doesn’t even compare."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Canada,Changed my skin!,"Wow! I have been a dedicated Clinique cleansing foam user for my daily double cleanse up until recently when a trip to a dermatologist a few months ago screwed up my skin to no end. After several months, I happened upon a sample of this product and gave it a whirl. After one use my skin was smoother, glowing and felt squeaky clean without any associated dryness. My skin just continued to heal each day I used this in my double cleanse. My fine lines have lessened and my skin is smooth while the breakouts have calmed. No allergic reaction or irritation either! The oils used here are low on the comedogenic rating too. It’s worth giving this balm a try if you’ve been struggling with your breakouts like I have."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Singapore,love the scent,I love Glow Recipe products for the mild scents that really makes you excited to do your skincare. this balm is okay as i am not a fan on the film that is left behind. but i would use it for a pampering session
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Singapore,clean & care,"This is the balm I repurchased and will continue so. The price is reasonable, while its efficacy is as it claimed. Papaya scent is relaxing too. Really recommend for anyone who’s keen to discard cotton pads from your remover routine. "
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Canada,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,"Removes makeup well. You don’t need to use much, I like to follow up with my facial cleanser after."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,New favorite makeup remover balm!!,"My favorite makeup removing balm!! Smells so good, has the best texture, and removes all my makeup. 10/10"
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,wouldn’t buy unfortunately,I love Glow Recipe but this was so hard to completely remove. The balm doesn’t get rid of makeup as much as I wanted and it’s really annoying trying to get the cleansing remover residue off too.
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,YESSSS,"my favorite of all the cleansing balms i've tried. i've repurchased about three times already. it has a nice fresh scent that's not too overwhelming, and the texture is amazing. it takes off my makeup so wonderfully."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Singapore,recommend ,love this. removes my makeup really easily and quick. doesnt leave a oily residue and my skin is hydrated. its not oily nor dry like other cleansing balm. would recommend 
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,"Nice, gentle makeup remover!","This is a wonderful, gentle makeup remover. I love the smell, the formula leaves me feeling super refreshed. I love the earth-friendly packaging! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I feel like you have to use quite a lot to get a full face of foundation off, and I still have to use micellar water to get my eye makeup off."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,best makeup remover,My go-to makeup remover! Smells like a summer starburst!
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,give it a try,"Love and hate relationship.. like everyone say when applying it and rubbing numerous of times.. it feels like you can’t get it off of your face, so you keep rubbing and rubbing till your face feels clean. After using my face is super soft and no trace of makeup. It always cleared out white heads in my nose area. I love it.. it has a weird texture but my face never been this soft  and clean."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,ditch the wipes get a cleansing balm,I’m obsessed with how quickly and easy my makeup comes off with this! Melts it right off. I have pretty sensitive skin so most makeup removers irritate it but this product has been the first to not trigger my eczema! I love it
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Singapore,not bad.,it was my first time using this. previously was using drunk elephant's and huda beauty's. if comparing to all 3. my go to would be huda's then drunk elephant's would be second and this is my last choice.  it does feel like theres film on your face after washing off. 
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Canada,horrible,I need to cleanse my face 3 times to get rid of the makeup and it still leaves a weird layer. The smell is meh.
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,amazziiiing,amazing makeup remover! this stuff even removed eyelash glue out of my eyelashes. I rubbed it all into my lashes and used a spoolie and it took all the gunk from my lash line from wearing lashes. it is now my go to cleanser for my eyes when I have my heavy makeup days.
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Meh & I don’t like the smell,I had high hopes for this product but it smells like artificial sweets and is ok at removing product off my face. Not worth it in my opinion there are cheaper alternatives.
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,"This balm was just okay for me. I didn't notice that it clogged my pores, and it did remove my light makeup. 

It has a weird smell to me, but I haven't noticed anyone else mention that in the reviews. It smells like mineral spirits or some kind of shop cleaner. I'm pretty picky about scents, though. 

I definitely need to double cleanse when using this, but I probably should anyways to remove my sunscreen. 

For the money, I feel like you could probably get something equally as good for less. I do love that Glow Recipe is certified by Leaping Bunny and they are a clean brand, but I'm just not wowed in any way by this particular balm."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,"fair product, will not repurchase","Not a bad product. Overall it does the job, wipes makeup clean but for price I think there are so many other options out there. Really didn’t add anything to my routine but also didn’t make it terrible."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,So good!,i love this product so much! It effectively removes my makeup.
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,love,I love this cleansing balm it melts all of my makeup in a second and washes off easily and doesn’t make me feel oily
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Singapore,Perfect cleansing balm,I love this cleansing balm as part of my double cleansing regime! It melts waterproof makeup really well and my face feels super clean after rinsing it off. Smell is nice and really gentle on the skin. Love it!
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,very nice product.,Very nice feeling and does not break me out. I love how it cleaned out my pores and the scent is not overpowering and very pleasant.
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,My Holy Grail!,"I've been purchasing this product for a little over a year now and absolutely swear by it. I recommend it to all of my friends and family and they end up loving it to! I don't experience any film being left behind on my face (make sure you're emulsifying it people!) and it doesn't make me go blind for a couple minutes, like quite a few other cleansing balms do (**cough cough Green Clean**). 
The scent is....something to get used to, but it does not linger after I wash it off and use a second cleanser. 
TL;DR: A great cleansing balm for makeup and sunscreen removal!"
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Singapore,Its good ,"Always a fan of glow recipe .Like this product . Works well for me takes off make up or sunscreen well. Doesn’t dry out skin , feels soft and hydrated actually. Will buy again when needed"
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Canada,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,"The best balm I have ever used. It gets rid of all my makeup including sunscreen, it doesn’t sting my eyes at all. And has a yummy scent."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,Effortless makeup removal,This cleansing balm works very well on the skin to remove the makeup. Feels hydrating and very smooth upon face wash. Suitable for double cleanse with foam cleanser after. Leaves almost no residual makeup on face
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,"this does what it needs to do, but completely clogs my reusable wipes. i finally had to throw the rest of it away because i can’t get it all off, if you use disposable wipes it should work just fine, but don’t risk compromising the integrity of your cloth ones!"
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Singapore,Best Product Ever!,I'm on my third tub!! That's how amazing this product is!! It lasted me about 3 months + because you just need a small amount to remove your makeup. It even removes waterproof mascara! You need this!
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Canada,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Love this makes my skin feel so soft and clean and smells so nice
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,average balm cleanser,"average balm cleanser, gets sunscreen off well. i'm not a fan of the smell though, but i'm also weird with fruit scents. does feel like theres a film on your face after you wash it off so if you dont like that you'll have to scrub longer than usual."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,Love it,"This is my second bottle after my first impulse purchase. The smell is amazing. Works fine on me. Yes, it does leave a film thing after you wash your face but this can be easily removed if you are double cleansing. I use this everyday since I wear sunscreen to work so it has no adverse effect on my skin. Just to make sure not to use too much or else you’re wasting the product. So far have not had the balm turn into liquid eventho it’s stored in a dark place with closed door. "
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,I adore the packaging and the light fresh smell. This product does an amazing job of melting the makeup right off my face. Definitely will order this product again!
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Singapore,hmmm,"Melts my makeup no lie but it just keeps dissolving on its own into liquid even when stored in normal room temp away from sun, and that’s very frustrating since the scoop is flat and it’s hard to get it out of the jar. Stings my eyes but every cleansing balm does that to my eyes so I don’t think it’s the balm’s issue haha. But the melting issue alone is enough for me to not buy it again since clean it zero does the EXACT same thing but at a fraction of the price lol"
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Buy!,Highly recommend this cleansing balm! I use it as the first step in my double cleanse after a long day of make up wear. It takes off tough make up but doesn’t burn my eyes or leave a waxy feeling on my skin. Slight “fruity” smell of papaya. Very slight!
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,BEST CLEANSING BALM EVER,"this is the best cleansing balm ever!!!! removed makeup easily, not drying and most importantly does not sting my eyes. havent tried farmacy’s yet but si far this is the bestttt"
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Singapore,not bad !! ,"Really nice smelling, easy to use balm cleanser. Perfect for removing a day’s makeup. It can leave a film if too much is used, but goes away if followed up with a second cleanse. Sits pretty by the sink, comes with a spatula which helps. "
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Canada,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,"My makeup really does MELT off, just as advertised! Better yet it does so quickly and my skin feels soft and clean afterwards. Absolutely buying this product again! Plus, it smells great!"
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Canada,Improved my skin texture!,"Surprisingly this review isn’t about removing makeup, but about how well this has removed my skin texture! I’ve used this a few times now on the rare days I wear makeup or sunscreen, and every single time it makes my face so smooth and appears to remove the texture. Taking away a star because it dries me out and can burn sometimes a bit, but for me it’s worth it just for the improvement in my skin texture!"
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Did not live up to expectations,"Honestly expected so much more from this product. While it does remove makeup (like many washes), I found it to be greasy and not pleasant smelling. Smelled more like plastic than papaya. Disappointing."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,Serves the purpose,"Works fine for me as the first step of my doible cleasing routine. I’m not wearing heavy make up though. Just foundation & powder. Overall, it does what ot should for me."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Singapore,Replace this with your wipes,You can trash all wipes and get this! Amazing & I can feel my makeup all went out. Double cleansing its a must! Buy buy buy. The smell like sorbet really! 
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Smells and works great,"This is now my favorite makeup remover! The balm melts easily in my hands, and makes removing my waterproof mascara a breeze. I love the slightly fruity smell as it makes cleansing my face feel like a special treat."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,This is a regular part of my routine.,"This is a regular part of my routine.  Although it says that you need to use a second cleanser, I do not always.  In the morning this cleanser is plenty on my prior night skin routine.  That being said, I often do facials and may use something like Fresh Sugar Scrub or MILK watermelon brightening mask/stick after this and before using a facial device.   I also do not wear a lot of makeup in general, and may be simply washing off tinted sunblock with a little cover up.  At night, this is often enough depending on what I am doing.  I may follow it with the Dr. Dennis Gross peel/wipes.  In these cases, a second cleanser would be too much for me.  I do love this product, my skin feels very clean afterwards and I never feel like there is a residue.  I love the way that I can tailor it with other products."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,It removed my makeup so easy. I use waterproof mascara and this is so much better than use makeup remover. But it’s smells a like bit strong
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Canada,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,"I really do love this, but you need to follow up with a face cleanser"
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,Best cleansing balm ,"So far, I loved this one cleansing balm with pleasent smell and can remove makeup completely. My skin feel so smooth after cleansing with this balm. Worth it!"
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,"I love this makeup remover. It removes all my makeup, and leaves my skin so smooth. I use a lot of waterproof mascara and this product removes it all without leaving any residues."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,very good product - doesn’t break you out,"It’s a pretty good product for makeup removal. I would say it’s not the best I’ve used, but I’m not upset by it. The one thing it has going for it over my previously used cleansing balms/makeup melts is that it does not break out my skin. Drunk Elephant works better than this, but it destroys my skin. So I think it’s a good trade-off considering. I’ve also tried Farmacy’s balm and I still like this one over it."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Canada,Smells sweet but leaves a sticky mess.,"I love the feel and the smell of this product-- but I will say that compared to other balms I have tried, it isn't my favourite (even though the smell is).

When I use it I find it leaves a film over my skin that I have to wash or wipe away. This isn't a horrible thing to have happen, but when other balms do the same work with less mess, I can't give this product a perfect rating. I would purchase it in a pinch or if nothing else was available, but despite how much I love the scent, I don't think I will get it again."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Canada,never again,"I really was NOT impressed by this product…It takes about three rounds of cleansing, rinsing and repeating with this product in order for my face to feel even a little bit clean. It did NOT take my makeup off"
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,"It smells and feels luxurious and leaves my skin feeling super clean and even leaves behind a nice feeling of moisture, but it is best removed with a wash cloth. I prefer a precleansing product that rinses off with water, so I probably won’t try again."
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Singapore,normal ,My friend recommended this to me. I have dry skin and it does remove the make up well. However I don’t see any additional benefits to justify for the price point. 
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,waxy,I wanted to like it but it felt like washing my face with melted candle wax. Leaves a waxy residue I’m not fond of so I have to triple wash to get it off.
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,GOD’S GOOP!,I just bought this product today and I used it right away. My combo skin is GLISTENING! It’s super hydrating and moisturizing. I can already tell I’m going to love this stuff Stop thinking— just buy!
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Canada,incredible makeup remover!,This product is amazing! It removes all my makeup (and I wear a lot of eye makeup) and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  I have acne prone skin and it doesn’t break me out.  Smells lovely and fruity.  Highly recommend!!!
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Removes everything in one step!,"As a flight attendant i am required to wear cosmetics for work. I use long wear products that soap or cream cleanser doesn’t completely remove. I can see it on my cleansing brush. Since I am a big fan of apricot oil decided to try this. Removes everything in one step and no more flaky, dry patches. I usually massage it in the leave for a couple of minutes to soften and allow the enzymes to work then massage again and rinse. Not a trace of mascara or long wear foundation. Best part is it’s cruelty-free!"
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,left my skin feeling good but not all my makeup came off
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,So far my favorite cleansing balm. Doesn't leave my face feeling greasy. Removes all the makeup.
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Singapore,good cleansing balm,The texture is soft and easy to spread. The scent is not too strong. Quite effective in removing makeup. This is one of my favorite cleansing balm. Will repurchase.
GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Canada,"So far, so good!","I used it for the first time tonight since I was out of my farmacy cleansing balm and although it may be too early to say, but I think I found a new favourite! This one glides on my skin a lot smoother than the farmacy cleansing balm does. 

I still have to see how it effects my skin in the long term but upon first impressions, my skin feels amazing!

With every cleansing balm, I always do a double or triple cleanse to ensure there’s no makeup residue leftover. I find a cleansing balm is great at gently loosening long lasting makeup like mascara without tugging and damaging skin. I used the ole henriksen wonderfeel double cleanse (discontinued) and the truth juice cleanser. I feel like the 2 totally took everything off.

Will update if any future adverse reactions."

GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,Canada,pros and cons..,"I’ve been loyal to Farmacy’s green clean for over a year now but wanted to try this out after reading the good reviews.

But I love how gentle yet powerful this formula is, a little goes a long way."

GLOW RECIPE-Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm,USA,Nice product,"Nice product, but it tends to not break up when applying on skin.

It doesn’t irritate my eyes when I use it on my eye makeup, and my face feels so smooth once I rinse it off. I’ve never had an issue with it clogging my pores either. Make no mistake, this is only a first cleanse, so you’ll need to follow it up with another facial wash once you rinse this off. Also be mindful that if you are sensitive to scents, this product may affect you. I personally find the tropical scent amazing, and it doesn’t cause any issues with me. Overall an excellent product!"

ORIGINS-Checks and Balances™ Frothy Face Wash,Malaysia,value for money,"Wow, this lasted me for almost 8 months.  A little goes a long way and the right way to use it is to put some product on damp hands, froth it and rub in circular motions on your face."
ORIGINS-Checks and Balances™ Frothy Face Wash,Malaysia,So-So Product,"Doesn’t do much on my skin because after a few times using, I have bumps on my forehead so I stopped usinh it. However it does leave my face with a feeling of “cooling” and minty sensation. "
ORIGINS-Checks and Balances™ Frothy Face Wash,Singapore,Does it's job,"Comfortable to use, no faults, does what it says, suitable for my normal skin that is slightly sensitive and gets red easily but i wouldnt say holy-grail status. Clean , nothing left on my toner cotton pad but not tight squeaky clean. It's 'boring' so i dont really repurchase it but i find myself going back to it when i dont know which cleanser to try next."

ORIGINS-Checks and Balances™ Frothy Face Wash,Malaysia,Great product ,Have been trying most of the origin cleansers and this is by far the best for me . I have been using this product for 5 yrs now.

ORIGINS-Checks and Balances™ Frothy Face Wash,Malaysia,Really good but pricey ,"I have combination oily skin and this product work wonders on my skin. It helps refresh my skin, it makes my skin softer, and my T zone and U zone is balance. Only down fall... IT'S TOO PRICEY but it's worth it."

SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,hard pass,totally unrecognizable. does very little. doesn't foam up. doesn't leave you feel clean and doesn't always get makeup off. SOOOO many better cleansers  out there
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Singapore,good and expensive,good quality. can really wash your face clean without drying your skin. I like it. and of course it is an expensive choice. yes still u can choose other products.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Nice cleanser for oily/acne-prone,"You get a nice creamy-slightly-foamy consistency, and my skin has never felt stripped afterwards.. just soft and hydrated. I’m sure there are comparable cleansers at a lower price point, but if you like SR and want something new, this is a solid option."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Malaysia,Very kind to skin,This Sunday riley cleanser has no foam and very gentle to your skin so for those who are entering 30s you guys should use this face cleanser because it doesn’t make your skin feel tight after washing it and it doesn’t strip your skin which is a very very good and safe to use. my mother has been using it for almost 2 weeks now she can see that her skin is getting better and not drying anymore so it’s really helpful
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Malaysia,surprisingly great for my skin ,"Bought this product via recommendation by one of Sephora’s staff in KK ( Imago) . And she was right about it. It doesn’t strip the face of natural oils , it has no foam and has a light clay smell. Skeptical at first but now it shall be my go to always since my redness and acne has calmed down . "
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Philippines,good,"Does not cause any irritation on my sensitive/dry/skin.

Got this less 25% off on sephora’s sale. Great value for money. Will definitely re-purchase. "
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,"Not for dry skin, perhaps for oily",Not for dry skin. I didn't notice right away but woke up with peeling dry patches. Perhaps for oily skin this would be just fine. But yay for being fragrance-free.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Malaysia,amazing product ,Amazing product. Clears the skin really well at the same time it does not strip the skin.  Quite pricy but worth the price!!! Overall would rate it 5/5. This product does not disappoint!!! 
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Malaysia,Doesn't seem to work very well on my skin,Saw a lot of good reviews about this product but it doesn't seem to be as good as it claimed. Quite disappointed. 
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Malaysia,Soothing and Calming ,"this cleanser has a gel-milk texture that feels quite light in your hands. I love this cleanser because while it starts out as a clear gel, it foams into a pale white lather that's easy to wash off and don’t makes my skin feel tight."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Malaysia,pulls out impurities ,"Pretty much getting rid of my makeup. But definitely need a gentle cleanser for double cleanse. My complexion gets better and my pores get smaller and it pulls out impurities without stripping my skin. It leaves my skin clean and dry because of my dry sensitive skin but not irritating at all. Did i like it, yes. Will i repurchase, it's pricey for a cleanser and i will need to switch to a more gentle cleanser for my sensitive skin. But it's a good product though but not for my thin barrier skin."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Good but average,It’s a nice cleanser that does the job not really nothing special. I think it was reformulated because it used to be better and came in a nicer looking bottle. I also notice it has formaldehyde releasing ingredients which I generally try to avoid.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,"Solid face wash, but you can probably find the same cleanse for less money."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Nice calming cleanser,Nice calming cleanser. I love the creamy texture and find it to be very soothing. I have used it daily for several months as a morning cleanser to balance my severely oily and acne prone skin. Would recommend to a friend.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Leaves skin feeling fresh and clean has helped my acne and minimizes the appearance of pores
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Malaysia,NICE,"After what seemed like an interminable amount of time, the product is now available for purchase. The products blew my mind, and I am completely taken aback by the level of quality. I really love the product. "
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Singapore,pricey,"Pretty pricey for the amount youre getting. However, it is really good and does not strip my skin of its moisture. cleanse my skin well and smells ok"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,It won’t remove remove makeup,"Even After rubbing it many times on my face and rinsed  it off ..A LOT of makeup reside was still there. I guess you have to use micellar water first to remove all makeup and then this product, but so what’s the point on spending so much on a cleanser?
I think this is good for a quick wash in the am or after workout but not to remove makeup. - not for me, I need something that does the job and leaves my skin soft.
The pros- it doesn’t over dry the skin."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Australia,Ms.,I couldn’t even use it because the hole in the tube was too small and the product barely came out. I reached out to Sunday Riley and they confirmed that it was their fault and they said they could send me a new one but they backed out because I lived in the Philippines and they couldn’t deliver here due to “shipping restrictions”.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Singapore,Pricey,"Pricey product but does little to your skin. Purchased this after good reviews online and by the promoter, but no efficacy on my skin, and does nothing much actually. "
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,The Best!,"Clean fresh scent. Doesn’t foam too much if you’re looking for something like that but it is so creamy and I feel like I have a baby smooth complexion immediately after use. I love this product because it calms the redness in my cheeks and it has helped combat my acne to the point where I go weeks without a zit at all. If you’re looking for a new staple in your skincare regimen, I strongly recommend ceramic slip."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Best cleanser,"I absolutely love everything Sunday Riley. I recently added this cleanser to my lineup and love everything about it!  Gentle enough to cleanse my eyes and open them strong enough to takeoff any mascara and eyeliner I had on during the day. I haven’t tried mixing it with my good genes for a flash facial yet but I plan on it. PS a little goes a long way and I mean a very little, smaller than a pea size."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,boooo..,"Man, I decided to splurge and remember liking this cleanser when this line first came out. I didn’t realize the formula and packaging changed. It’s nothing like I remember and is more of a gel consistency than a clay based cleanser. The packaging is so cheap especially at this price point. It got really gross and mildewy like no other cleanser container I’ve ever had before. So disappointed at the quality."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Deeply cleanses without over-stripping,Loveeee this cleanser. I have been using for several months now. It’s such a nice texture and I feel like it deeply cleans my skin but still leaves it feeling hydrated. A little goes a long way. I had a 1oz version before I bought the full size and the sample one literally lasted me 3 months. This is a staple in my skincare routine.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Singapore,great cleanser,This a pretty pricey cleanser so it has to live up to its worth. And it does! Doesnt leave my skin feeling stripped after using it which I love! I have dry skin but I’m sure it’s good for all skin types! I love how it doesn’t foam up too much as well because I hate cleansers that so that
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Absolutely love this cleanser! I got it with the night set and have fallen in love. My favorite part about it is how gentle on the skin it is and doesn’t dry my face out.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,silky clean,"I just finished washing my face with this cleanser for the first time and I already love it! It felt silky on my face while I was washing and now that my skin is dry, it feels extra soft and clean. Not sure about the long term effects but I already love it after one use."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Been using this for a couple years and it’s my fav cleanser.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,best cleanser I’ve ever tried!!,"Really amazing cleanser, I have noticed a big difference in the texture of my skin since I started using it! Really helped with my blackheads!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,The only way I find this cleanser to be effective is if I leave it on in the shower for 15 minutes and then wash it off. I only use it when I shower because otherwise I feel it leaves a residue. The results when using it in the shower are phenomenal. Just looking in the mirror I can tell a difference between using this cleanser. My skin just has a glow.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Singapore,A Changing Experience,"My skin seems to respond to this product differently depending on its state. I have acne prone combination skin and after using this product, my skin feels cleansed and soft most times while other times it feels very slightly tight. 

I first received a free sample of this and something about using it felt very luxurious. (Maybe the branding? Maybe knowing its full cost? Who knows) It made me enjoy washing my face so I bought the full sized to pursue that experience further. It does a good job at maintaining my skin barrier and didn’t break me out. 

My daily make up is fairly light and this does a good job of removing it if I skip my oil cleansing step on some days. "
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Singapore,disappointed ,"This is super mild and does not have the deep clean feeling it is supposed to deliver. For the price, it is hard not to feel like a ripoff. Very disappointed."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,"I like this cleanser a lot, but find it a bit drying during the winter months. I think it would be more ideal for oilier skin types. It smells great though!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,perfect for my oily/combo skin,"Hands down the best cleanser for my oily/combo skin . I’m sure this has the ability to be drying for very dry skin , but it works best for me . The heat and humidity leaves my skin feeling ick and grimey , this leaves me feeling clean and fresh"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Works great! Helps keep my pores minimized and doesn’t dry out my skin. Only downside is that it finishes very quickly for the price as it’s a thin consistency.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Hello soft and bright skin,I love this cleanser! I use it once a week to clean my pores and to soften my skin. Literally my skin is so smooth after use. This formula is a little drying so I follow it up with a good moisturizer (Origins Nightamins). I haven't noticed a film after use and my skin does not break out from it. I highly recommend this product.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Amazing,"I absolutely love this stuff. I wear a tinted SPF to the gym, since there’s a lot of windows there and a lot of sun where I live. I also wear a waterproof mascara and the Urban Decay All Nighter Setting Spray. When I get home to shower, I use a dime sized amount. It’s more than enough. When I tone after the shower, there is very little to no residue from what I had on my face. The waterproof mascara comes off so easily with it too. I just love it! I have combination skin, so it doesn’t make me dry on my t-zone. It does make my dry areas ashy and tight, but I just use a really good moisturizer and it’s fine."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,"Excellent, gentle cleanser","I wasn’t initially expecting much from this cleanser, then I tried it and WOW! It’s very gentle, so it’s a great daily cleanser for all skin types. Especially for anyone with acne, sensitive skin and/or redness. One use and I visibly saw a difference in my skin. It made my skin look a lot healthier, did NOT dry it out, and made my pores almost non-existent. Works even better with other Sunday Riley products like the CEO Glow oil, retinol night time oil and the brightening moisturizer. My complexion gets lots of compliments."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Decent cleanser,"It’s a decent cleanser for combo to oily skin. Granted, you’ll need a waterproof makeup remover to remove all stubborn and waterproof makeup. However, it leaves my face and neck clean (after using waterproof makeup first), balanced without any icky residue."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,My new ride or die!,My new ride or die! I got this to treat myself and I don’t think I can ever go back. This cleans so well without overly stripping my skin. I haven’t come across a cleanser this gentle but powerful. I’m really surprised this isn’t promoted as good for sensitive skin. Well worth the money. Definitely going to be a repeat purchase.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,flawless second-step cleanser,"This formula is incredible. I love the natural scents of the clay and the texture is very fluid but cushiony like you'd expect during a luxury facial. Before adding this to my routine, my skin oscillated between dry and oily (was so confused about which skin type I actually have), and this alone helped rebalance and maintain the peace. Inflammation and texture evened out and my breakouts lifted which was totally unexpected. Between this and increasing water intake (lol), my skin seriously looks retouched now.
I've seen some critiques about the packaging, and I can confirm that the brand fixed the orifice size so that one can dispense a proper amount."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,100% recommended!,So far it is the best cleanser I have found for my skin! Great product!
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Love this cleanser!,"Amazing Cleanser and literally know how well this works now that I have used it a year and during this whole crappy covid last year I was unable to get this and stopped using it every day to make it last and now I have repurchased it and my acne is clearing again. I suffer from a very oily T zone, and weird hormonal acne that turns cystic at times which can be super embarrassing at 34 haha, thankfully have this and can make sure to make it work fully now :)"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Unjustifiably expensive given products ineffective,"I have been an avid consumer of Sunday Riley for over 6 years now. To this day, I use their Good Genes lactic acid & their Luna Sleeping Oil. Incredible products that changed my skin.  I was looking for a different cleanser & came upon this, & trusting SR's products, I bought it. I was a bit hesitant given the price point, after all it's a cleanser but again, I trust their products. I have about 75% of the product left after using it consistently for nearly a month. Such a disappointment. I hate having to say that. 

I'm a male that doesn't wear makeup, but, this cleanser had a difficult time just removing my sunscreen & the common build up after a day. I guess you could use it as a double cleanse or even as a light cleanser in the AM but I can't say it's effective enough to use as a primary cleanser, especially for anybody wearing makeup. I've have drugstore cleansers that have a better ingredient list & are much more effective in cleansing my skin. This is just not worth the price point & I'm seriously wondering how it's still being justified after this much time on the market."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,AMAZING!!!!!!,I don’t know what life was before this face wash! It feels like heaven! I have dry skin and some oil due to medication but this evens that out. A loyal customer for life!
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,"Amazing cleanser that doesn’t strip the skin, feels super refreshing, and has even helped my acne! The only cleanser I use since I found it!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,a no-go,"Love the brand - Not this product. Didn’t feel clean after using, true for post workout, post gardening and even in the morning. I laugh when I use the product - keep re reading the same directions - thinking it’s something I’m doing wrong. Laughing keeps on healthy …so maybe there’s an upside!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,the one,"The cleanser I keep coming back to. It’s gentle but works hard, face feels so clean and balanced after using. Preps my skin perfectly for the remainder of my skincare routine. I have sensitive skin and this never betrays me"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Not for Dry Skin,"Made me breakout almost immediately, and leaves a residue after cleaning"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Solid Cleanser,"Love Love Love Love!! It’s a great cleanser, great price point and a little goes a long way. I’ve used this cleanser for 5 years and even when I try to change to something else it immediately gets returned and I always rebuy Ceramic Slip!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Singapore,Sunday Riley Clay Cleanser,"I love this cleanser because it gives a refreshing clean look after cleansing and keeps my skin taut. I used to have oily skin. I believe it balances the oil and keeps my face less oily nowadays. The best i hv had so far and I am sticking to this!

Sometimes it gives a dry feel but when i use it with SR face oil, it makes my skin feel supple again! "
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Malaysia,Ceramic Slip Cleanser,"It does a good enough job of cleansing my skin. It feels refreshing after using. The only thing I don't like about this is the texture of it, watery creamy. Be careful when you open the lid and use as it may spill out."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,"Great for my combo, sensitive skin","I have rosacea and combination skin, so I need something that will cleanse my skin deeply without irritating it. I love this cleanser. It doesn't have a lot of lather and feels like a cream cleanser, but the kaolin clay has adsorptive qualities that cleanse my pores well. It's fragrance-free and alcohol-free and doesn't irritate my skin at all. As long as they keep selling it, I'll keep buying it!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,All time favorite,"The cleanser that I always come back to. This has been my staple for nearly 3 years. I double cleanse and start with the Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil, then use this and my face feels clean and fresh after each time. As other reviews have noted, it’s a very gentle cleanser and a little goes a long way. If I’m running low and use a different cleanser, I always notice the difference in my skin. But not with this! I seriously cannot remember the last time I’ve had any breakout. I love using this in the shower as well!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Drying,"Got this as a sample. It talks a good game about deep cleaning without drying, but my skin got all patchy scales and unhappy tightness while using it. Maybe great for others, but for dry and eczema prone skin I'd choose something else."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Malaysia,suitable for combination skin ,"I found out that nonfoaming cleanser suits my combination skin best . So when I tried this cleanser ,  I love how it didn't leave my skin feel dry and it did a good job of cleansing my face . However after about almost 3 months using it , there was no wow effect  that I can found in another cleanser that I had used before thus even though it did a good job as a cleanser , I will not purchase it again taking into account the price  and the benefit.  "
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Doesn't actually clean the skin,This was suggested by a few different beauty store clerks so I finally bought it. Hardly any smell and really gentle. But after using for 2 months my skin was looking really dull and I realized it's just NOT cleaning my skin. My pores are clogged and I had a few break outs which is unusual. I switched to an herbivore soap and noticed an immediate improvement. I would only suggest this if you're also using some sort of brush or something to aid in cleaning the skin (which is too much for my delicate skin as that hurts me). Overall I was really disappointed.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Singapore,pretty good,"This product is quite nice, especially for congested and acne prone sensitive skin. I used to use this after I did chemical peels as I felt it didn't have many irritating acids like some of my other cleansers. "
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,"Excellent cleanser, not a makeup remover","Love love love this for dry skin! It’s a creamy gel formula and lathers without being too soapy. Cleanses skin without stripping it or leaving it feeling dry

Reminds me of the drunk elephant cleanser, very similar formulas but personally I prefer this one because it’s just a teensy bit more hydrating.

I will say: this is definitely not a makeup remover, I don’t know why it’s advertised as a makeup remover because I cannot see how this formula would be at all effective at removing makeup. 
It is however, incredibly effective as a second cleanser for those who double cleanse! I’d recommend double cleansing to anyone who wears makeup regularly, but any cleanser that isn’t oil based (a cleansing oil or cleansing balm) is not going to be effective as a makeup remover!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,a bit irritating,"I bought this after watching a celebrity video and didn’t find it suitable for sensitive skin. I’m prone to redness and this kind of exacerbated that and gave me rough texture. I liked the way it felt, and made my skin feel, but wasn’t happy with how my skin looked. It was slightly more drying than what I typically use, but nothing that wasn’t resolved with my serum and moisturizer."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,amazing product!,"An amazing product. Not harsh, very gentle cleanser. Been using for 2 months and have seen great results. I have combination skin and I have noticed that my skin does not have to overproduce the oils. Where have you been all my life!!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,nothing cleans out my pores better than this,"I’m surprised to see so many bad reviews for this product. I bought the Go To Bed With Me set so it came with a small ceramic slip. Honestly this is so underrated!! I have tried all cleansers out there - Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cleanser, PTR Anti-Aging Cleansing Gel, 3 from Algenist (Gentle Rejuvenating Cleanser, Ultimate Anti-Aging Melting Cleanser, Ultimate Anti-Aging Foaming Cleanser), FAB Pure Skin Face Cleanser, GlamGlow Supercleanse... you name it, I’ve tried it. Nothing clears out my pores like this does."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Great,I love it. I have sensitive skin and can’t even use some neutrogena products. This is gentle enough for my skin and doesn’t have a strong scent either.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,"This gentle cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean, but not stripped. I have very sensitive, oily skin and this product may just be my new best friend. With the first use, I noticed a significant improvement in oiliness at the end of a long day, which has always been a struggle for me. I think I can finally stop searching for my perfect cleanser!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,LOVE!,This is my new go-to cleanser for the winter! Creamy and foams once I add a little water... doesn't strip my skin. An all around fantastic product! Hopefully it works this well for summertime as well. Just wish you got more for the price but I'll continue purchasing regardless lol I didn't try the original formula because of the reviews stating it was drying... combo/oily skin should never get stripped or we overproduce oil to compensate. Very pleased with this version.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,"Creamy cleanser that never leaves my face dry, but always clean!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Singapore,ms,"With my problematic skin, I always needed some cleanser that removes dirt from clogged pores and retain natural oil. This does just that . Perfect for my skin"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Cleared up blackheads in one wash.,"I have been a Sunday Riley fan for about 3-4 years now, but have never wanted to spend the money on a face wash that cost more than $20. Welp, I was missing out and will continue to buy Ceramic Slip. Even if I don’t use it, but every other day I’d really dries out my pores in a good way. As a nurse having to were a mask none stop my face was breaking out more than usual; now it has cleared up even after a week of use."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,not sold on this one.,"I got this in a set with Good Genes.  While I am in love with Good Genes, this cleanser left me flat.  Nothing about it stood out for me.  it did not lather as nicely as some others, it did not leave me feeling clean, and because of the formula I'm unable to use it with my Foreo.   I bought the set for the Good Genes specifically and was hoping to like this as well, but I'm less than thrilled with it.  it wasn't awful, but that's the best thing I can say about it."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,wanted to love it so bad!,Does not clean my face completely. After washing for 2-3 minutes I am still left with makeup/dirt that wipes off on my towel when drying. It even broke me out horribly on my face and body since I used it as body wash as well! Wanted to love it but my face has suffered due to this product :-(
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Malaysia,Not for oily skin,This cleanser is too mild that it doesn’t remove the greasy oily on my face totally. I think people with dry skin or people who live in cold weather area might like it.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,"This face cleanser is effective and gentle. It’s not going to give you a squeaky clean feeling and you won’t get any tingly effects. The best thing about this is that it is so neutral— it cleanses effectively without stripping your skin, has minimal smell, and won’t shock your skin. It’s quiet efficacy can make you think it’s not doing it’s job, but I use a different cleanser when I travel (that comes travel size) and I promise my skin is less happy.

On that note- need a travel size of this!!!

Also- DO NOT be lazy and use leverage to close the lid while nozzle faces downward, in the shower or whatever... it will leak and make for a messy inside, and waste product as this is quite liquid. Always squeeze out the right amount, and then face the nozzle upward while closing. I also hold my finger on the nozzle once a week or two and run it under the shower to clean off any residue."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,new regimen essential,"I want to prefer a less expensive option than Sunday Riley, but I’m coming to find that their products are even better than my more expensive standards. This cleanser has jumped to the front of the line. I tried it first after I had already removed my makeup with the Claudalie cleansing oil (which I have loved to the exclusion of all others for years until this week). I liked how soft but ungreasy my skin felt with this cleanser. The next day I tried it as a makeup remover/cleanser, and that’s when I realized its true power. My skin feels clean, soft, moisturized, and there’s no trace of makeup, not even mascara. 

This product is locked into the rotation. The good news is that, as with other Sunday Riley products, a little goes a long way...though I have a feeling I’ll be washing my face more often now because it feels so good."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Singapore,Flawless,"I hadn't expected to love it this much but it really does work. My skin is smoother, clearer and radiant. Just wish Sunday would make their products more affordable. Will repurchase when I've finished, especially during sale season."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,This cleanser isn't bad but it isn't the best. I wouldn't recommend it as a makeup remover because it doesn't completely take off all my makeup. It doesn't foam up or lather up much like most cleansers I've used in the past but you also don't need a lot to cover your whole face. It's gentle enough that it doesn't break me out or strip my face. Very little to no fragrance. I have notice that it makes my skin feel super soft.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Singapore,Go-to daytime cleanser,"Love this cleanser because it doesn’t dry up my face! I usually use a stronger, more acidic cleanser for the nighttime and use this for lighter cleansing in the morning. Only downside is the product leaks out (too big an opening?) when placed upright, so I always lay it out sideways."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Get a sample first,"This cleanser is ok and it’s too expensive. I tried the original formula and felt the same way. I’m glad the formula and smell are different now but I’m not so sure it does anything for my skin. I don’t love the texture, it’s way too runny for my preference and I’m just not impressed. I will finish it and see how I feel about it but as of right now I would not repurchase"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Excellent Cleanser - Another SR Success!,"This cleanser is amazing. I am a fan of other Sunday Riley products, so I expected this to measure up to their other products. It has a mild scent, nothing too bad, and it's a simple gel formula. Don't expect it to foam up a lot. I used this in conjunction with my Clarisonic Mia cleansing brush and it cleans my skin and leaves it soft and supple, without feeling dry in any spots. I usually used Origins Checks and Balance, but I think this might replace that as my everyday facial cleanser. I use this in the morning and tea tree wipes in the evening, so I don't know how it does for taking off makeup, but I hear it can do the job."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Philippines,Amazing,"After using you’ll definitely feel your skin smooth, works well as stated. It is a bit pricey but a little goes a long way. I highly recommend this cleanser"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Love it!,Really enjoyed this cleanser. Removes all of the makeup and dirt from my face. Repurchasing!
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,"i do love love love this cleanser. it leaves my skin feeling amazing. and now that its not in that pump bottle that gets all gross i love it even more, though w. out the pumps i feel like i use more product than necessary based on the texture/viscosity of ceramic slip

the price point, however, knocks off a star. i can get almost as good, if not just as good of a cleanse with less costly products.. in most cases its a significantly larger volume of product for $10-15 less."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,ummm wow,"Okay I was turned off to SR for a loooong time after their scandal. I happened to get a sample of this in a skincare set and decided to use it one day just to see what it was like. I wish I never did because I FELL IN LOVE. I’ve never ever ever used a cleanser that made my skin feel both clean and ultra soft. It was like I had no texture on my face. I am so shocked, i truly can’t believe it. As with any skincare, my recommendation is not to rush and buy since everyone’s skin is different. Get a sample and see for yourself!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,gentle yet effective,"i hadnt fallen in love with a cleanser in a very long time. the only type of cleansers i prefer are gentle ones but the problem with gentle cleansers is that sometimes your skin doesn’t feel clean afterwards or they dont improve the quality of your skin whatsoever. this cleanser is gentle yet effective. It leaves my skin feeling clean but never stripped, and i’ve noticed my skin texture has become smoother. my fave!!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Absolutely love! Adding this to my nightly skin routine has helped keep my face acne free!
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,omg! In Lovvvvve!!!,"I read somewhere that there is an “older formula” for this cleanser. I recently purchased a tube of this that came in a set with Good Genes, so I’m assuming that I’ve been using the newest formula.
Uuummmm....... I can’t WAIT to go back to the store to get full sizes of both products.
My skin is so incredibly soft. I use this facial cleanser every morning, and sometimes at night if I’m not lazy and just use my Oil of Olay wipes. It has a very smooth texture and when I rinse with warm water as directed, my skin feels smooth and moisturized. My skin type is combination (def leaning more towards oily). My skin usually becomes dry and tight if a cleanser is too harsh, but not with this stuff. I am pleasantly surprised! I follow up with the Good Genes and undoubtedly, my mature, acne prone skin has improved. I can’t get over how smooth and clear my face is. And I experienced zero issues with sensitivity or breakouts or anything weird. It’s been about a week of use...
For reference, I have been using Differin gel (and Differin scar serum) at night for the past 6 months (love love love), so I think this routine is benefitting my skin in ways that make me super excited to see how things’ll look in a couple more months. I want all old acne dark spots gone for good!!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Awful,"This product was a giant fail for me. I can't even describe the way my skin felt after using it other than to say it felt very ""icky"", uncleansed, and worse than it felt prior to washing. It gets so much love and though I know that SR has gotten in trouble for writing fake reviews, I can't help but think most of them are real and I am clearly in the minority. I don't know what they are getting that I seem to be missing. I've used many cleansers from drug store to luxury brands, and this one ranks at the bottom. I won't say don't try it, but based on my own experience, I'd recommend getting a sample first."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,"REBALANCED MY SKIN, J'ADORE","I just moved back to the USA after living in Europe for the last 3 years. I found that in NYC, my skin was not responding to my EU products - it became oilier, and I was breaking out. I saw an immediate difference after just one use of this cleanser - my skin immediately balanced out and my breakouts were gone by the next day. It is not drying, totally neutral, and very pleasantly suds around my face for a generous cleansing effect. Absolutely love this product and WILL buy again."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Singapore,Mdm,"Bought this for my sister love this. She has a very sensitive, acne-prone. She has been finding products that work for her skin type that aren’t too harsh, and some are not effective enough. This somehow strikes the perfect balance. She has bought some others for acne, pores, brighten her skin and moisturiser too. Definitely be back for more. "
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Amazing,I orginally got this product as a free sample and then I bought the full size bottle. A drop goes a long way. My face feels so clean and smooth after using.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Amazing!! I can feel a difference just after a few days!
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,New & Now Faithful SR Fan!!,"A wonderful Sephora employee who is also a Sunday Riley rep turned me on to this and the Power Couple set yesterday while in the store. (I usually shop online) I’ve been using everything Drunk Elephant, I have like 75% of their products and while I’ve noticed a change in my skin, it was nothing like the change I’ve seen from 2 days of this cleanser used in conjunction with the Power Couple set! I’m going back to the store ASAP to buy Tidal and the Auto Correct eye cream as well! I’m totally sold on Sunday Riley!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,NEW FORMULA IS AMAZING,"After trying the old formula I took a break from Ceramic Slip cleanser because it was so drying. After trying more Sunday Riley products I decided to try the new formulation of the Ceramic Slip, AND I AM AMAZED. This formula is the polar opposite of the old formula it does not dry my skin out the smell is great and the texture of the cleanser is so satisfying."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Love it!,I love this product. My skin was becoming dry and I stopped into Sephora to find a new face wash. I'm very low maintenance so I'm always skeptical. I have been using this for over a year now and it has made a significant difference in how how I feel about taking care of my skin. Great for sensitive skin.
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,HUNTYYY!!,"So i walked into Sephora just-a-browsin, and honestly, i wasn’t expecting to buy anything, but i remembered I needed a new facial cleaner, and decided to ask what was their best seller. one of my main facial concerns are my pores. i don’t like to see them. the associate led me to Sunday Riley Ceramic Slip and said,” You’ve got to try this.” Alright. I bought this and the mattifying toner. I got home, washed my face with it, toned and moisturized, and went to sleep. I woke up today, and YALL, i ain’t lying, my pores shrunk. It was enough where i could notice. My face feels so weightless and not clogged up. I’ll give it a week and come back and update my review, but so far chile, i’m here for it."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,"TERRIBLE, hard to clean afterwards........................."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Good stuff love it,I love this cleanser. I have oily acne prone skin and this is so gentle and cleared up my face. Forever fav I’m going on my third bottle
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Terrible,"I’m usually a huge fan of Sunday Riley products so I’m so appalled at my experience with this one. I have combination skin, and for the past couple years I’ve been using the glam glow supercleanse cleanser. It’s worked really well with my skin and I’ve never had a problem with it, but I decided it was time to switch things up and try something new. After reading all the great reviews on this, I thought it would work great with my skin. I was so wrong. I’ve never seen my skin break out like this. After 3 uses, i now have huge, painful, almost cystic looking spots all over my face. Super disappointed in this."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,Malaysia,Makes My Skin Smooth Like Ceramic,"This is my second tube. I have never thought that a cleanser could have a good effect on skin. Before discovering this product, I have never sticked to any cleanser. I used a cleanser only to clean my face from dirt and oil. But this product has changed my perception. It makes my skin plump and smoother, just like its name 'ceramic slip'. Even my friends noticed my skin improvement. I'm gonna stick with this product as long as they don't change the formula."
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,Best face wash out there!,"Love this face wash! My face has been so clear and soft since I have started using it. It’s does a great job of cleansing but does not dry my skin out at all. I have tried many cleansers from drunk elephant, fresh, Clinique, Tatcha and this one is the absolute best!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser,USA,amazing,Amazing cleanser! Gets rid of all the gunk in your face and leaves it super hydrated and glowing. My boyfriend complimented how nice my skin looked and even bought one for himself because of how impressed he was.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Australia,Maybe best for very oily skin ,I have combination skin with an oily t-zone. I find this too drying/my skin feels too stripped after I’ve used it. The scent and foam consistency is nice though. 
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,great scent ,"Love the foamy bubbling effect, great rose scent. Would consider repurchasing! It doesn’t hydrate as well as other used but still decent and I use it alternately "
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Singapore,cleansing foam,have purchased all different kinds of Rose scented Fresh product and so far I am really happy with my purchase! smells so good and product is satisfyingly amazing on my skin.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Ok cleaser,"As with many foam cleanser, this one left my skin slightly dryer. It also leaves a slight stinging sensation on my skin. One pump would be more than enough to clean. "
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Ms,"ok.  Smell is good, cleanse well also but is extremely little.  Gone in less than 3 weeks. I feel is Not worth it.                                         ."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Australia,Wish it could be a bigger bottle! ,A really good cleansing foam. It is very gentle. The skin is not dry after used. Just wish the bottle could be a bit bigger. It didn’t last for long. But absolutely loving it. And the rose smell is amazing! 
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Singapore,still prefer the other rose products,"Disappointed the rose smell isn’t like their other rose products which I love the smell of, not super foamy but overall not bad! Would not repurchase though."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Soso Product,"Smell was not very pleasant, product considered little for the price. didnt like the feel after the wash. will not repurchase again maybe will try the soy one instead"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,New Zealand,Gentle on the skin ,I have sensitive skin and this product doesn't leave my skin red or damaged. 
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Disappointed,i love rose scented stuffs and i had high hopes on this cleanser . ..but i was so disappointed.. it is not worth the price.. i have dry combination skin. i didnt feel hydrated at all. this cleanser really did not do anything for me.. not worth the price at all. i loved the foamy nature of this cleanser but other than that i felt i just wasted my money
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Good to use but pricey,"Good to use but a bit pricey. Like the bubble when using it and it cleanses and moisture my face. It used up quick though it is 150ml, not affordable for me to repurchase."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,New Zealand,  FRESH  Rose Cleansing Foam,"This rose Cleansing Foam is good to use at night. After removing my make, I will always love to use this cleansing foam. "
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Australia,not for me,"Fresh products generally work well for me but this didn't agree with my skin. I found it drying and irritating, so could use maybe once a week, rather than as a daily cleanser. It's a shame because the moisturizer in this range is great."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Australia,Ms,Left my sensitive skin try at times in winter. Overall a great product and will be buying again. Also got this as a present for my sister and she loves it. 
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,"I really love this. Some people it's too mild and has minimal effects, but it works for me! I love the lathering foam texture, it's super soft and refreshing. It also has a very nice scent and it removes all of my mild makeup. I love it."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Singapore,cleansing foam,fresh cleansing foam is recommended by 1 of my friend mentioning that this is good for oily n combi skin she highly recommended for night use after makeup removal 
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,It cleans well when I don’t have heavy makeup. Good for morning face wash. Need to put toner after use
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Australia,Ms,Rose Cleansing Foam with soothing rosewater is a daily cleanser for all skin types that rejuvenates and hydrates the skin for a healthier-looking complexion. *Benefits* The soap-free formula dissolves dirt and everyday impurities without stripping the skin of essential moisture.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Good to use during morning ,"Love the foam form of the cleanser, it can clean my face so well although it’s just foam. Prefer to use the product during night and morning. Will consider to reorder."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,"I bought this about a week ago and I love the scent and how soft and gentle it is to your face, I use about 2 pumps at night to take my makeup off and 1 pump in the mornings, I’ve Lao made the mistake of opening my eyes while putting the foam on my face and around the eyes but it didn’t burn! It also does not strip your natural oils, I’ve had others face washing products that stripped it off and my skin would feel really dry and bad afterwards this one does not do that"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Ms,"I have always preferred a foaming cleanser than liquid cleanser. Works well but doesn’t remove makeup easily. The scent is just nice, not too overpowering."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,cleansing ,"It might be a good product but not for me because It’s not suitable for my skin.
I feel it’s so dry after I’ve use this cleanser, especially my nose part.
"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,New Zealand,Ms,"The foam smell nice and fresh, but the foam is too thin and light not enough bubbles. Not strong cleaning, only suitable to clean in the morning, not at night, may not purchase again"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,Lightly Scented Expensive Foam,"Pretty light foam. For my oily skin, it took a couple pumps for me to feel clean. It was definitely good for my sensitivities, although it did have a very subtle smell to it. Kind of pricey for minimal results. It didn’t really take off makeup too well either. And it’s not a good amount of product based on price and how much you use in one go. After a while I just forgot I even bought it. Didn’t make a big impression on me."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,Didn’t feel like it worked as well as other cleansers I’ve tried plus it was really strongly scented.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,Another great product from Fresh,"This is pleasant... smells like rose and cucumber, creates a nice lathering foam, is gentle and mild enough to use often. It goes really well with the fresh rose hydrating cream, which I love!"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Canada,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,"Mild and not stimulating
Basic morning face cleansing washes will not feel dry
Low cost-effective"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,super mild and soothing,"I had the impression that foaming cleansers will dry my skin (I have dry skin type). Which later tried this for about 2 days, I started liking this product already. It gives me this soothing and calming sensation. Kinda have this love-hate relationship with the smell lol. For me, 1 pump is enough already (actually it is a lot of foam so maybe can make it half a pump to save up the product). Post-cleansing, I can feel my skin plumps and looks radiant already. Will consider repurchase "
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Australia,Truly balancing! ,Love at first wash! It’s better than soy face cleanser according to me for my sensitive blemish prone skin. Soy cleanser is way too gentle as compared to this baby which cleanses like a dream while hydrating the skin. Smells lovely too. Will buy again. 
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,New Zealand,The best cleanser,"I have always loved Foaming cleansers but this one especially is by far the best i’ve ever tried! as it does all the work and does not over dry my skin like the precious cleansers i used in the past. Will purchase again for sure. And also looking forward to more of Fresh Rose edition products, Totally worth the money. Very impressed!"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Australia,my 3rd bottle!,smells and feels beautifully on the skin. I prefer this cleanser over the soy one as this feels more hydrating. Loving the foam texture and it is a experience everytime i use it!
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,I double cleanse with this after using a cleansing balm. I normally love Rose scented products however this was on the strong side and it felt a bit stripping. I can usually use a light moisturizer after my second cleanse but I had to use my winter moisturizer with this one. My skin is normal to dry. Unfortunately this wasn’t for me.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,Totally recommend,Great for dry and sensitive skin! Bought my second bottle today after finishing using one full size!
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,"Hydrating, balancing, works with your routine","This is another holygrail cleanser for my oily-condition skin. If I'm going for a double cleanse, this is gentle enough to use as a second, but it’s still effective on its own with a toner, serum, moisturizer, etc. . To be comparative, it's very hydrating, though a small notch down from its sibling, Fresh Soy Milk cleanser (not the gel), and very lathery. Its properties promote a clean (but not stripped), toned complexion in my case, which is often the opposite with foam formulations (for me). As always, abide by the directions. Do not start on wet skin. Begin dry, then after a minute or so, add a little water and rinse. This is also great for routines that manage acne because it cleans, balances, and hydrates the skin, which makes it interchangeable for me. But beyond prevention via maintaining a healthy complexion, I’m unsure as to how resourceful it is, alone, for treating acne. I’ve haven’t experienced irritation in the least, so if you’re willing to try it for that condition, irritation appears to be a low risk, and that’s the best case when trying something new."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,great for rosacea,Been using this for years. Best face wash for rosacea. Even though it’s super gentle it still removes all dirt and make up. It’s smells beautiful. Worth every penny.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,It does what it says.,I have oily to combination skin. This product cleans the face without feeling any tightness afterwards. A full pump uses A LOT of product so I will use half a pump. That’s adequate for my skin. That’s pretty much what it does. 
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,Super stripping,"It definitely cleans, but it also strips my skin of everything. If I don’t use a heavy moisturizer, I’ll have dry patches within the hour"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,"Great for day to day, not so great at removing a full face of makeup if that's what you're looking for."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,Makeup remover,"I really like this product. My face is very finicky on a daily basis which makes using products hard. This cleans all my makeup off, leaves my skin feeling clean and never dry.  I give this thumbs up on a good face cleaner."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Love it!,I love this facial cleasing foam. It really refreshing and cleanse my face well after a long day. It is also smell good and I love that it is in foam form.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Rose cleansing foam,"Love the mild rose scent... Always a huge fan of anything with roses. Gentle for my everyday use.... Already my 4th bottles, still loving it....Not cheap but definitely worth buying..."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Singapore,mdm ,I love this Rose cleansing foam .. is refreshing and the smell of the rose make my day each time I used ! I like FRESH products for their natural ingredients ! Is not cheap for the volume if u wash frequently but it is very effective product 
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,United Kingdom,Amazing!!! A must have!,"Absolutely fantastic! The best cleanser I have ever tried- its refreshing, cleansing, and revitalising! Plus it smells absolutely beautiful! 
Also I'd like to comment on the sophistication of the packaging- you can so tell it has been packed with love and care! Thank you!"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Singapore,I love this!!,I am a huge fan of foam cleansers and this is on the top of my list. I have sensitive skin and this works so well for me! I love how it leaves my skin feeling really clean. The scent is very mild and doesn’t irritate my skin at all. I’m onto my 3rd bottle and I will definitely be repurchasing this! 
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Works for me!,"I loove this cleanser. I'm on my second bottle and it is really gentle on my skin. My skin is quite sensitive and I used to get red patches on my face which is like abit itchy when I used facial cleansers from other brands but didn't have that when using this one, so yay! "
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,love the smell,Love the smell and really gives a feeling of total cleanse (some cleanser just make you feel like your face is still greasy after the wash but not this!) always have been into foam cleanser and this is by far one of the better ones that I have used
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Australia,Gentle but not for Oily Skin,"I like rose scent, but my hubby doesn’t, maybe men has a different nose. It is convenient to have foam with only one press. This product is more for normal to dry skin as the foam is soft and melts fast. But it is gentle."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Australia,Gentle ,"This is perfect if you want something gentle to cleanse with. In way of cleaning and removing dirt, there’s better products out there. If you want something more powerful try Fresh Soy Cleanser instead. "
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Canada,MEDIOCRE,Not sure if this does anything to be honest. It's a hit or miss which sucks because I LOVE all things Fresh. It does soothe the skin but I don't think I'd rely on this as a cleanser itself.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Slightly Drying,"For a lover of all mild rose scents, this was a delight to use. A complete sensorial experience however, slightly drying. Would recommend the Soy Cleanser instead for a better price point and its formulation. (Though currently and probably will forever be using Krave’s Matcha Hemp cleanser 🤓)"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,LOVE IT,SMELLS SO NICE! Leaves your skin nice and fresh! I would definitely recommend this for all skin types!
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,An okay product,"I recently bought this wash and the first impression was that it smelled very refreshing, I’m an oily skin type and the wash left my skin clean and smooth but I honestly don’t think it’s meant to attack those oily pores but mostly to  wash off any dirt on the surface. Plus, it takes several pumps of the foam to get a good cleansing cause it washes off too quick, I’ve used it two nights and a quarter of the bottle is already done,  so if you want something worth what you pay for this won’t be your go to"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,Great cleanser,"I love this cleanser! It leaves my skin feeling clean, but not tight and dry. Perfect for dry/sensitive skin."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Canada,To light for my complex skin,"This cleanser didn’t do much for me. It was way to light. I didn’t have that clean face satisfaction after washing my face. I felt like there was way more build up left on my skin.

I used the fresh soy cleanser and that was amazing for my skin. I use all fresh products and wanted to try something new but this product is a no for me."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,"I really like this product! The scent is just so nice and I never broke out or anything! The only reason I didn't rate it a full 5 stars is it didn't really do any of the things that the description of the product said it would. Nevertheless, it's still a high-quality product and better than the soy cleanser in my opinion."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Australia,Love!!!,Love this cleanser - leaves my face feeling perfectly cleansed and the scent is beautiful! Definitely recommend this fresh product from the rose range.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Australia,Rose Foaming Cleanser,"I enjoyed using this product. I really liked the scent, but it was a bit drying. My skin is combination and I wanted something to remove the excess oils but not strip the skin which I found a little bit. Overall the product wasn't that bad, but I wouldn't use it again"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,,good cleanser for morning ,"I have Chanel cream cleanser for night cleaning but I want to buy a gentle one for morning. I Choose this product because it’s very gentle but at the same time it still a good one to clean skin! The only reason I give 4 stars is because it’s expensive for 120ml
"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,,Rose Face Wash,Its a magic face wash .... its in liquid form in bottle but when we pump it it turn to foam form....expensive but really worth it....will suggest to others..... i really love it..
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,"I was so excited to try this but my face did not feel clean, the scent was irritating, and I broke out afterward."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,"GREAT, but doesn't last long","okay, so I am loving this. I have dry, acne prone, aging skin. it cleanses great, feels great afterward, and my skin went from being pimple city to basically clear in the last month (I also use trader Joe's tea tree fw so I can't completely credit this for clearing my acne but I can say with certainty it HAS HELPED) the one and only problem I have is that I went thru this whole bottle in 5 weeks. washing 2x a day. that's freaking crazy. I've had travel size stuff last me almost that long!! I considered trying a different product that I could get more longevity out of, but when it comes down to it, my skin has completely cleared in the last 5 weeks. so this combo is working for me and I can't bring myself to change up a good thing."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,"I love this product, it is super soft and the perfume is very nice."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,performance = good. smell = rotten roses.,The performance of the cleanser is fine. Not drying. Works as a perfect second cleanse. But the scent. It’s atrocious. Like rancid roses. It’s enough that I can’t bring myself to keep using it.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,"Light, moisturizing deliciousness","I never really write reviews, but had to for this one. I LOVE this product - i have been looking for a foaming face cleanser that doesnt strip my skin of moisture (especially during the dry winters). This literally feels like a buttery goodness on your face. The foam is light and feels so soft on the skin (where other foaming face washes feel rough and like its stripping skin of moisture).  It also smells delicious, which is a perk! I look forward to using this every night!"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,Gentle enough for my sensitive skin!,"I fell in love with their soy cleanser and thought I would give this a try. It has a great smell and feels nice when I am washing my face with this. I have sensitive skin and break out easy so I spend more on skin products like cleansers and foundations. This isn't too expensive, makes my skin feel smooth and clean, not tight and it doesn't give me a rash or breakout. I would buy this again."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Canada,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,"I have super dry and sensitive skin, especially in the winter season. This face wash did not irritate my skin in anyway or strip my face of its natural moisture. Very pleased with it."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,Best Face Cleanser Possible for Sensitive Skin!,"This is the best face cleanser possible for sensitive skin. After months of searching, I finally found something that works with my skin and gives it a balanced, brighter look. I highly recommend it!"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,Balances Skin,"I've tried many cleansers from drugstore to very high end. I really like this product. It left my face clean and makeup free with zero tightness. Balances the skin nicely, which is what you want in a cleanser. The light rose scent is lovely, if you like rose. Highly recommend."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Canada,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,Great product. Nice and soft skin after I used it and very gentle on my sensitive skin. I love it so much that I will buy the moisturizer as well next time.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,,very very mild cleansing ,"This product is too mild for combination skin user imo. Price wise, it is slightly expensive as this one bottle could only last you for roughly 1.5 month. Nonetheless, it is a good product if one is looking for a mild cleanser. "
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,,gentle,this is gentle and easy to use for me. a pump of the product is enough to cleanse my face and leave me feeling refreshed. it doesn't leave my skin feeling tight like some.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,Don't recommend it,"I've been using this cleansing foam for a couple of months, and, even if there's still product left, I stopped using it. With other cleansers, I never had so much breakouts. Also, my skin was super dry at some places, making it red and sensitive. The only thing I appreciated was the consistency of the foam, which was nice to apply, but I needed a great amount of it to cover my entire face..."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,,Love this cleanser!,This is my second bottle of this cleanser. Smells very good and cleans well without making the skin dry and tight. Love that it’s foam based too! Ideal for morning cleansing!  😍
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,Best Refreshing Feeling,I'm a fan of Fresh products anyway so when I stumbled across this cleansing foam I was pumped! The rose scent to the product isn't overwhelming but you can tell its there and its pleasant! I felt very refreshed after using this in the mornings and it helps me wind down in the evenings. Great product and size for the price! Definitely worth the purchase!
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,Must have along with Fresh Soy wash,My all time favorite.  I have been using it for about 3 years now.  Great product.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,good cleanser,This is a good cleanser but I don’t feel like you get enough product for the price. Plus it’s *just* a good cleanser. There’s not a whole lot magical about it besides it being nice for sensitive skin. If it either was a little cheaper or came in a bigger bottle I’d repurchase
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Canada,Luxe and Loving It,"If you love their rose line-up, you'll likely love this cleanser too. Sometimes we have days where we are lazy with our skincare (no, just me then?) and to have something that's super easy and where the smell is something to look forward to... is nice. It's a total luxury and non-necessity, and the amount you get for the price seems a little much, but I don't regret buying it! My face feels soft and clean after using it. I have combination skin but my T-zone is incredibly oily and I would say that I feel this does a good job of balancing the skin. Will this cleanser solve all of your skin problems? I'm not sure, but the process of finding out is going to smell and feel delightful. :)"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,,little drying ,"A beautiful cleanser leaves the skin feeling really clean. However, I did feel it was a little drying which is why I have now switch to the gel one. However after moisturiser didn’t feel
Dry at all"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,Not super functional for makeup wearers,I like the ease of a foam cleanser (and it smells so good!) but I don’t find it particularly cleansing. It will not strip your makeup off so you do have to double cleanse with this. Also not particularly moisturizing. Over all it’s just a meh product.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,,great for oily skin,"i noticed ever since using this product, my skin is no longer oily as it used to be. i don't need to use matte powder to touch up during the day. the product itself smells great and is gentle on your skin. your skin may appear to look dry (it doesn't feel dry) afterwards but for me, i'd prefer it to be that way. i use this day and night. 
the pump is easy to use (i use 2 pumps each time as a minimum). it can have a watery consistency if you don't use enough pumps so thats a down side. "
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,,I'm on my 4th one now,"Don't think I'd ever stop buying this product. It smells fantastic (and the scent lasts for a while after use), and it's really gentle on your skin.
I use this twice a day, each time I use two pumps - unfortunately this product gets used up quickly. I wish they sell larger sizes!"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,,Was ok,"Always knew how highly raved Fresh products are, so wanted to try out something from their range. This cleanser is rather light and non-drying but it’s not densed rough, I had to press 3 full pumps otherwise it seem diluted when I rub over the face. Smell kinda too strong for my liking. "
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,,Great product,"It's my daily go to cleanser. Does a great job in prepping the skin for the other beauty steps. The ready foam feature is also a great plus point, since it means I can skip the step of having to work up a lather on my own. Highly recommended."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,,:) ,"Smells wonderful and looks pretty. I like how it’s a foam, very different. It’s very gentle obviously and isn’t harsh at all. I like it as a daily cleanser but will also need a scrub to week a few times a week as well as this foam won’t remove dead skin "
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Canada,Good for Sensitive Skin,"I've been using this cleanser for 5-6 months now and am on my second bottle. It cleanses well without removing too much hydration from my dry and sensitive skin. I don't know it it really does much too improve the texture or any of my issues like clogged pores, but my skin feels nice afterwards and it hasn't caused any irritation. A good buy overall if you have sensitivity concerns."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,,Fresh Rose Foam Cleanser,"I love the whole Fresh Rose range!! Smells good and not too overwhelming. This cleanser is very mild and it's not drying, recommended for sensitive skin too!"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,"I really do like the products from fresh, but they are a bit expensive for what they are. I found it best to use this with dry hands on a dry face, and then wet your hands if you needed to. Applying this on a wet face didn’t work well for me. It smelled good, wasn’t nourishing (but wasn’t drying), and I left my skin feeling really nice (only a little tight). I ended up using 3 pumps, which may have been a little too much. This product is great, but not for the value; if you’re someone who’s going to use it everyday, you’re going to run out of it quickly. I got this as part of my travel skincare bag. I’m glad I got this during the 20% off sale, because the price, for the quantity, is way too much."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,Permanent add to my skincare routine,I fell in love with the rose cream and was stoked when Fresh came out with a Rose Cleansing Foam.  The smell is heavenly and it is super gently but also thoroughly cleans my sensitive skin.  I actually get excited to wash my face!
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,,Love,"I love this product, like all FRESH products! I usually find foam cleansers too drying but this is gentle and effective and smells incredible!!! Sometimes rose scents can be overpowering or old fashioned but this is fresh and clean. "
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,I have this product in my makeup kit for cleansing clients skin before application. It is a nice genital cleanser though fragrant. The pump foams the cleanser into you hand making it easy to leather with out dampening the skin. I like this product because it suits all skin types with out leaving the skin felling striped.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,Canada,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,"It makes your skin smell like roses and leaves it refreshed, and the foam formula makes it very gentle on the skin. I am still waiting for results on my skin because i just started using it."
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,Hard Pass,Do not like this product at all. Doesn't leave your face feeling clean.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,Loved the soft foam which gently cleans and leaves fresh feeling and pleasant scent.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,I highly recommended this product is totally light and clean perfectly your skin.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,,One of my favourites ,I love this product. I find that it has helped me take off all my makeup without leaving anything behind. It is very simple to use and fun since it is a foam product. 
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,,Can be a little drying,"This foaming cleanser is good, but it can be a little drying to the skin. It removes some make-up so I usually use an oil cleanser prior. Definitely not suitable for dry skin. "
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,,Great purchase! ,This rose foaming cleanser is fun to use and smells really good! It's not drying at all and leaves the skin feeling clean. I'll definitely purchase this item again once I run out of it. 
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,,rose cleansing foam,This is the best foam cleanser I have used.  Removes make up and daily skin oil without drying out the skin. Would recommend to anyone with combination skin.
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,FRESH Rose Cleansing Foam,"Used to use caudalie foam cleanser and wanna try something new. This fresh one works fine but it smells terrible, kinda fishy on my face... I tried not to breathe when I was using it"
FRESH-Rose Cleansing Foam,USA,Fresh Product,Awesome Scent and cleanses without stripping your oils from your face.
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Australia,good everyday face wash,"I bought this because clinique discontinued the cleanser I used to use. this one is good at taking off most light to medium makeup, and has some gentle exfoliating bits - almost like a sand texture."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,New Zealand,love!,"How have I ever lived without this!!! Been using this for over 2 weeks and my skin is brighter and smoother! It is so gentle, I have dry skin but also clogged pores and this has really helped my skin."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,USA,A Keeper!,I really like this product! I use in the shower and like that it is dual purpose - cleanser and exfoliated.  I have sensitive skin and have had zero reactions when using it.

CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,USA,Great for mature skin,I am in my late 50’s and I absolutely love this product. I was looking for a change because let’s face it our skin as we get older is not what it once was. So happy I tried this!
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Canada,Good Cleanser,"A majority of the ingredients used in his cleanser is pretty beneficial for the skin. I personally liked that the liquid was a clear odorless gel which is perfect for anyone sensitive to fragrances. The beads inside the formula and the packaging is environmentally friendly. The only con I have is that I thought that the beads were still a little hard on my skin which I am worried it may cause microtears, definitely isn't a cleanser to be used daily though."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Singapore,Love It,"I love it!!! Will buy it when it is in stock again.
Makes my skin really clean ✨️ 😌
I love using it at night after an oily make up removing process. It makes my skin squeaky clean and ready for my night time skin care routine. 
But because it is so cleansing, people with dry skin should be cautious and start your skincare asap, don't wait for your skin to shrivel up."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Malaysia,good but to pricey,"this cleanser is good, clean and fresh but to pricey,  it had gentle scrub but I think not suitable for acne and dry skin, suitable for oily skin and to remove blackheads "
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Canada,Amazing,This is an amazing product. It creates good foam once you apply on face. After using this skin feels cleaned deeply and it makes skin glowing and shiny
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Australia,Good texture scrub,"quite liked this scrub, it was the goldilocks of scrubs- not to rough and not too soft, just right! it was unscented and I did not love the natural product scent, needs a mild smell imo"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Canada,Destroyed skin barrier,"It does nothing. I have Very oily skin and wanted to get rid of blackhead and other bildup using this product but did not work for me at all. Instead it destroyed my skin barrier, I used it twice a week ."

CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Singapore,Better,Was using the scrub and the 7-day scrub. However felt like both products changed and didn’t work so well as they use to. Decided to buy this scrub for a change. Definitely more particles in the product than the normal scrub but the particles are not as rough and coarse as the 7-day scrub. Much better than the other 2 scrubs. Doesn’t dry out skin after usage.
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Malaysia,great,"A very good and soft daily washing facial scrub that cleans your skin gently and leaves it feel fresh and soft, especially for my oily skin. I must say it ‘a happy purchase’. "

CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Canada,Clinique All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution - 150ml,super cooling and refreshing def my fav of all time
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Canada,Best facial scrub out there,"Clinique's All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly is the best scrub that I'ver ever used. I used to use Clinique's Pep Start scrub before it was discontinued and it was the best I've ever used, but this scrub is better than it's predecessor because it doesn't contain any dye unlike the original Pep Start which had a brownish dye. I have sensitive skin and it's difficult for me to find skincare products that don't irritate and beak out my skin. This scrub doesn't irritate my skin and it doesn't make me break out. It washes my skin clean and it feels clean. This scrub is a 2 in 1 cleanser and exfoliator which means that you don't have to use a toner after because the exfoliating part is already in the scrub hence in the name cleansing + exfoliating. Next, I moisturize with Clinique iD Dramatically Different Hydrating Clearing Jelly + Active Cartridge Concentrate for Imperfections. The combination of this scrub with Clinique's iD Dramatically Different Hydrating Clearing Jelly makes my skin clear, healthy and not irritated. This scrub is worth giving it a try and try it with the clearing jelly. I'm on my second tube of this scrub. Take it from someone who has struggled with break outs and skin irritation, this scrub works."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Canada,I'm a believer!,"received this yesterday and I'm already obsessed! I used it last night, followed by the overnight mask.  my skin looked visibly healthier this morning and my pimple is almost gone.  my Teenage son is starting to break out a little lately, so I used this on him today and within an hour his pimples looked like they were healing and disappearing! I couldn't believe how quickly it worked!"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Australia,Excellent product ,"I literally Love it🤩🤩🤩 It works magically 🪄 on my face, leave my face clean and smooth. I would buy it again❤️ and I am planning to buy it for my mum and sister as well. "

CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Malaysia,it worked better than my other exfoliating gel,It remove dull skin and impurities. the feeling of the jelly and beads when u massaging your face is so satisfying. u felt very cleaning and fresh after it 
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,USA,It removes blackheads and dirty oily face!,"I wash this face cleanser in shower, made my skin super CLEAR, I noticed my blackheads on my nose were gone! My magnify mirror don't lie. No perfume, no dye, no crazy stuff but very clean. The exfoliate beads was very subtle because it doesn't scratch at all like st ives apricot scrub. Its more like gently exfoliating. I only use twice or 3 times a week because its only for dirty face from busy day or wore makeup all day. I have sensitive and oily skin, so I found this perfect cleanser. After clean, make sure you put toner, serum and moisture or face spray. Definitely, will repurchase again!"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Singapore,One of the best Exfoliating 😍,Been searching for exfoliating products.

CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Australia,Great! ,"Very good with helping get rid of dead skin cells & all the nasties on your skin from a long day outside (or inside.)

CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,USA,Clinique All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution - 150ml,"I absolutely love this cleanser, I don't use it every day; only when I wash my hair or on evenings I feel like I really need a deep clean. (About 3x a week). The exfoliation is perfect because I feel like some cleansers say they exfoliate and you can't feel anything granular or scrubbing effect at all. You definitely feel this one! It brings out my impurities and helps me get rid of pimples from sweat. I highly recommend this if you don't have too sensitive of skin."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Canada,Your Skin Will Seriously Thank YOU!,"Your skin will seriously thank you for this product. I struggled the last 7 months of my pregnancy with extremely gross acne and severe oily skin, and ever since buying this product (2 weeks ago), my skin looks more AMAZING each and everyday!! My skin also doesn't look as crusty/flaky when I wear makeup anymore either. I'm honestly obsessed!"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Australia,it’s ok,"This is average for me, there are other cleansers and exfoliators I like a lot better. Didn’t make me break out though which is a plus, but didn’t feel like my face was really exfoliated so more like just a cleanser"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Australia,ok,I love this cleanser. It exfoliates my skin while leaving zero residue behind.  have to use a cream moisturizer after that but if you have oily skin no need to use a moisturizer.
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,USA,I love this face cleanser,"I was looking for a new face cleanser and I am so happy I found this product. My face feels so clean and smooth, but not overly dry. I will definitely make this a part of my daily routine."

CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Canada,Clinique All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution - 150ml,"I prefer this to its predecessor, Pep start. It is gentler than the other and creamier as well (as opposed to the jelly aspect being more prominent). I believe if you liked its discontinued counterpart, you will like this one. It’s mainly preference that would decide if you like this over the other one."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Canada,Was skeptical at first,"I was really disappointed when the CityBlock charcoal wash was discontinued but don't have any complaints about this as its replacement.  The added bonus is that it doesn't have the ""ashy"" scent present.  It seems to be doing a decent job of preventing ""Covid acne"" caused by wearing a face mask."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,USA,Pep Start’s Replacement,"This has all the same ingredients as its predecessor (less the artificial colors.) It doesn’t feel quite as scrubby, but it’s a close enough dupe that I’m satisfied."

The brand never disappoints me so I’m exited to use this product. However, I did purchase a smaller bottle to try it out and see if it’s good which it should be as I’ve heard many good things about this product. "
CLINIQUE-All About Clean 2-in-1 Cleansing + Exfoliating Jelly Anti-Pollution,Australia,Great price and feels great,"Love this product. My skin is so smooth and fresh after using it.

OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,New Zealand,love,I love this cleanser have gotten 3 bottles of it already. I use it as my second cleanser and it breaks down all the remaining makeup i didnt get esp around the hairline I usually don’t like the citrus scents but I really love this one it’s not super subtle. I love the freshness it gives my face 🥰🥰
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,decent,"Have repurchased it three times for hubs. He has normal, prone to break out skin and it sufficiently cleans his skin without drying. For my dry skin it is a little drying and I only use it when my skin needs a deeper cleanse."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,love it ,"this product was amazing for my skin, haven’t brought another one yet but plan on it eventually however did leave my skin a little tight but also really soft feeling

OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,New Zealand,best thing ever ,I love this! Got it in a tester bottle and fell in love and purchased the real thing. This has made my skin so nice and glowy and cleared up my acne while being super gentle on skin. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Malaysia,Meh,"I love love love other Ole Henriksen products like it’s Dark Spot Toner and the purple moisturiser with peptide in it. However, this one just doesn’t cut it for me. My face doesn’t feel…clean. It claims to remove makeup residue but I don’t think it does a really good job for me. Smells nice though. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,Mrs,"I love this cleanser! It easily removes my make up but leaves my skin feeling plump and moist. It smells heavenly and a little bit goes a long way so it’s also economical to purchase.
Great brand and great product."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,New Favourite. ,"I first received a free sample of this but loved it so much I immediately got the full size product. It smells divine. So relaxing and easy to use. I’ve had zero irritation or negative outcomes and I use it every time I shower. Great at taking off make up, great for oil control. Feels fantastic too. Can’t recommend enough. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Canada,All time favorite skincare product!,This is my all time favorite skincare product! ive been using it for about a year now and im in love. It has an amazing fresh fruity scent and always leaves my skin feeling clean and glow-y. it is a little pricey (at least for me) but its definitely worth it.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Malaysia,Truly Amazing! ,"Just bought it, and 1st time trying it. The orange smell are balance and not overpowering, the texture are good non sticky/greasy- very refreshing after wash. I felt my skin soft after using it. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,Ole Henriksen Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser - 60ml,I love the way this smells - it's a not-too-overwhelming citrus scent. And a little goes a long way with this product!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,Incredible,"The only cleanser I’ve used that has actually transformed skin. Something about it works magic for me. I very rarely have breakouts, whereas before they were a regular occurrence. My skin feels smooth and refreshed when I use it.
use it"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,cleanser,Very very very very very very very very nice cleanser. Left your skin smooth hydrated and shiny. Very gentle on skin. Good purchase. Highly recommended if you have dark spots on skin.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Malaysia,Love love loveeeee,"Good cleanser tho. It does remove my makeup thoroughly and does not strip away my skin. It is very gentle and effective! Sometimes I felt like it doesn't do anything much other than removing my makeup, but I felt clean. So yeahhh."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,okay,"Smell good. I love the texture of the cleanser. So gentle and smooth. Maybe will purchase again. I always love Ole Henriksen’s products, affordable and easy to use"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,New Zealand,Love this,"I originally bought the 60ml size so I could test it. It actually lasted me such a long time but I decided to get the bigger size this time cause its more cost effective. It smells amazing! kind of like vitamin c tablets 🤣. It works well, it removes make up no problem and keeps my skin feeling fresh and clear. Highly recommend this product. My sisters now use it and swear by it also. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,best cleanser ,I went on a holiday and forgot to take this with me and my skin hated me because of it I broke out so much until I came back home and used it again it keeps my skin so clear and pimple free 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,"Great for dry skin, or for Step 2 double-cleansing","I have dry skin, and I wear makeup 2-3 days per week. I alternate between using this (to provide additional cleaning on the days that I wear makeup, or to serve as Step Two on when I double-cleanse) and using Clinique cleaning balm (to provide a basic wash, on the days when I'm foundation-free and I'm only single-cleansing). I totally recommend this product -- it cleanses skin without stripping and it has a great orange scent. The only reason that I alternate is because I try not to use cleansers (as a general rule) on days when a balm will suffice."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,Not for dry skin,I love this brand but this cleanser is not meant for dry skin. It makes my skin feel tight and dehydrated after using it. And the orange scent is overpowering. Pass.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Singapore,Nice smell,"Nice smelling product, but a little watery, will have to be careful not to squeeze out too much. I have quite oily skin, and will have to wash twice to make face cleaner. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,go-to face cleanser ,"This is my go-to face cleanser, it leaves my skin feeling so clean and bright. I tend to have very oily skin and this cleaner effectively rids my face of all the day’s oil build up. Also brightens my skill which is usually quite dull due to my odd working hours "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,Love love love!,"I have oily skin and I thought this cleanser wouldn’t work for me but it’s soooo good! Everything about it, the smell, the texture, the application. I 100% would recommend this!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Canada,Hands down to the best cleanser,This is my go to cleanser. It gives me a smooth and clean skin without ripping off the hydration. It has very nice scent.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Singapore,Love yet Hate it at the same time,"This is my love and hate review for this cleanser. I feel like the cleanser is good for my skin. It feels refreshing everytime i use it but at times, it stings my skin (rarely but it stings). And this cleanser definitely stings my eyes too. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,Ole Henriksen Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser - 60ml,"Love, love, love this cleanser. It has a kind of creamy texture that I initially found a little tricky to lather - what works best for me is to massage it directly onto my face, rather than try to work up a lather in my hands first - but it always leaves my skin feeling super soft, clean, and well-nourished. I also really love the scent, which is fresh and invigorating and citrus-forward, especially in the mornings, though I recognize it might not be for everyone. This is now my go-to everyday cleanser. I'm so glad I tried it."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,fresh clean and aroma is lux,This is the perfect end of day cleanser - part of my bed time face clean routine. Gently foaming deep clean that leaves my skin firm. I love this product and the smell it just fresh and beautiful 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Canada,Happy discovery,My face feels so soft and clean without drying it out. Great for dry and semi-sensitive skin

OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,I love it!,"I love everything about this product!! It smells amazing, cleans make-up easy - without any irritation to eyes and leaves skin incredibly smooth and fresh! I highly recommend it!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,New Zealand,Fresh and Sensitive ,"This has been my favorite face cleanser. It's gentle and hydrating. My skin is very sensitive and prone to reactions, however this particular product has been a lifesaver for the past three years and counting. I follow through with the truth serum, eye creme and gel creme moisturizer. The Vit C has been keeping my face plump and fresh, applying full face makeup has reduced for me since I started Ole Henriksen Vit C products. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,Not good unless you’re after a breakout,"Do not waste your time or money, this is terrible for your skin I do not recommend. Made me break out after using it for a week. So many better options out there for a general cleanser"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Malaysia,orange smell,smells good. it's very refreshing smell in the morning. Nice orangy smell. does its job. Good face wash. mot too drying but gives the good clean feel afterwards.  
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,Ole Henriksen Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser - 60ml,"This has actually become my go-to cleanser! For reference I have combo skin and my core issues are hyperpigmentation and texture. 

I usually switch around depending on my skin, makeup and the season between Paula’s Choice, this, and Grown Alchemist. I love all them but this one leaves my face glowing, buffs away the dead skin, and gives me more defined/less textured skin. 

Also you only need a small small amount of product, like the 60mL has lasted me for months and I’m still not halfway through it."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Canada,Ole Henriksen Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser - 60ml,"My fav! Out of everything I’ve tried I go back to this. I love using it In the morning, it’s invigorating! Sweet orange smell, very creamy lather. This whole line of products is just lux and amazing!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,can become over powering. ,Not my usual as they didn’t have that in stock and wasn’t sure when it was coming in I was recommended this as an alternative - I have used other products in the past from here but they have been a bit hit and miss. This one was ok at first but then I started to find it annoyed my skin and made it go red and seem to have an orange tint to my skin so I stopped using it. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,MUA,I love the way this cleanser makes my face feel after I use it. Clean and fresh without that dry feeling. It smells divine and a little goes a long way. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,Gentle and works,one of the best cleaners for my skin. I'm normal/dry and it's gentle yet effective. It's also not too drying
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,refreshing morning cleanser,"This is a great morning cleanser, the scent is super refreshing and it’s not drying/stripping. Leaves the skin bright and plump. I probably wouldn’t use it as a night time cleanser, I found it didn’t do a great job of removing makeup/sunscreen. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,Nice Cleanser,Nice gentle cleanser which smells lovely and citrusy. Does leave my skin feeling clean and lovely. I do find it’s a little too gentle to clean some of my eye makeup off though. Otherwise it’s a nice product and I have bought it a few times. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,great,This cleanser is really refreshing and brightening. It didn’t dry out my skin like others have in the past. I have combination skin and it didn’t do much for my oily t-zone. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,Relaxing,"I had this in a trial size then decided to buy the bigger one, it lathers really well and wakes my face up in the morning, and gently removes dirt easily at night. Smells good, and I think it brightens my face too"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,New Zealand,Always a joy,I loved the Ole Henriksen Serum and thought I'd complete the whole pack so it will take effect better. First and second day using this felt already amazing!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Malaysia,so good!,i really love the smell.. this cleanser work well with my skin. i used one set and everything is good i swear. u guys should give it a try okey! better buy full size because small one is not enough🥺
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,New Zealand,Good product,"I like the smell, it's fruity and fresh. It feel nice to apply, it's smooth and bubbles up nicely. My face feels clean and fresh after use. I recommend this product as a good staple in the routine. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Malaysia,not bad ,"It’s a gentle cleanser, good for everyday use. It’s smells good too, citrusy. Nothing too special but I would purchase again. The price point isn’t too bad for a good cleanser "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,Unsure,Unsure how i feel about this product. It is smooth and feels good but I’ve been using for a little while and unsure if its actually making a difference to my skin. If you like orange scent its for you as the scent is really strong. Shocked me at first. Will keep using til its finished and hopefully see more obvious results! :)
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Singapore,Refreshing!,I enjoy this cleanser for its wonderful citrusy smell.  Refreshing pick me up in the mornings. The price is reasonable and it complements the vitamin c serum in my skin care routine.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,New Zealand,one of my favourite ,Loved this product.  Making my face so fresh. And smells good as well. I had even tone which is getting better now . I hope this one helping me a lot. I am using the third one now. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,Love it,"Great product, brightens my skin while clearing the skin. Leaving a moist skin texture. Highly recommend. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,best cleanser,"This product has to be without a doubt the best cleanser I have ever discovered! Removes all make up, smells delightful and the most softest application on your skin (not harsh like most cleansers). Leaves skins feeling fresh and invigorated. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Malaysia,Strong fragrance,The cleanser works well and doesn’t break me out. But I took one star off because of the strong orange scent. It smells pleasant but the fragrance cant be good for your skin
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Malaysia,100ml of ole,"Smells- good
Creamy need water to foam
Not good with oil makeup remover. No foam. Need double facial for oily face too."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,best cleanser ,really effective cleanser. It removes makeup so very effectively  it also had a light exfoliating effect without  leaving skin irritated. it has a nice light smell 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Canada,Ole Henriksen Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser - 150ml,"Not for me, gave me severe breakouts. I used caudalie’s face wash before this one and that is absolutely amazing. Not sure, if it’s causing other people breakouts but I have normal skin, not very sensitive. I started getting breakouts after using it, new pimples everyday. and when I stopped using it my pimples started getting better. I don’t have acne prone skin and don’t remember the last time I naturally got pimples."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,Cleanser,I was actually looking for the foaming facial wash. But couldn’t find so i ended up buying this one so far it was okay. Did not have a break out while using this product so its good.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,Clean,I love how well it works. Has a very fresh smell and takes off all the make up. My face feels so when I am done.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,New Zealand,Nice cleanser,This is a gentle cleanser with a nice orange scent. I use this daily after I've remover my makeup. It cleans my skin well without making it feel dry or tight afterwards. I would repurchase this
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Canada,holy grail cleanser,"This is the best thing out there for keeping your face moisturized while cleansing. I suffer from eczema on the face and everything flares it up and dries me out. This does not, I absolutely love it!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Malaysia,good cleanser,Its great that I can use it daily. Does not strip off my skin. Does not feel tight or dry even though I use it daily on my combo skin. Smells good. Very orangey haha…love it. Definitely one of my fav cleanser now. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Malaysia,Expensive but worth it!,"A little goes a long way, I use this cleanser along with the moisturising cream and they are heavenly. The smell is nice and it is definitely helpful in cleansing without causing major breakouts for me."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,Love!,This cleaner is great!  Leaves your skin feeling clean and doesn't dry it out.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,New Zealand,Fresh scent and gentle,"I feel like the smell on this would probably be divisive, I love it but can see how others wouldn't.
The cleanser itself is great, I didn't have many, if any, breakouts when using it when my skin usually plays up a lot."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,good stuff!,I really enjoy the smell of this product. It’s not too expensive either. I don’t like to spend too much money on cleansing since I only use it after a messy day at work.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,"fresh scent, non stripping",My husband loves this and I’ve repurchased many times now. Doesn’t bother or strip my sensitive skin and had a really refreshing scent for the morning wash 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,Cleanser,"I love the Ole range and I'm slowly replacing my entire skincare routine with Ole products. with the whole suite of products my skin is definitely looking great: hydrated and glowly, soft to touch and a more even surface. The only thing is I'm not sure if the cleanser is worth the pricetag when I've used great cleansers at a lower price. If you can indulge, absolutely do it! But if your budgeting, save the money and put it towards another Ole product like the Orange Barrier booster for better bang for your buck."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,New Zealand,glowing skin.,Love this cleanser! Skin feels nice and smooth and more refined with use. Great thing is it does not strip skin of moisture and does not dry out skin 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Canada,Ole Henriksen Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser - 150ml,"I tried this daily cleanser from Olehenriksen for the first time ever recently, the mini size has lasted me 2 months to my surprise and I use it once a day. What I like about it is the scent, its invigorating. It’s non stripping and washes away excess dirt, makeup, and surface oils on the skin. I bought it because I needed a face wash with an awakening scent and this was good for that. I recommend."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,Can cause breakouts ,Both my partner and I get breakouts from these products. Maybe not suited for sensitive skin. I do love the brand though. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,love!,"This is probably my 6th purchase of this product I use it in the shower to take my make up of works well has a light orange smell to it, takes makeup off with ease "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,NOPE,This did absolutely nothing for me. First it didn’t lather up very well and when washing this off it left a film on my skin and I didn’t feel clean at all. Plus the smell is very strong! I didn’t mind it but if you are sensitive to fragrance this is not for you. I got halfway through this and had to use a different cleanser and that’s when I realized how bad this was doing for my skin!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,beautiful cleanser ,This brand is my absolute favourite when it comes to skincare! i cannot underestimate the effectiveness and ease this brand is to use and the results are amazing! 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,Ole Henriksen Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser - 60ml,This is a great gentle cleanser. It’s brightening and does the job. I have dry sensitive skin for reference.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Canada,Long Lasting Cleanser,This cleanser lasts a long time for me despite this being the “mini” version. I use this cleanser everyday. It feels refreshing and thoroughly cleans my face by getting rid of dirt and excess oil.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Singapore,Try,Bought this product during Sephora Beauty Pass Sales period to try it out as I saw plenty of reviews exclaiming how awesome this product is. Pretty packaging too.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Canada,Gentle and Effective,"Best cleanser I’ve ever use. I love the citrus scent, the lather, and that it doesn’t strip my skin."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,Ole Henriksen Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser - 60ml,"I love this cleanser! It smells great, a little goes a long way, and it seriously lasts me forever and I always use a generous amount. Really makes my skin look and feel clean and helps clear my break outs when I use it consistently."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,Horrible product,The worst. It does not do what it says it will do. A waste of money and time spent.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,Fresh skin,I'm a big fan with this cleanser as a little goes a long way and it's great when using my Foreo. The only thing is it does not remove foundation very well if you have removed prior to cleansing your face.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Singapore,Good Ole,"This cleanser is not that bad. I did’t felt much difference but then it feels kinda fresh after using. One time use, not prefer to buy again.
Smells great. Give it a try………………."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,Ole Henriksen Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser - 150ml,"Love the light citrus scent and clean, moistorizing feel of this cleanser."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,Ole Henriksen Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser - 150ml,I would say this product smells good and it did leave my skin feeling smooth. I don’t wear makeup at all so I’m not sure how good it is at removing makeup but trust me when I say that my skin feels rejuvenated. And it doesn’t leave your skin dry afterwards.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,feel so clean and refreshed,"I work as a flight attendant. And after a long day of work, my face gets so greasy. I call it bus face. Sometimes I just want to feel refreshed after a long day and this product does that for me. It makes me feel awake, fresh and clean after. And like I washed all the grease off and have fresh clean skin. Love this product."

OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,New Zealand,Smells amazing ,This cleanser smells amazing! I love orange scent. I don't have overly sensitive skin to fragrance in cleaners so if you do have sensitive skin I probably wouldn't recommend. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Singapore,love,"This cleanser is my new favourite. I have an oily skin type and my skin has really cleared up since using it in conjunction with a salicylic acid. 
It smells absolutely amazing too!"

It’s brighten your face and give you healthy soft fresh skin look I just stick with this cleanser now"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Australia,Ms,"I really love this - it’s very thick and you only need a tiny bit to cleanse your whole face. It has a nice, not too strong, fragrance and I look forward to using it ! Does the job well of removing oil from my skin. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,New Zealand,strong scent,quite an average cleanser but not the biggest fan of the really strong orange smell
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,Worth the Hype!,"I’m not one to usually spend much on my cleansers, so I was skeptical of this one. I use my holy grail Cerave foaming wash cleanser at night, because it does remove makeup better. However, I use this one in the morning and absolutely love it! It leaves my skin feeling super soft and moisturized! It smells amazing, however if you’re sensitive to fragrance, this might not be for you. Overall, I give this cleanser a 10/10!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,Ole Henriksen Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser - 150ml,Love the refreshing feeling my skin gets after washing my face with this. Will repurchase…
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Canada,go to cleanser,"One of my favourite product. It leaves a great essence after washing face. My skin feels so soft and clear. Definitely gonna buy it again. 

However, the price should be a little less not that expensive."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,USA,Pass. Not worth the hype,"Not worth your money. This product does not clean well especially if you have a foundation on or any type of makeup and does not dissolve easily, it’s like rubbing your face with a gooey substance. Not enjoyable. Also when you rinse your face guaranteed to have orange goo in your sink afterwards. Not worth it. Not worth the hype either.
The only positive is that you smell oranges! So the smell is pleasant."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,Malaysia,So-So,"Your ordinary cleanser that clean your oily face at the end of the day. Nothing major to point out about its effectiveness in brightening. I did break out from my initial use of this but it gets better as days went by. However, nothing wonderful about it so not going to repurchase! "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,New Zealand,Great Cleanser,I really like this cleanser. Vitamin C is good for tightening lightening and brightening.  Leaves my face looking fresh and glowy. 60mls is definitely a good size to start. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Truth Juice™ Daily Cleanser,New Zealand,Amazing ,I just randomly bought this face and I’m amazed with this juicy face wash. It had juicy orange fragrance which wakes up your skin. My skin looks bright right after one wash. It makes your skin tighter fresh.

LANEIGE-Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cleansing Foam,Singapore,It’s alrightt ,"The smell is personally a little too chemical-ly. Not rly for me, and it’s kind of stripping for my skin. Would I get it a second time? Maybe not. Do I recommend it? Also maybe not "
LANEIGE-Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Cleansing Foam,Singapore,water bank blue hyaluronic cleansing foam,"Ordered this as one of my hurried attempts to tackle the sudden eczema around the lips area. Turns out to be a very nice cleansing foam. Soft strong foam which cleans effectively, does not bother my sensitive eyes, and yet is gentle enough for the dry and irritated lip areas… "

FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Malaysia,Nice,This feels good on my skin. It removes my makeup and oils. I use this every morning after I woke up. It has been in my routine everyday. It’s pricey but worth the try. 
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Singapore,chong ,"Texture: The overall texture is a little sticky, not like protein water
 Sticky, really sticky kind of sticky.

Taste: I like it

Use: Use day and night, pat three times.  Sometimes she is also used as a water film wet compress.

The effect of wet compress is very good, there is a clear feeling that the skin is full of water, and it is soft and tender.  There are many antioxidants, and the overall condition of the skin is not bad now.  The overall anti-inflammatory effect can be used during this periodQ, the acne is a little better than before, only a few will appear.

"
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Singapore,good!,"Like many other fresh products, it is a delight to use! Almost zero scent. Which is what I was looking for. Good for a morning cleanse. Not too strong. A gentle cleanser to protect your skin barrier"
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Australia,Treatment,Hmm I cant say I noticed a visible difference in my skin while using. It was pleasant and did not have a strong fragrance nothing that stood out to make me what to repurchase.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Singapore,easy to apply ,Love this for first time use. Skin felt great and did not react badly. No flare up or sensitivity issue for me. However it is too expensive and wish there is refill bottle for sustainability purpose. Would love to repurchase but unfortunately the price is too high. 
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Singapore,repurchase,Amazing good i love it. Skin feels clean and smooth after using it. I like to use it as the first step of my skincare! Will repurchase after im done with this again
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,Pass.,I really like Fresh but this was a total miss for me. Feels just like water. I don’t think it actually cleanses and in fact seemed to be rather drying on my skin.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Malaysia,so so,"Got the travel size to try out the product cause it claims that it doesn't feel sticky even without using water afterwards. However, it still feels tacky to me though it did cleanse my makeup off."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Singapore,Not as good as I thought,Expecting some cleansing effect but seems not.. A bit disappointed because it’s kind of its selling point from advertisement. Luckily I bought a small size for trial (but it’s still not cheap actually). Suggest to try for small size for first time.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Australia,Such a good cleanser,Bought the mini of this to try and it was really nice! Left my skin feeling clean and glowing with no irritation. Would definitely recommend for everyday use.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Singapore,gift,My bestie loves fresh and I got her this as a mini gift. Well not too bad. She has a busy schedule to care for 20 kids and thought this will take some time off her. 
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Malaysia,nice,"Love the smell and the texture of the cleansing water. 
Very recommended ! 
For those with sensitive skin can try this product. The best thing about it is that you dont have to rinse it. "
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,No thanks,"Was excited for this, but it really irritated my skin after a couple uses.  This doesn’t take off eye makeup easily either.  I have to use a lot of the product on several cotton pads to remove makeup and get a ‘clean’ feeling.  Made my skin burn.  Not worth the money in my opinion.  Disappointed :("
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Singapore,Treatment cleanser ,Not oily. Water base. Helps to clean out.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,"Nice, but the wrong price!","I like this product. It is cleansing and hydrating and works well! But I didn't notice any drastic changes or improvements from the ""treatment"" side of this. I'm a big fan of the Son & Park Beauty Water and that one works just as well (if not better) with much more bang for your buck. The price just makes this very underwhelming so, while I like using it and will finish the bottle, I won't repurchase it."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Australia,worth every dollar! ,"I loveee this product! It breaks down all the makeup on your skin and leaves it feeling clean and fresh and hydrated I use this after my face wash with the soy face cleanser. Use a cotton pad and wipe till it wipes clear, leave it on no need to rinse you don’t feel it once it’s dried, start doing my makeup. It just feels like your skin’s taken a massive gulp of water and it feels incredible!

Honestly this + the Umbrian clay toner (not to use under makeup) has prevented a lot of breakouts because my pores aren’t clogged, ever! Specially after a whole day with makeup! I love this product, breaks down my sunscreen, my serums from the morning routine and night routine, any dirt and pollution before makeup and during the day. It’s definitely a product I’ll be buying countless times forever!!! I hope they never stop making it. I’m really impressed with this product! Worth every cent"
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Australia,love love love it!!!!,"I loveee this product! It breaks down all the makeup on your skin and leaves it feeling clean and fresh and hydrated unlike a micellar water remover which just leaves your skin dry and stripped off its oils. I use this after my face wash with the soy face cleanser which is another amazing product…and use a cotton pad to pick up any pollution, leave it on, put on my nicamide serum to control my oil and start doing my makeup. Honestly this + the Umbrian clay toner (not to use under makeup) has prevented a lot of breakouts because my pores aren’t clogged, ever! Specially after a whole day with makeup! I love this product, breaks down my sunscreen, my serums from the morning routine, any dirt and pollution before makeup and during the day. It’s definitely a product I’ll be buying countless times forever!!! "
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Singapore,cleansing treatment ,Been using those for close to 3 weeks. I can see that my face texture improved. I usually use this in the morning as I’m lazy to wash face in the morning. And at night just to prep my face for my night routine. Using it together with their Kombucha treatment essences. Perfect combo. 
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,not worth it,"I finished the bottle (I use cleansing waters mostly first thing in the morning so as to not dry out my skin from washing) and if I’d noticed any benefit besides simply removing makeup or AM oil I’d buy again, but nope. Not worth the price."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Singapore,morning routine,Good morning routine as a cleanser. For those who want to preserve their skin barrier. Good for those who use acids and actives in their skincare and want to preserve their skin barrier. Lightweight. Doesn’t leave a heavy finish. 
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Singapore,I thought I don’t need it,"One of Fresh staff introduced me to this. Initially I was a bit…meh but after I gave it a try!!! This is amazing! It really helps me to make sure that my skin is clean, sometimes I just didn’t clean my neck thoroughly. It really helps to hydrates my skin & after using it, my skin immediately has a healthy glow and I look more “awake” too! I can really tell the before & after difference"
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Australia,Leaves some makeup behind…,I love using this product because it doesn’t dry out my skin like regular micellar water does however I will say I do have makeup still left over (particularly mascara) after using this which is a bit annoying and hence the 4 stars but overall I will repurchase again!
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Singapore,Fantastic,"This product cleanses any remaining residue on face after washing and it smells light, gentle and refreshing. I have purchased this multiple times and it has earned a permanent spot in my skincare regime.
"
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Singapore,Great cleansing treatment.," I could really tell it was cleaning it. It almost feels like a toner on my skin and I love that the ingredients are clean. Leaves your skin feeling great!

FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Singapore,Worked very well!,My absorbs very good and does not leave a residue or tackiness on the skin and my face feels and looks very supple. It doesn’t strip or dry out my skin. It fits perfectly in a routine. Great product!!!
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,I really love this product! I was sent the product complimentary by Influenster but will definitely be repurchasing and have already recommended to my friends!

FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Not a bad product but not my first choice. I’m not big On no rinse treatments. So although it did the job I prefer to get a good wash in and this is good in a pinch.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,Great innovative product,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really enjoyed using this product. It has quickly become a favourite for me in my skin care routine. With this product you do not have to worry about trying to wash your face by splashing it like in the commercials and then getting yourself soaked. I like using it with a cotton pad because you can see if anything is left and feel confident that your skin is clean. This is quick and easy to use for on the go or when you’re tired before bed. I love the way my skin looks and feels after using this product my skin is glowy, smooth, and my pores look refined. It is gentle with a very subtle scent and did not irritate my skin.  My skin is sensitive and can be dry. After using this product my skin felt clean but not stripped. I would definitely recommend trying this out."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,Amazing product.,I received this product free for testing purposes but I loved it. I did have some acne but I was not sure if it was from the cleanser or something else. I highly recommend trying this product has an amazing smell.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I like this product because of its 2 in 1 treatment. The tingling sensation feels like the product is actually working. I also noticed my pores look more refined. It’s definitely a staple product.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,A must have on my skincare counter,"This has to be my favorite liquid cleanser so far. I’m already half way through the bottle. It really came in handy when I couldn’t wash my face due to my brows being microbladed. I was able to apply this cleansing treatment to cotton pads and it truly cleaned my skin. I also use it to remove my makeup before doing a second cleanse.  I took off one star because it could be better with eye makeup removal. 

The product was gifted by Sephora so I could test it out for a month and provide my honest review.  I’ll definitely be repurchasing. I love the Fresh Kombucha essence too."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I absolutely loved this product. I received this product complimentary from influenster but I will definitely be repurchasing. It takes off all my makeup with no hassle and the best part is that I don’t have to wash it off. It makes removing makeup so easy and it’s safe for my sensitive skin. I usually have to use a makeup remover then a cleanser after but this product was an all in one!
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,Love this !! Nice light fresh sent and feels cooling to the skin. I use it in the am instead of washing and I can see a little dirt on the cotton pad after use . It does not feel dry on my skin or tight and I tend to be a dryer skin type by too.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,Sticky?,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I recieved thiss product for free from influenster, and although I like the product initially, I found it made my face feel almost sticky after using it which I did not like and it made me want to rinse after use."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,Great Cleanser,"I received this product to test through Influenster. 

Overall, I was pleased with it and would mix it in with beauty products. I did feel like it felt like a soapy layer in skin."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,Great product,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Tried this product through Influenster and I loved it. My skin felt super fresh and clean after use and love the ant pollution aspect to it. Awesome. Could be a bit more interesting of a smell but all in all a great product. Also removes makeup.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,"simple clean, good addition to morning routine","I ended up trying this after going to the Sephora online seminar with the creator of the brand and this product being recommended. I do agree that it creates a clean feeling without stripping all the essential oils from your skin and not feeling “too dry” after usage. A good part of a morning routine if you do your deep wash at night,"
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,The best.,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have been having breakouts often lately. They are mainly around my chin. No products have ever cleared them up, even prescriptions, until this one! It has become the number one staple item for me. My skin has never looked better. I am super low maintenance, so products need to be easy to use. The no rinse formula makes it easy to travel and use, and even when I’m feeling super lazy, I feel like it’s easy to do! So I never skip a day or night. Seriously... I’m in love."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love double cleansing and this one is a big part in it. I typically use a cheaper drug store micelles water but I love this and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,Just DO IT,"I have extremely sensitive, combo skin and I swear damn near ANYTHING can break me out. I examine ingredient lists like a forensic investigator looking for that missing piece of the puzzle.
I have never used a ""no-rinse"" cleanser before, and at first was really put off by that notion and rinsed it off anyway. Then I considered that it was formulated for this and to just give that a try and YES. I will never go back. I will never use anything else.
It's not drying, it's not too heavy, it's not sticky, it doesn't feel like there's residue... it's just GOOD. And it doesn't break me out and has improved my skin. 
TIP: after using, wait a minute or two to let it sink in before applying anything. Makes ALL the difference guys, trust me!
100000/10 recommend."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,if my soulmate were a cleanser,"Tried so many that disappointed till this one, I wanted a simple wipe on cleanser, I don’t wear makeup, just wanted something to freshen my face and this hit all the marks. Feels clean after, not right or red (I have rosacea)."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,pretty good,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I got this as a free sample from Influenster. Overall I really like the texture of the product, it’s lightweight with no strong fragrance. It kind of reminds me of bioderma micellar water. It does a pretty good job taking off my makeup or just cleaning my face before I go in with my second cleanse. I didn’t layer on my skincare on top of it since I’m on retin-A right now so I’m not sure how they would interact with each other, but I didn’t get any irritation from it at all."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,I received this product complimentary through Influenster and it’s super amazing. It removes makeup extremely easy and is very light on your skin. It also had an added bonus and made my pores practically disappear. I definitely recommend this product!!
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I absolutely loved this product. I received it from Influenster and it quickly became one of my new favourites. When I’m having a not so big day for my skin it’s a nice option to have so I don’t have to deep cleanse when my skin isn’t very dirty.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,"I love the way this feels on my face. My skin feels clean, fresh and bright after using this."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,"I love the way this feels on my face. My skin feels clean, fresh and bright after using this."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,Loving this as a final cleansing step!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. In all honesty, I really enjoyed this product! Although it can be used as a normal cleanser, I loved using it after my cleansing routine. I often get out of the shower and still have eye makeup all over my face (it's impossible to get off). I use a cotton pad and swipe it all over my face to ensure that all my makeup is off. It doesn't leave a sticky/overdrying feeling after application, and you don't need to do any rinsing! Overall, I do think it improved the luminosity of my complexion and reduced the appearance of my pores."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I absolutely love how simple and easy to use this product is. My skin was glowing after using this for the first week! Definitely a new fav
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,"This is very nice. I can’t believe how much dirt is on the cotton pad when I use this in the AM. I have not and do not intend to use this as a stand alone makeup remover. I think I would use half the bottle in one use if I used it for that purpose. I like that it doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky or tight. I don’t need to apply a moisturizer after, which is pretty amazing. I still do haha but the point is that I don’t neeeed to. A lot of times these kinds of products make my skin so thirsty but not this one. I knocked off a star bc I think you have to use a considerable amount of product for each use. It may or may not bless me with teeny tiny little break outs, but I’m not totally sure if it’s from this product. Even if it is, I don’t hold break outs against products bc my skin is a hormonal mess, just thought someone with acne prone skin might want to know this potential issue."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,nice second cleanse,"I enjoyed this product a lot but I don’t think I would ever use it as a sole cleanser. It’s definitely nice as a second cleanse, however it also defeats the purpose of a toner and I quite enjoy my toners. I tend to use this before cleansing to ensure all of my makeup is removed."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,Definitely worth it!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I was lucky to get chosen by Influenster to receive this product complimentary to try out and share my feedback.  After using it for almost 3 weeks, I can confidently recommend this product for anyone who is looking for an easy to use, effective, no mess cleanser to take off your makeup and leave your skin feeling clean and soft!  I have tried this baby as part of my nighttime routine as well as morning routine to “wash” my face.  Initially, I was afraid that my face would break out because of the whole “no rinse”.  But I’m more than happy to share that my face did not break out and I found this product to be so gentle yet so effective to do the job at hand.   Must try!"
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,The perfect cleanse for those in a hurry,"I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review.  I selected this product because I am a new mom and simple, fast, effective skincare is my jam.  I also love that it is a clean beauty product.  This cleansing treatment worked great to remove all of the gross buildup on the skin throughout the day and was the perfect quick morning cleanse to refresh my skin and begin the day.  My skin felt clean, but not dry and it looked a lot more radiant after each use."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,Got this product to try out with the Influenster program. It was alright not the best. Great for sensitive skin and for cleaning your face and removing face makeup. But not so great for removing eye makeup
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,I really enjoy this product. I like that it is a one step cleanser and I don’t have to use multiple products. The smell is not overpowering and my skin feels soft after use. I highly recommend this product.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,Received from Influenster to try and I actually love this cleaning product. It left my face soft and not as dry as it was before.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,"I actually really enjoyed this product, which I did not think I would. It was very easy to use & wasn’t heavily fragranced. It did leave a thin layer on my skin after using it, not really sure how to describe it. It wasn’t uncomfortable, but it was weird to get used to. It did leave my face super moisturized though. 

I received this product as a complimentary sample through Influenster."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,Great!,This was a great product! Usually I find that makeup removers leave an oily residue but I didn’t find that with this one. And it actually got all of my makeup off in one swipe!
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,"I loved the ingredients, the scent, and the feeling this no rinse cleanser left on my skin. Never oily, never sticky! Stung around the eyes a bit so I tended to use a different cleanser for mascara, etc"
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,10/10 recommend,I love this product! You can literally feel it cleaning out your skin! Wish I would have gotten it sooner.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,love this product!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) LOVE this product, and live that there is kombucha in it. Makes your skin feel so smooth and so clean. I got this from the @influenster program and will be repurchasing!"
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,Fantastic Cleanser!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product is wonderful! I was provided with a free sample to try and will definitely be adding it to my beauty routine. Not only is it extremely easy to use, it left my skin feeling so fresh and soft! Definitely works as advertised."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,GLOW UP IS REAL,After one week of use day/night my skin is very clear and hydrated. This cleans without stripping and is great for the low-maintenance gal who doesn't always like waking up with a blast of water to the face. Best no rinse cleanser.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,Amazing product,"I got this fresh kombucha 2 in 1 cleanser sent to me to try and let me tell you it is perfect for when you don't want to scrub off your makeup after a night out! This cleanser takes off even the toughest of makeup. It took off my eyelash glue even, which I always am irritating my skin trying to scrub ot off but not with this product. It gently takes makeup off and cleanses your skin of any gunk or impurities that may be there at the same time. I highly recommend this product for anyone!!"
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Works great as makeup remover, face toner or just cleanser. Love that this works as all of those combined. All while leaving skin feeling nourished. Highly recommended! 

Received complimentary from Influenster. Would definitely purchase this again when I finish the bottle."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,"This product was pretty good, expect there are some improvements. It was a good option for removing makeup but it felt like my face definitely needed another traditional cleanser. It is a great alternative for some days but this product alone is not ideal for everyday use."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,A decent toner,"This does exactly what a toner should do: prep my face for the rest of my makeup routine. Not too drying, nor does it hurt my eyes if I get near them. I don’t think I’d pay full price, but it is a nice toner."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,dooooo it!,"I was pleasantly shocked at what this product did for my skin.  I have no idea what any of the claims or ingredients were, just using it because I got a free sample. It literally cleared up my pimples and made my skin smooth where-so I can’t even remember when my skin last looked that nice.  I immediately went to buy the full size bottle and refilled my sample for traveling. Highly recommend!"
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,love it,I never need a second cleanser it is such a beautiful product and leaves the skin glowy and clean
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,Lightweight refreshing cleanser,I loved the way my skin felt after using this cleanser. I have combination skin and my skin didn’t feel dry or like there was any residue left over. I face felt so clean and refreshed. The fragrance was so mild almost non existent which I also liked. I love using this as the first step in my skincare routine!
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,"Won't be repurchasing, unfortunately","I love the Kombucha Essence, so I thought I would give this a try to use in conjunction. This really doesn't do anything for me at all that I can see. It's not bad; it doesn't leave a sticky residue or make me break out or anything. I am just really unsure of what it is really doing for my skin in the long run. I will continue to use the one I bought but I will not be repurchasing it, unfortunately."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,I absolutely love this cleanser. It removes all of my makeup and does so without irritating my skin whatsoever. It even removed my packed on gold eyeshadow from New Years. 10/10!
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,I was pretty impressed with this product. Loved how it removed existing makeup residue. I have combination skin leaning more on the oily at times and somehow found that it left my skin feeling a bit dry.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I use it after cleansing, and it works to take everything off! I'm glad to have received it complimentary from Influenster."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,One of the best,The aroma is a little not so me. However one of the best all in one cleansers i have tried. Loved how it got my face feeling fresh after work. Amazing at getting makeup off.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,A great cleansing treatment! I was looking for a replacement for face wipes and this product works great with my reusable face pads. It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated without the glossy (greasy looking) feel.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,"Me encanto es de los mejores limpiadores que he utilizado, después de lavar mi cara con mi limpiador regular este limpiador hace remover cada partícula que me haya quedado, es gentil con mi piel y vi resultados positivos"
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,perfect for the morning face wash!,"This is the perfect face wash/no wash for mornings! I’m lazy and don’t like washing my face in the mornings, plus don’t always have time! So I love this cleansing treatment! I just drip it on a cotton round and wipe all around my face and voila! I have gone through it relatively quickly (about 3 months for one bottle) but it’s super worth it. Already purchased a second bottle!"
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,Great Multi-Purpose and Easy-to-Use Cleanser!,"*I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review* - I love how simple and easy this is to use! It left my skin feeling clean, but also hydrated and prepped for my following steps. However, I am not a fan of using this as my only cleansing step. I found my skin felt more clean when I used a cleansing balm before. In addition, not as much of my makeup was taken off with just this alone. I also really love this as a morning cleanse because it require no rinsing and is gentle."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,I love its aroma and that it leaves the skin super freshc
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,good stuff!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really love the smell of this product. It makes my skin feel so clean and removes makeup well. It can be a little drying though.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I wish I could give this 5 stars but I didn’t enjoy the smell of this product and it also emphasized the redness in my face. I got this product complimentary for testing purposes. I am sticking to bioderma for my makeup remover.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Love this stuff! I prefer to use it after cleansing to remove anything my cleanser didn’t get. It tingles so I can definitely feel it working!

FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,"#sephoragiftedme the new Kombucha Cleansing Treatment from Fresh as part of their #sephoraskinobsessions campaign!

This works so wonderfully as a morning cleanse and as a second cleanse at night. It's gentle, removes any dirt and makeup leftover after a first cleanse, and feels nice on the skin. Overall, I think it's a really good cleanser. It does leave my skin slightly tacky after use, but dries down fairly quickly. I don't know that I can attribute the difference in my skin clarity to this product alone, but I will say that the pores on my cheeks look better than they did before I started using this product."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,Not a fan,I received through Influenster and tried it daily for 2 weeks. I normally love Fresh products but this one is not for everyone. I have never seen my skin so broke out with acne after using a product. If you have sensative skin steer clear of this product. Also its not heavily scented which is great but it did leave my skin feeling sticky after and i found myself just using my normal cleanser after using this product.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,Light and refreshing,"Loved this as a cleanser and definitely felt that it made my skin feel clean. I wouldn't recommend it as a daily cleanser since I feel like I still need to use a light cleanser after this but this would be nice on something like a no make-up day to just wipe off the dirt and natural oils from the day. I do love that it's very light and refreshing on the skin after using though. 

This was gifted from @influenster but these reviews are my honest opinion"
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,Amazing!!!,"I received this product through Influenster to test in review complementary. And I will have to say this is by far my favorite product I have ever received from them to try. I love it as a make up remover it removes everything even waterproof mascara effortlessly. Whenever I’m not wearing make up and I just got out of the shower, I use it on a cotton ball on my face as a toner it has enhanced the look of my skin and made it more brighter then any other product I’ve ever used it is absolutely amazing!"
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,Demo By Fresh Educator!!!,"First was showed this by an educator from Fresh when he had me and another woman demo it...she and I was speechless. It takes so much impurities, it removes makeup as well but I love using it as an addition cleanser (I still love my jelly cleanser from Drunk Elephant). The smell of it is a little strange (perhaps it’s the kombucha one it) it dissipates after a few seconds. I highly suggest grabbing a cotton pad and testing this on your forehead at your local Sephora; so YOU, yourself can see how much it takes off."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,Good product!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product from influenster to review. I love how it smells and the cotton pad is dirty even after using a cream cleanser. Doesn't do anything for my pores but that might just be me. Bottle lasts a long time!
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,Great product,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product free from Influenster and I’m extremely satisfied with it! I use it whenever I’m in a hurry and unable to complete my normal skincare routine, or on days when I wear makeup. Super easy to use and so far it’s been very good for my skin!"
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,Pretty good but not amazing,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product is great for day when you’re not wearing any makeup and want to quickly cleanse your face. On days I do wear makeup, I found it 
wasteful with the amount of cotton pads I had to use to remove makeup, otherwise it does the job. 
I was sent this product to review and will definitely keep it in my cupboard for occasional use, however I don’t think it’ll be a staple especially for the price."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,Great for Moms,This product is great for on-the-go mom's! i don't recommend to take your makeup off but a great addition to a quick self care routine! None stripping but cleanses great! -received complimentary from Influenster
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,Canada,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product from @fresh and @influenster for free to test and review. I really enjoyed the freshness you feel from using the product. Removed make up well. Has no scent which is great I thought it might smell like kombucha so I’m glad it doesn’t. I would never pay the price they are asking for it. Did not notice  any changes in my skin as far as clarity or texture. #onestepwonder
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,Amazing,Really helped with my textured skin amazing product definitely worth it. My skin is smooth and looks flawless even without foundation.
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,New Must Have!!,"i really liked this product!! i was so impressed with the cleanser and how much it refined my pores. as someone with very large stubborn pores, i found that it definitely helped make them look smaller and less clogged. the product removed makeup gently while feeling refreshing! it didn't leave a film or anything."
FRESH-Kombucha Cleansing Treatment,USA,FRESH Kombucha Cleansing Treatment - 200ml,"I received this free from Influenster as a test product, and it just wasn't for me. I love the idea of it -- no rinse cleanser with toner. The actual use of it, though, left a lot to be desired. My skin felt like it had a film on it after using it, and it didn't feel clean. This one just wasn't for me."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Singapore,so gentle on the skin,"Love this brand. The products are so gentle on the skin. Skin feels soft and supple after washing without ""over-cleaning"". It foams nicely when the skin is wet enough. The scent is very refreshing. I use this as a make up remover as well."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Singapore,Ms,It's a lovely cleanser and super gentle to the skin
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Super effective!,I got this recommended to me at an in-store location and it's been so great for my skin! It makes my skin feel soft afterwards and removes extra makeup as well. It also smells so nice and feels so refreshing to the skin afterwards. Would recommend
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Singapore,Winner cleanser ,"I happened to get a small tube, just to give it a try. Unexpectedly, I totally fall in love. It is a greenish creamy texture & my skin doesn't feel tight at all. I've oily combination skin type. I always lookout for gel type cleanser but this cleanser had changed my concept. Abit pricy but it does what it should do. Worth a try! Definitely a must in my skincare routine. "
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,A daily must! Get your greens!,I received a full size in my boxycharm and I loved it so much I just ordered 2! I love the smell of it when I’m washing my face and my face feels so clean afterwards… it’s very affordable too considering how expensive good face wash is our ￼
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,A great addition to your skin care system!,"I was looking for a gentle cleanser that did not dry out my skin, but also gave just a hint of moisture at the same time.  Plus, I needed something that did not have a lot of fragrance to it.  I already use their moisturizing cream, so thought I would try this. So glad I did!  

This has not only helped with the cleansing, but gives just the right amount of moisture. I don’t get the migraines from it, it smells good and cleans really well!  Definitely worth trying and I am glad I added it to my routine."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Wouldn’t recommend for oily skin.,After using this product I immediately began to notice how oily my skin was becoming. I know I have a combination of both oily and dry but I’m especially oily around my nose and this made it worse wworse.worseJIovrralalsoeeeeeeeesensitive sking
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,skincare game changer!,"What an amazing game changer! My skin has been really oily the last few months, paired with terrible breakouts.

My skin doesn’t feel dry, I actually feel like it moisturizes my skin while cleaning at the same time."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,My new favourite!!,"This face wash is incredible. I recently switched from cetaphil after I suspected it was the culprit of my whiteheads after subbing out literally every other product I use. I had already tried the farmacy toner and had incredible results, so I decided to try this wash. It’s a thick paste that squirts out and easily lathers into a foam. It smells very light and fresh and leaves your skin feeling unbelievably soft and clean without feeling stripped or too tight. I feel like every ounce of the day is washed off my face effortlessly. I have sensitive acne prone combo skin and this face wash is soothing and hasn’t irritated or broken me out at all. It actually has helped contribute to my acne clearing up and stop reoccurring!! I love this face wash and this is now my staple, morning and night."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Did not live up to the hype,Super hard to get out of the tube. I feel like it takes a lot of product to get it to foam up. It feels nice and smells nice but didn’t do much for my skin
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Great for combo skin,"I’ve been using this cleaner for months and I love how easily it foams. It leaves the skin feeling clean, but not tight and dry. I also haven’t experienced any breakouts with this product!"
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Give it a try if you have sensitive/dry skin!,"Such a great face wash. I have a sensitive/dry skin combo and I just love the feel and freshness of this cleanser. Smells great, doesn't overwhelm the face nor strip away too much of the face's natural oils (just enough to get the job done). A bit pricey for me, but I think it's worth the investment and has become a part of my routine."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,My go to product,"I bought this cleanser at least more than 4th time ! Tried a bunch of cleanser and I always ending up buying this one ! Why ? Because of its creamy texture, it’s non stripping and really clean my skin after using the compliment Green Clean makeup remover cleanser balm ! Perfect combo to clean my combination skin, removing my makeup and sunscreen! I am still looking for the cleanser to help even out my skin but for now I’ll stick with this :)"

FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,A must have for daily routine,I’m 37 and have used this product for two years. I have combination skin and use it with my Foreo. It does an excellent job of cleansing and opening up my skin for following treatments and moisturizes as well. My other products are more effective because of this. Love it and definitely recommend. Also a little goes a long way with a Foreo so one pack usually lasts 2+ months which is great value.
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,I tried this through boxycharm a year ago and since then I’ve been using it since. It’s gentle and feels soothing.

FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Fantastic job again Farmacy,"I am so pleasantly surprised at how much I love this cleanser! I thought it might too harsh and too drying but I was wrong about that part. It’s perfect for my congested skin during the summer in the south. It deep cleans my pores but doesn’t strip, dry, or irritate my skin. My skin is brighter, softer, clearer, cleaner, and happier."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,This was only ok. Didn’t do much for my skin. Will not buy again
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Oh heck yes!,"I have found my new favourite face wash!!! I have combination skin and so sometimes it's hard to find a cleanser that equally deep cleans, as it does moisturizes. Will continue to buy this product. :)"

FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,My husband and I both love it!,"I use this cleanser in the shower with my electric face brush and have repurchased it time and time again.  I noticed that I was running out sooner than I should've and come to find out, my husband was using it too.  Now it's a staple in our shower products and he panics when we're running low! It's gentle enough not to break my acne prone skin out, yet powerful enough to clear the blackheads my husband tends to get on his nose without stripping his skin."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,"Foamy, superior clean","I love love love this cleanser!! I use it in the shower in the shower, and it foams so well, and cleans without stripping my skin! The best part is, you only need a tiny dot of cleanser to get the job done, so this bottle will last forever!"
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Singapore,nice but not amazing ,"The formula is great for oily skin type, it helps to remove dirt and sweat nicely without overly drying the skin. I’m still trying others face wash to see if there is one that won’t make my skin get oily too fast."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,A clean product that works great with my skin. It cleans out my pores and leaves my skin super smooth. The product smoothed my skin in just one week of use.
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,"The smell is amazing. The texture is great. You only need a little to use and it foams up really well. The only thing is that it made me break out. I have acne-prone and sensitive skin, so I thought it was just me. But then my husband also tried it and his skin is usually flawless and it made him breakout also. Sorry to say, I will not use again."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,My Fave,I cannot imagine anyone writing a bad review for this product. It’s the first and only product I’ve used until the end of the container and am now ordering more. It’s fresh and clean. My skin feels amazing after washing. I have tried every single thing on the planet as I have a unique combo of oily skin with rosacea and it’s felt almost impossible to find anything gentle that doesn’t either make my skin break out from not actually cleansing deeply enough or flare up because it’s cleansing too deeply. This is the perfect in between for me.
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Fabulous! Dispensing not fab.,"I absolutely love this cleanser! It smells fantastic. I have oily skin and wear make up, and this is one of the few cleansers that really does a great job removing make up. My only complaint is that it is hard to squeeze out of the tube. I think it is because it is just too thick. I have used this cleanser for quite some time but I am thinking of switching for this reason. Anyone else experienced this issue or find it annoying? Wish they would change their packaging to accommodate this thicker cleanser."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Love this product! Lathers on nicely & cleans off makeup very well. Be aware it does dry your skin out a little.
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Great for Combo skin!,I LOVE this cleanser for my combination skin type! Smells and feels great!
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Not bad but not great either,"I absolutely LOVE the Farmacy line! But this was just okay for me. It feels great and doesn't have an offensive scent, but it feels like it strips my skin just a little too much. I have oily skin with some dryness and this cleanser was no friend to my face. I will say that the other products I have from Farmacy are straight fire."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Lasts forever because a little goes a long way. Nice light scent and great texture on my skin. Foams a little.
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Best cleanser EVERR,I recently changed my skincare routine & added this face wash.. and it is AMAZING. I use a spinning brush & a little goes a long way! It foams up super nicely and leaves my face so soft and clean! Love love love & I will never switch facial cleansers
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,finally found it,"Finally found a wash that’s strong enough to remove my hormonal acne and yet leaves my face soft and moisturizer. I use it every day with the toner. Just use a good moisturizer after, but finally gone with the mask and monthly acne ! So good"
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,"I bounce around a lot between cleansers cause I’m not super picky.

FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,AMAZING,"I am hooked. This stuff is SO GOOD. My favourite part is that you need a very small amount to wash your entire face, even with makeup. Leaves skin feeling clean without that dry, stripped feeling. I was so tired of having to double cleanse just to remove makeup. The price of this is a bit high, but it will for sure last a long time."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Dreamy Cleanser,"Super lovely cleanser. Silky whipped up foaming texture with a light, inoffensive scent. Think soft, vagely fruity & lightly fizzy. Love it and will repurchase."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,simply the BEST,Absolutely the best! I use everyday after work and My face feels the cleanest! And it doesn’t dry my face out!
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,"I bought this because I really love the melt away makeup remover by Farmacy, but it is not great. It is very hard to get the product out of the tube and it is not as that good."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Staple,"My go-to face wash. I have tried just about every face wash under the sun, and this one is my absolute favorite. It really cleans without over stripping the skin. I struggle with acne and I simplified my routine to wash, treatment and moisturizer. My face was the clearest using this wash. I briefly stepped away to try their other face wash, bee clean and wasn’t as impressed."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,"clear, soft skin!","This stuff is the bomb! It takes off all my makeup, has the perfect amount of froth and leaves my skin feeling sooooo soft. I’ve seen a reduction in acne congestion on my cheeks which I couldn’t be happier about. And it definitely does not strip the skin, it has more of a moisturizing effect. I seem to go through it faster than other face washed but I just can’t stop using it. In love!"
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,10/10 recommend! I've been using this for about a month and my face feels great!!!
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,makes skin sensitive,"It's a meh. The cleanser doesn't melt very easily, even with water, it still remains chucky. It cleans ""too well"", so leaves my skin dry. After using it for 3 months now, I notice my skin is getting sensitive around the eye/cheek area, so i stopped using it. The tube is huge so I don't know what I'm gonna do with the remaining half."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Never again,I loved this cleanser until it got into my eye. I’ve never felt worse pain in my eye. It was horrible. Never using it again. I don’t know how this can be a face cleanser and burn your eye so badly. Don’t know how this hasn’t happened to anyone else before…
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,my perfect face wash!,"I love this face wash! When i got this the first time was in a boxycharm and i have just repurchased this like a few months ago. I actually have normal to dry skin and this is perfect, especially with the green clean balm and the honey halo moisturizer! Honestly this lathers up so well, smells good, and i just cant say enough good things!"
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,"Not too stripping but leaves your skin completely clean and free of makeup, grease, dirt, etc. 

Really helped me with congestion in my cheeks and breakouts! Love this cleanser!!"
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,drying,"Too drying even on my combo skin.  Also, it smells like public bathroom soap.  I like this line, but not this cleanser."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Smells and feels divine! A must-have,I cannot say enough good things about this cleanser and farmacy. I had a small sample of this and immediately bought the full size. I am now on my second bottle! It is so gentle and refreshing and my skin feels so soft after I use this. It’s clean and good for the planet and you only need a tiny tiny amount. I am so amazed at how little I actually need to use. I don’t plan on changing my cleanser anytime soon.
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Cleansing balm in a tube!,"Like all the Farmacy products I’ve tried, I loved this one. It acts like a cleansing balm more then a cleanser so I use this as my first cleanse to take makeup off. While it says it’s oil free, it is so gentle on the skin, and the scent is divine without being super strong. I will definitely repurchase after I’ve emptied this! It’s now a staple in my bathroom!"
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Malaysia,A cleanser that cleanses your face without drying,Love the texture of the cleanser and how it cleanses your face without drying your skin. 
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Great cleanser!,"I love that it has natural ingredients. My face feels soft and supple when I use this product, it doesn't dry out my skin like other cleansers."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,another Farmacy win,"I've recently discovered & fallen in love with Farmacy. I'm always on the lookout for clean brands & Farmacy products really deliver. I love this face wash! I have combination skin that tends to break especially in the t-zone. It's gentle, not drying & smells awesome (but not overpowering or lingering)."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Wonderful cleanser!,"I have dry allergic skin. Most cleansers leave my face flaking and in dire need of moisturizer.  This cleanser I can go without my moisturizer - no flakes! Now I use it on my neck and decolletage as well. Love it, love it, love it!"
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,I have super oily skin especially on my tzone. This cleanser is amazinggg. I pair it with the Farmacy toner and moisturizer and in the end it makes my face feel super soft and it doesn’t feel/look oily. Plus a small amount of the cleanser goes a long way.
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Malaysia,holy grail,"Been using the Farmacy cleansing balm all these while and decided to give this a try. Cursing myself for not getting this sooner! It’s affordable, comes in quite a big bottle and a little goes a long way. A pea-sized amount is enough to foam up for the whole face. What i love about it is that it cleans but doesn’t strip my combination and yet sensitive skin. Definitely my only go to from now on. Farmacy never disappoints!"
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,so creamy!,So creamy! The smell is gorgeous! My favorite part about it is that it doesn’t leave my skin dry after I use it!
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,"Nothing special, does its job.","This is a cleanser that does its job and nothing else more.  I double cleanse first with and oil, and then use this.  It doesn't leave my skin dry, and it does an ok job at cleansing. I prefer the Youth to the People Superfood Cleanser over this.  However, a little goes a long way and this bottle will last a very long time.  I use a pea size amount.  I bought this 3 months ago and I use it every night.  I still have over 2/3 of the bottle left."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,So Good!,This is such a good face cleanser. It’s not drying or stripping and it removes everything. A little goes a long way so this stuff will last you. It does not have a strong smell at all and is not irritating.

FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,I’ll buy it again,"The texture is fluffy, foamy, and pleasant. It exfoliates without drying, perfect for combination skin. The scent is also light but lovely."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,perfect for oily skin!,The best cleanser i've used by far! It helps with oil control and leaves my skin feeling fresh.
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,This cleanser works so well for my skin. My skin was getting dry as I was using salicylic acid during summer/fall and I always get so stumped in winter as to why my skin is dry. So important to change our cleansers especially if you have acne prone skin like me. Bought a sample size of this and haven’t tried anything else. 3 months in and my skin is so soft. Never feels dry or stripped of my natural oils but most importantly my skin feels clean. Definitely worth the buy
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Good but drying,Overall I like this cleanser but my skin always feels dry and tight afterwards. I get that with a lot of cleansers but this one is more than the rest.
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Singapore,Love!,Really love this cleanser so much. I use this as my second cleanse after using the cleaning Green Clean Balm. Best combo! 
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Nice cleanser,I got this in my boxycharm box. I don’t know that I would pay the full price for this face wash but it’s products like these that make my box worth it. So far it’s been really gentle but effective at cleansing my skin. I haven’t noticed any changes in my skin but I do like how it feels when I wash my face. It has an interesting texture that I enjoy very much and leaves my skin feeling smooth.
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,solid but maybe not worth it :o,"this is a nice cleanser but tbh, i don't know if it's worth the money because i haven't noticed any huge improvement in my skin due to it. the formula is nice and foams up really really well but i feel like it's effects are v basic - it cleans my skin and removes my makeup. there are def other cleansers you can get at similar a price point that offer more imo."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,deep clean and nourishing,This is the first product I have ever used that has fully cleaned my combination skin and left my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I think this is due to its cleansing balm like texture for the hydration and the foaming to get out the oils. I am super picky with cleansers and this is definitely my favorite I have ever used
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Incredible! I use this foaming cleanser after the green clean makeup cleansing balm and it cleans and refreshes my shin so well. I follow it with the deep sweep toner for mega-clean pores. Totally recommend it.
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,"Love it! It cleared up my acne so well, it smells fresh and a little product goes a long way."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Perfect for a face wash and really don't need to use a lot !
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,"I love this cleanser! I struggle with sensitive, dry skin and this product is one of few that doesn't leave me red and sore"
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,A MUST HAVE,"Absolutely amazing for my skin type! I have dry and dull skin, along with a lot of bumps and pores. This cleanser makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated. I would recommend this to anyone with a similar skin type!"
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Average Face Wash,Average performance as a face wash and therefore way overpriced for what it is.  My skin is combination so the good news is that this face wash is gentle enough for the normal to dry areas of my skin.
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,My favorite cleanser,This cleanser smells great and is incredibly effective. I have blackheads on my nose and the first time I used this cleanser I was shocked because I could no longer see them after washing with this. I use it as a double cleanser with the Farmacy Cleansing Balm and my blackheads have decreased significantly and my skin feels great!
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Nothing Special,"Unimpressed. This is like a worse, foaming version of the Green Clean. Foams similarly to many asian beauty cleansers. Didn’t seem to cleanse super well and every time I used it my nose would get dry and chapped. Honestly I’m confused as to this addition in the Farmacy line, as Clean Bee is an excellent foaming cleanser."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Don’t get the hype,"Don’t really get the hype and all the 5-star reviews on this cleanser. I got this cleanser because of all the positive reviews but compared to my staple cleanser (shiseido & fresh) this really falls behind. It’s a basic cleanser that foams and cleans the same way a drug store cleanser does. I expect my cleanser to not just clean but have some skincare benefit, this is true for my shiseido and fresh cleansers but NOT true for this cleanser. You’re over-paying for a cleanser that really does the bare minimum. Also after washing with this cleanser I noticed my face has a residue that won’t come off no matter how much water I use."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,This is my go-to face wash. It smells so good and is gentle on the skin
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,"I love this cleanser. I switched over from the Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel, which, quite frankly I loved at first but fell short for me after months of using it. This Whipped Greens cleanser makes my skin feel so fresh and genuinely clean after using. It’s a creamy texture that lathers well and works amazingly for my combo skin. Some people might be sensitive to the papaya enzyme though (the exfoliating element) so be cautious if you have drier skin as this may not be for you!"
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Blew my mind,"I bought this because I saw the kit with the toner a little while ago and I wanted to use the toner on my nose. I honestly forgot I had the cleanser because I have mostly dry skin except my nose. I decided to try it out just now in the shower and holy moly, it blew my mind. It cleaned out so much of my nose pores that the majority went from visible to invisible. I can't believe I only just tried it now. I did do a double wash with it because it felt gentle enough and I wanted to get deep like an exfoliant without the harshness. It feels super soft and didn't feel any different than a regular cleanser but when I saw myself in the mirror then my jaw dropped. Definitely going to keep with using my regular youth to the people cleanser for the rest of my face because of my dry skin but for my nose this is my go to/holy grail from now on."
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Everything I’ve been looking for!,"I’ve gone through a lot of cleansers some professional from  spas and esthetician offices some from the drugs store and everywhere in between.

This cleanser feels amazing!! consistency & lather feel like a thick velvety balm that transforms into a beautiful soft foam with out over stripping my face. The smell is very soft and pleasant. The clean this provided me felt like nothing I’ve spent 50+$ on with expensive cleansers. I am 30, with combination to oily skin. My skin does become slightly more dry in the winter as I’m sure some people experience as well. For me this was a 10/10 I hope then never discontinue this because I’d happily buy over and over again. For me this is my new staple face cleanser I will be sharing this with my girl friends and family to try who have similar skin as me. 

I uses a cleansing balm to remove my eyelashes and eye makeup only at the end of the night with a mild dove soap. I don’t put this on my eyes. I can’t say if it would irritate them or not so exercise some caution with that and see how you fair. Other wise for me this was a home run!"
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Not for me,"I waited 2 1/2 months to write the review for this product. I really wanted to love it—this product feels so nice on your skin and lathers to a nice consistency. However, this made me break out pretty bad. I have never purchased a cleanser that made me breakout quite like this, so I really never thought the cleanser was the issue. About a week ago I decided to try a different one to see if that was what the problem was, and my skin started to calm down within just two days of changing my cleanser. I am unsure of which ingredient caused it, but it’s a no from me sadly. I really wish this would have worked for my skin!"
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Received this cleanser in my Boxycharm a few months ago and finally started using it this week and I love it! This is my new favorite cleanser. A little bit goes a long way and leaves my face feeling very clean. Can’t wait to try the moisturizer too.
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Impressive,"I love how mild and soft this cleanser is . Yet due to the foaming it cleans the skin pretty well . Impressed . 
Also does not leave my skin dry after wash which I mostly faced with my previous cleanser . Definitely a keeper"
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,USA,Effective and gentle,"This is a phenomenal cleanser if your skin is normal to oily. It has a fresh fruit smell but doesn’t linger after washing it off. I used it with the fresh rose ultra hydrating toner and I’m telling you, it really got the red bumps off my face and made my skin healthy again. It gets all the impurities and makeup off. 5/5 I will repurchase!"
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,"Really nice cleanser! Doesn’t leave skin stripped or dry, it’s a great green creamy foam consistency and lathers very well. I feel this is similar to my fav laneige deep cleanser but doesn’t strip my skin as much as that one does but sometimes I like a squeaky clean so I will alternate between these two but definitely recommend this for combo skin people and leave a fresh clean without drying !"
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,This has converted me from drugstore cleansers. It leaves my skin feeling SO soft and absolutely zero tightness. A little goes a really long way--you barely need any for your face and neck
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,So soft and gentle! I have combo skin and this cleanser is my new favourite for the winter months. My skin feels so soft after washing!!
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Not for me,I got this as a free item with Boxycharm and first impression wasn't bad I like the creamy texture of the product and the smell but started breaking out and noticing around my eyes and mouth were dry and kinda sensitive mainly around my eyes. I've been using it for almost 3 weeks now and I've decided to stop using it and go back to Cerave which wasn't causing me any issues.
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Dupe for Kate Somerville cleanser! I used to use that one everyday but because of the harsh ingredients I started developing cysts. I love that this Farmacy cleanser contains the same enzymes but remains gentle and non-overdrying for everyday use.
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Holy Grail Cleanser,Hands down one of my all time favourite cleansers. Gentle enough to use day and night if needed and leaves me face feeling clean but not totally stripped of my natural oils. I use it in combination with the FARMACY Green Clean Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm and they work like a dream together. I would 10/10 recommend this product for someone who is new to skin care or someone who wants to try a new cleanser in their daily routine. I have combination/oily skin and this worked wonders for me.
FARMACY-Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Whipped Greens oil-free foaming cleanser,"My favorite cleanser I’ve used so far. I love the lather that it gives me and smell is nice and gentle. Even though it’s targeted for normal-combo-oily, my skin doesn’t feel stripped after I use it."
FRESH-Day & Night Hydration (Christmas Limited Edition),Singapore,good value set!,"Bought it during sales, it's a good value. Comprise of my daily favorites - the overnight mask and soy facial wash. The overnight mask feels nice on my combination skin without being greasy."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,"Totally recommend, is a lifesaver!","One of my fav cleaners, it makes my skin feel clean and not tired!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,Canada,If only the scent was nice!,Fabulous product other than the terrible smell.  Removed makeup including mascara and left my skin feeling great.  Really disappointed with the smell.
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,Canada,Took me by surprise,"I didn’t think I’d like this cleanser but I was wrong! The smallest, pea-sized amount gives you a full lather so this bottle should last forever. The water lily scent is strong but my skin hasn’t had a reaction to it, however definitely avoid the eye area. My skin feels clean without being overly stripped after using this. Not sure if its worth repurchasing yet but I’ll definitely finish the bottle I have."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,Canada,stay away,"smells nice but it started giving me tiny bumps on my forehead, no change in skincare routine or diet. don't buy it."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,here’s the deal…,"The lather isn’t bad. The texture is creamy on the skin. A smidge drying.. but wow that smell could gag a maggot. It’s not a horrible smell, but not what you’d expect from a brand like Dior. It is so dang strong of a smell that I was sick to my stomach. It’s not even a pretty Dior perfume smell. Smells have never bothered me but wow this was kickin. If you’re sensitive to smells, skip this. I use the Chanel version of this and it’s much better!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Not a fan - Returning,"Very drying, most likely because of that lovely scent. Nice lather but my face still felt dry even after putting on moistureizer."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,Canada,WOW! Wonderful Product.,"I've tried a lot of cleansers but this one is the best! With this one, my skin doesn't even ask for a moisturizer; even though my skin is on a dry side. After using it I just can't stop touching my face because it feels so silky, clean and healthier! And It removes the oil that I get during the day & night. Overall, the product is so smooth and foamy, it takes tiny amount to foam. Personally, the scent is very pleasant and sophisticated, reminds me of some natural & luxurious herbs :) Maybe it's just me... because I prefer to have scents in my skin care routine. I am very impressed because this is the first cleanser that doesn't resemble soap-like cleansing effect and in a gentle way gets its job done."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,ON,"I use a chickpea amount in my dry hands to lather up with water and cleanse my whole face and neck. Its creamy and thick but not as thick as La Mer’s cleanser—which smells and feels very similar to this. La Mousse is fluffy and moisturizing. It foams up nicely, but it’s not as thick as a Shiseido cleanser or micro-foam if that’s what you’re looking for. It also isn’t as sudsy as the Capture Totale (my favorite) is. It removed my leftover makeup well and cleansed my pores. I didn’t feel any tightness or drying and could comfortably apply my toner immediately afterwards. The scent remained for a little while, so it is fragranced but it’s a creamy fresh soap scent that isn’t bothering. Good amount for the price and designer too."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Nice & Clean,"The product I received was a good size, 150 ml or 5 oz.  A little goes a very long way.  The color of that product was white with a whipped lotion feel that foamed nicely when wet.  It had a nice clean scent reminiscent of Ponds or Oil of Olay.  Face felt clean and hydrated afterwards.  Very effective in removing makeup when used in conjunction with a cleaning tool. No need for a double cleanse.  I would definitely recommend this."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,"Great Product, strong scent","I love this face cleanser! It leaves my skin clean and shiny. The only inconveniente that I had with it is that if it gets close to my eyes, my eyes get irritated. The scent is too strong for my eyes, but overall it’s an okay product."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,Canada,Amazing,First time buying and using the product. Leaves my face smooth and moisturizer. It’s a thick texture and you just need a pea-sized amount
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"This is a nice cleanser, however for someone with dry skin it is pretty drying. I wouldn’t repurchase for that reason but for someone with oily skin it could work great. It cleanses really well, gets makeup off and does make your skin feel really clean. It foams to a luxurious lather and has a pretty strong scent."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,Canada,IN LOVE,The smell- the name - I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,New Zealand,Great item!,"The scent has a beautiful rose scentreminiscent of Shiseido cosmetics.
It foams well and removes makeup well.
After washing, my face is smooth and moisturized.
Highly recommended!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Hurt my face,"I like the brand But this foam is hurting my face While I was using and after 
I try to continue use it think maybe my skin need some time to adjust but after almost 3 weeks. I think I need to return it and find the right one that fit me."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Pretty Good,"I received this on Influenster exchange for my review. I think this cleanser is good, but it takes some time getting used to. The smell is really florally and perfumy, but it settles in later. It did help keep my skin clear as I have been using this for over a month. I think I might repurchase again."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,i likey,"I started to test this before I got my lash extensions done and then I’d use it sparingly since I wanted to be careful in general but the times I was using it I did enjoy it. It feels really gentle and soft and lathers well too. It has that high end fragrance that most high end makeup has but it doesn’t bother me like those do because this one feels a bit softer of a scent. I actually enjoy the smell since it smells clean and fresh yet feminine. But if you’re someone who is sensitive to smells, you might wanna steer clear of this one. One other thing I also am enjoying is my skin does feel soft after I rinse it off and I’m a sucker for that! As for moisturizing I have combo/oily skin so I haven’t really kept track of how much a difference it makes so i’m not 100% sure on that. You do get a ton of product since it’s a big bottle and you don’t have to use all that much so it will last but it is a bit pricey. You can find ones that work similarly or better for a way better price so it’s totally up to personal preference if you wanna splurge or not."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Off/On,"This cleanser from Dior comes in a large Sleek bottle, it features a removable twist bottom that dispenses the product. With a little water and gentle moment this cleanser goes from cream to bubbles a matter of seconds. A pleasant floral scent accompanies the suds. The wash leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean and does a thorough job of removing make up."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Luxurious cleanser!,"This cleanser is creamy and foams when water is added! It removes makeup but is gentle on the skin. After using it, my skin feels clean but not stripped or tight. I also like how the packaging is simple and elegant but also watertight and easy to use. However, it does have a strong perfume like scent. Personally, i enjoy the scent, but those sensitive to fragrance might wish to avoid!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Okay Cleanser,This face wash was okay. I enjoy using foam face washes but I did find that this one left my face feeling too clean. I feel like it stripped some of my natural oils away and made the skin dry. The scent is really strong almost rosy and powdery like talc.
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Great moisturizing cleanser!,"This is a very lovely cleanser! It foams up extremely well and really feels like it gets everything off of my face without stripping my skin. It was easy to take off my makeup using this as well! The after effect on your skin after using this product is something I’ve never experienced - my skin is moisturized and soothed, which is extremely welcome as my face typically feels very dry or stripped after washing with some cleansers! The only thing to be aware of is that the cleanser does have a scent to it. I do not mind this too much as it is a wash off product, but I do understand that some have sensitivities to scents in skincare products and prefer ones without a scent in them. The scent is very nice though, just a bit strong! I do also wish the price point was a bit lower, but you are paying for the brand name of Dior so I understand that! It is quite a big bottle however so it should last an extremely long time."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,eh but okay,"The only thing that truly stuck out to me was the classic Dior fragrance which is abundant. It has a cream based texture that turns into a foam which I like. However, the cleanser didn’t feel anymore effective than my normal routine. Love how much product you get and it does take off some make up. if you are already a Dior-girl then you’ll love this. For me though it was just okay."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Luxe!!,"Super luxe, foamy, creamy, and has a luxurious scent. A little goes a long way! Leaves my pores feeling clean and skin feels very hydrated. Will definitely repurchase."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Dior Does It Again,"Dior La Mousse OFF / ON is the perfect option for those looking for a luxury cleanser that has it all in one simple, chic bottle. This cleanser, with the essence of French water lily, removes makeup and impurities and instills deep hydration."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"I received this complimentary product from influester to try and give my honest opinion on. I have been using it for the past couple of weeks and I like it. It is gentle on the skin, cleanses well, and overall is good. It is a lot of product so it’ll last you awhile :)"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"I was pleasantly surprised with this cleanser! I wasn’t expecting to like it because sometimes you’re really just paying for the name with high end products, but it lathers really nicely and doesn’t leave my face feeling tight. It’s pretty gentle and doesn’t have much of a scent other than “soap”. The bottle is also pretty large so I feel this would last a decent amount of time. If you have the money to spend, go for it!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Great!,"I am in love with this cleanser!!! It’s gentle enough for my morning and night skincare routine. I love the scent as well, it’s very minimal. I have seen such good results in little less than a month."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Great cleanser!,"This cleanser left my face feeling fresh and clean! It had a smooth consistency and wasn’t too heavy on the skin, and left my skin feeling moisturized and not dry. It has a nice scent and is made of cleaner ingredients as well. I would definitely recommend this cleanser although it is a bit pricey! I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,A Great Foaming Cleanser,"I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. When I saw I was receiving a foaming cleanser, I was a bit nervous about how my sensitive skin would react. However, this product works gently and leaves my skin feeling soft and still hydrated. It has a light, fresh fragrance, creamy application, and a little goes a long way. I do make sure to apply a deep moisturizer following use and recommend only using 1-2 times per week for those with more sensitive skin."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Excellent Cleanser,A little of this cream goes a long way. It seems thick and heavy as it comes out of the tube but it transforms into a light and refreshing foam. It does have a scent that lingers even after its washed off. I quite like the scent and don't mind it at all; I find it refreshing and perfume like (in a good way IMO). The cleanser was complimentary from Influenster.
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Creamy and rich,"Unlike most foam cleansers, this one was creamy and rich and left my skin feeling clean.  The smell was a little more fragrant than what I prefer but its a nice product."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,One of the best cleansers I've used,"This product is amazing, I've been using it for the past few weeks right after removing my make up and I'm in love. When combined with water it produces a soft foam. The fragrance smells so good, it's not overpowering and it leaves the skin with a nice scent. My skin is a combination of oily and dry and I feel that this products helps it clean and balance the hydration. I would definitely buy it again."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Great,"I received this product for free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love that more brands are trying to use less irritating, and more natural ingredients. This cleanser did a great job of getting my skin clean without stripping it."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Definitely worth the price!,"Though higher than your average facial cleanser this is definitely NOT your average cleanser!  II love it! You only need a small amount to cover your whole face. My face felt so fresh, clean and not dry. The fragrance is light but so nice and not overwhelming. Permanent addition to my skincare routine...I highly recommend this, it is worth every dime!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"really great cleanser, my skin didn’t feel right and dry after using, but i wish the fragrance wasn’t as strong. id stay away if you’re sensitive to fragrance!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"I have thoroughly enjoyed using this cleanser, and so has my sensitive skin. This cleanser is gentle enough on my drier skin but still washes off all my makeup in one go. It’s creamy, foamy, and has a pleasant aroma to it. The container is aesthetic and is easy enough to squeeze out the cleanser. I would definitely recommend this if it is in your price range"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,I have combination skin and absolutely love this face wash! Overall I would recommend this to anyone and everyone! Also the smell is absolutely amazing!
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"A little definitely goes a long way with the
Dior OFF/ON Foaming Cleanser. It easily
removed my makeup and left my face
feeling soft and moisturized. The scent is
light and clean and didn't irritate my
sensitive skin. I will definitely be
purchasing once I'm out!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Added to the daily routine!,"I think this cleanser is a great staple to have in your routine. I feel like the cleanser made my skin refreshed and brightened. I do have slightly dry skin, so with claims of hydration I had high hopes. I wouldn’t say I felt dryer than other cleansers, but I hoped for a little more hydration. Still a really solid option and I’ve been using it every day since I got it. A little goes a long way which is great for a higher price point cleanser! Definitely recommend."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,My Favorite New Face Wash!,"I have fallen in love with this wonderful product! I actually look forward to using it . My face feels so fresh and clean after using it , and my skin looks radiant. I also really love the fragrance , which is very light, and not at all overwhelming.

DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,a little goes a long way !,"I was between cleansers when I got this product. I tend to use my cleansers with my Clarisonic brush to get optimal results . With this product I felt like my skin got an amazing deep clean that removed the dead skin cells the dry patches and calmed my rosacea . Which is wear because after a cleans my skin usually gets irritated and red . But with this one it’s the opposite. It felt calm clean and refreshed . 

I liked the light scent of it and loved that a little dot got so much work done . It worth the price and it’s going to be a staple in my routine . My skin feels radiant and refreshed after every cleanse ."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,great cleanser!,"This is an overall great cleanser! I love that it’s alcohol free so it doesn’t dry out my skin like other cleansers can. It is lightly scented so if that affects you, I would avoid this product."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Dior La Mousse OFF/OFF Foaming Face Cleanser,"I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion and review. 

The product is packaged in an elegant white tube placed inside a white sleek box. It has a nice creamy texture and foams up nicely when applied to your face with water. It left my face and neck feeling clean, soft, moisturized and smooth. There was no dryness or tightness like I’ve experienced with some cleansers. I’ve been using it for over a week and I still have almost a full tub. You only need a small amount to thoroughly cleanse your face. The only thing I do not care for is the fragrance and the amount of time it takes for it to wear off. I would recommend this product."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Dior Dior!,I absolutely love this product. I’m super hesitant about face products because I tend to lean towards higher end products. Thankfully this product delivered and left my very oily skin feeling balanced and not overly dry.
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Gentle effective cleanser,I received this product complimentary of influenster for my honest review. I thought this was a good cleanser! I liked the consistency and the scent. It made my skin feel clean and refreshed. I have combination skin and this doesn’t dry me out or make me oily. I would probably use this in the morning as I prefer more of an exfoliant in the evening. A bit pricey but a good option!
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Great cleanser,"This is a great cleanser without alcohol, parabens and sulphates. It lathers well and only a small amount does the work. It cleans makeup and impurities without making the skin dry. My face feels very clean and soft. This cleanser leaves my skin clean, beautiful and hydrated."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,must have,I personally love scented skin care this product has a water lily scent and very soft scent I love that fact that the product  leaves my skin so fresh and hydrated… the contains is very simple and elegant and I love the fact that a little goes a long way definitely recommend it
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,It is such an adorable bottle!! It looks good hidden away or put out! It smells absolutely amazing and clean! Feels good!
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,Love this face wash. It took my mascara off after one wash. I usually have trouble with this with other face soaps. I also haven’t had a break out since using it
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Super clean,"I hadn't tried this facial cleanser before, but I really liked it.  It is very clean, without alcohol, parabens and sulfates.  It is a cream with which I can clean my face of makeup and impurities without any problems.  This cleanser leaves my skin clean, beautiful and hydrated.  I like it very much."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"I absolutely love this face wash, I definitely recommend it. It lathers well and you only need a small amount. My face feels very clean and soft, my skin looks good. My daughter has problems with acne, after using this a few days her face is completely clear. Amazing product!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Thumbs up,Overall I enjoyed this cleanser. It was lightweight and has a very nice subtle scent. It did not leave my skin overly dry or feeling greasy. I received this for free for reviewing purposes.
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,this cleanser is just ok. i’m not a fan of the scent at all. smells kind of like old lady floral perfume but other than that it comes in a large squeeze tube which is nice but I do t think it does anything above and beyond
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Beautiful and luxe,"Beautiful fragrant cleanser, it doesn’t stay on the skin so it doesn’t bother me and I’m sensitive to fragrances. Foams well, cleanses without drying my skin. I like to use this as my second cleanse at the end of the day."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Basic Cleanser,"I was not super impressed with this face wash. The texture of it is nice, the fragrance, though strong, is nice. It was a gentle cleanser, but I don’t think would work for anyone with oily skin. It’s just not worth the price in my opinion"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Strong Smell,"Though I wanted to love this cleanser (since the formula itself works quite well with my skin), the fragrance was simply too much to bear. It’s an extremely strong fake floral scent, and it simply doesn’t leave your face. I highly recommend this product if you’re okay with fragrance, but if you’re not, definitely don’t get this product!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Dior ON/OFF Foaming Cleanser:,"I love how sleek and pretty this cleanser looks! Such a beautiful addition to ones vanity! Plus, It feels luxurious on the skin. A small amount goes a long way! Extremely hydrating and moisturizing for the skin. This cleanser is made from 90% natural ingredients, and formulated with purified water Lilly, which aid in removing dirts and impurities. 
Thank you influenster and Dior for sending this complimentary product over!

@Dior @Diorbeauty @Influenster"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,STRONG Scent!,"Although this is a beautiful cleanser for my normal/combo skin, and leaves my skin cleansed but still moisturized, I’m unable to use it because the floral scent is SO strong. I love and prefer scented skincare products, but this lingered on my skin even after putting all of my skincare on. If you can tolerate the scent, though, this is a beautiful cleanser!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Highly Recommend! Worth the Investment,"I am a HUGE fan of Dior’s beauty products and was thrilled to receive the OFF/ON Foaming Cleanser to test from Influenster.  Like the other Dior skincare products I’ve tried, this product does what it claims to do! It washes the day away, leaving my face fresh, clean, and hydrated.  The cleanser is rich in texture but delicate enough for sensitive skin, effortlessly removing makeup, harsh impurities, excess oil/sebum, and the environmental stressors that clog pores and leave my skin looking dull, dry, and tired.   Once again, I am blown away by Dior’s ability to deliver a super lux product that delivers on its promise with innovative ingredients and chic packaging. While it is pricey, a little goes a long way, and I believe the results are worth the investment."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Gentle cleanser.,Love this face wash. I have sensitive skin and had no issues with this formula. Gently removed my makeup in a rich lather. A little bit goes a long way.
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Cleansing & Hydrating,"I really enjoyed this facial cleanser as it was very gentle for my sensitive skin. There is a very light, natural scent, which was refreshing and not overpowering. In terms of clearing my skin of debris and oil, it’s probably the best cleanser I’ve used. While it’s tough on grime, it’s not tough on your skin. I have combination skin, which is difficult when selecting a product. Oftentimes, my skin becomes too oily or too dry; however, this product has the right balance. I would put gothic product in the future."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Like luxe bar soap,"I'm still not 100% sure how I feel on this. I love the elegant packaging, with clean lines and a sleek profile -- not just pretty, it fits perfectly on the tiny shelves in my apartment shower. It also has a fantastic texture: add a little water (even cold) and it foams up wonderfully in the hands, and it doesn't leave your face feeling tight or unclean. Definitely more of a soapy/bubbly lather than a rich, creamy one if you do it in your hands like me, but it's still thick enough to do the trick. A little goes a long way and the bottle is a nice, big size (so I don't feel bad washing twice in a row on those days I really need it!) At night I use it after an oil balm cleanser, or just by itself if I'm too tired and didn't wear makeup. In the AM it's on its own for cleansing.
The downside: The fragrance is pretty strong. It's not like a floral perfume, just straight-up powdery lily, but not being particularly sensitive to fragrances, I don't mind too much after using it for a few weeks. The scent is a bit like cheap bar soap, but such is the nature of any floral water. If you are sensitive to fragrance: steer clear. It didn't do anything for my acne, but it didn't make it worse, either. I've been pretty bad about my diet, hydration, and sleep recently (exams stress season is upon us) though, so take this with a grain of salt!
I wouldn't recommend this to people uninterested in brand names, simply because the price point/fragrance combo for what it is, but it you don't mind splashing out a bit for the feeling of luxury in your daily routine it isn't a bad choice (again, it's a good-size bottle). If you don't mind a strong floral... Also wouldn't recommend if you're looking for active skincare in your cleanser. Not sure if I'd buy it again for myself (mosty because I'm still attached to my previous one), but I fully intend to use every last drop!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"This cleanser works well to remove traces of makeup. It does leave the face feeling a little dry and tight, but I feel like it’s a good cleanser."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,This just feels so luxurious on the skin. I typically have sensitive skin and this didn’t cause any irritation or breakouts. I wouldn’t recommend using this if you typically use a facial cleanser to remove eye makeup as well.
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,I like!,"Overall I liked this facial cleanser.  I put a small amount into my palm, mixed until somewhat foamy and then applied to my face. I like the moisturizing factor and how it makes my face feel soft afterward. I would recommend."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Won’t dry your skin,Dior kindly gifted me the off/on foaming cleanser to try out and review. This foaming cleanser has a thick consistency and foams up quite a bit. A little product has been plenty for my second cleanse after an oil cleanser. It feels really nice during and after application and doesn’t dry my face out. I also like the clean scent it has.
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,This is my new favorite face wash. It didn’t dry out my skin but cleaned all the makeup off. My face was nice and smooth
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,cleansing to the max,I have very sensitive skin so finding a cleanser that actually does the job and doesn’t dry out or irritate my skin is hard but this cleanser does the job and doesn’t leave my skin feeling leathery or dry. It has a pleasant smell and love the way it washes away impurities.
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Dior Cleanser,This is a good face cleanser. It’s lightweight and a little goes a long way. It’s nice to add something new to my collection and I’m happy that it doesn’t irritate the skin. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to experiment more with their skincare routine and who is looking to try a new skin cleanser.
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"The packaging is minimal which I enjoy and the size is amazing. The cleanser itself was actually surprising, it foamed well enough but it actually left my skin feeling fresh and not stripped dry in the least. Pleasantly surprised! The only gripe I have is that the cleanser is quite thick so that it was hard to squeeze out of the tube"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"I enjoyed sampling this product. It’s just the right thickness, and the scent reminds me of the perfume my mom used to wear, Wind Song. A little goes a long way. My face feels clean and smooth after using it."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"I got this product from influenster to do a review: The texture felt smooth & silky & I absolutely love foaming cleansers like this. The product works great, it’s great on my sensitive skin. I didn’t notice any skin irritation or redness after using it which is a plus for me. It left my face looking healthy & refreshed. I don’t really like scents in skincare but this fragrance was actually nice, it was not overpowering it felt clean. I do have dry skin & felt like it kinda left my skin
Dry after using it. But compared to other cleansers I’ve tried before this didn’t leave my face feeling extremely dry or anything like that. I also was able to use serum & moisturizer after the cleanser & my face felt hydrated & looked nice. It felt like it did a great job as a cleanser it got dirt, oil & makeup off, everything off my face it was like feeling the benefits of having a deep cleanser without abrasiveness or skin irritation.  I also love the bottle it’s pretty huge for a face cleanser it kinda looks like an classy yet simple packaging. I recommend this product I think it does a great job as a cleanser it felt nice on my skin, it felt like my skin had a deep clean, I was able to remove all my makeup, skin oil & dirt. It worked good on my sensitive skin & didn’t cause any irritation. The scent actually smelled good & wasn’t overpowering Those are my main reasons why I liked this product and would recommend"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Smells good but fairly stripping.,"I received this product in exchange for my honest review from Influenster 
Per the website’s description “A soothing face cleanser that removes makeup, oil, and impurities while preserving hydration for clean pores and comfortable, hydrated skin.” I have to say that for me, I found this cleanser to be rather stripping. My face feels dry after use. I have oily skin and sensitive skin, the pro’s are that this product didn’t give me a reaction or make me break out. The smell is light and pleasant with a satisfying lather. The bottle is massive and a bit bothersome with its huge twist off cap. But it feels like you get a good amount of product for the price. I wouldn’t repurchase as it doesn’t really do anything positive for my skin."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"The packaging is very simple but at the same time attractive. Since the tube is wide and unusually slim, it is extremely easy to get the cleanser out of this packaging without having to do a lot of squeezing. 

You’ll only need a tiny amount each time so the product will last you a long time. I love the consistency of this product and how it transforms into a luxurious, creamy foam once it is mixed with water. The cleanser deeply cleanses the skin and gets rid off make up without having to do a lot of rubbing. A lot of foam cleaners leave my skin feeling dry and tight but not this one! La Mousse cleanses without stripping the skin and leaves my dry skin feeling hydrated and soft!

La Mousse Off/ On contains 90% natural origin ingredients which is always a plus in my book but it unfortunately contains fragrance. I don’t mind scented skincare products but the scent of this cleanser is too strong for me. Besides the strong, perfume like scent, I really enjoy using this cleanser. If Dior decides to make an unscented version of this product, I would most definitely purchase it."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Pros and Cons list,Pros for me it didn’t strip my skin and foams up nicely there was no break outs when I began using this product either and now onto the cons the scent smelled like a dove bar soap to me and it didn’t take off all my makeup but it did take a good chunk of it off. In my personal opinion for the price point I probably won’t go out and buy it just to pay for the brand name.
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Gotta love this cleanser!!,"First of all, this cleanser smelt clean and fresh.Also, it made my skin feel so smooth and hydrating. I’m glad I received this product for free from Influenster! Plan on buying in the future."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Nice Cleanser,"It’s hard to find a face wash that effectively cleanses your skin without leaving it feeling stripped and dry, while most hydrating cleansers don’t feel like they clean very well and leave a film on my skin. This cleanser is different. The consistency is unique. It is a little bit like a cream and foaming cleanser in one. It thoroughly cleanses my skin without stripping it and there was no heavy residue left after rinsing. My skin feels hydrated and comfortable after use. I like that it’s composed of 90% natural origin ingredients. I also like the claims that it removes 99% of pollution particles and reduces the effects of pollution by half. It makes me feel like I’m getting added benefits on top of just cleansing my skin. Though it does have a fragrance, it’s not overpowering and disappears shortly after you rinse your face. The only con I have is the added fragrance which I try to avoid in my skin care because it can be irritating. The scent doesn’t bother me any but I would prefer it being fragrance free. Otherwise this is a very nice cleanser that leaves my skin feeling clean and comfortable after use."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"I started using this cleanser 2 times a day as soon as I got it. I was initially really nervous with how strong the scent was , but after using you don’t even notice it, and ive come to really the the scent. My boyfriend even noticed that the scent stayed on all day with out it bothering me at all! I really love how light it feels and how well it foams up. Definitely will be adding as a staple to my everyday routine."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,I like the scent of this cleanser. It's not too strong. It cleans well and leaves my skin feeling kind of tight. I think it's a little drying for my skin. My normal cleanser is Rodan and Fields and it doesn't dry my skin out. It's creamy out of the bottle and foamy when wet. I received this product for free for my honest review.
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,THE BEST THERE IS,"First off, the smell. It is heavenly! Rich and luxurious. It has a powdery floral hint that reminds me of my grandmother (and this is a most positive highlight of the product for me!). Next, it is so foaming and makes a great bubbly lather. A little tiny bit goes a long way! Perfect, because I never want to run out! Lastly, it really cleanses your skin. I feel fresh faced and actually relaxed after using this! I love it!!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Just okay,This cleanser does what it intends to do. My skin does feel clean afterwards but doesn’t do much to hydrate or correct any skin concerns I have. The formula and texture feel nice on the skin. It has an overwhelming perfume scent that I feel is unnecessary.. but if fragrance in skincare doesn’t bother you it shouldn’t be an issue. I don’t think I would purchase this product again.
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"I was so excited to receive Dior’s new cleanser for review and am happy to report that I really enjoyed it. It foams up beautifully with a very concentrated formula. A little goes a long way here, so there’s so need to use much more than a pea size amount. It easily removes all traces of makeup and oil, but does not leave the skin feeling stripped. If I could change one thing about it, I would turn the fragrance down a couple notches. Otherwise, I really enjoy this cleanser and would recommend for any luxury skincare lovers with normal skin type."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mixed review,I received this free in exchange for a review on influenster. The cleanser smells of ivory soap and was drying to my skin in comparison to my normal Elemis but I gifted it to my mom and she loves the smell and said he leaves her skin feeling soft.
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Awesome cleanser!,"I received this item for free to test/review from Influenster and Dior. I’ve been using this cleanser for almost a month and I love it. I don’t have to use a lot (About a pea size!), and it does a great job of removing my makeup. It’s very gentle on my combination/acne prone skin. It removes the oil, but still moisturizes my dry spots. :)"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,So good for dry skin!,"This feels so luxurious. There is a strong floral fragrance but I personally do not mind it. The face wash foams very easily and doesn't require much to clean the face. Also, it left my skin feeling so smooth and moisturized afterwards. I've been dealing with super dry/flaky skin and I was surprised it did not worsen it. The instructions say not to get it close to your eyes which I accidentally did and I can say it BURNS. It's a great cleanser otherwise!! I would highly recommend."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Love itt,"Dior has done it again with their La Mousse OFF/ON Foaming Face Cleanser! This cleanser lathers so well and always leaves my skin feeling oh so soft! I really enjoy how it removes all my makeup and leaves my skin feeling clean without stripping it dry. A classic Dior scent without being too overwhelming. It also didn’t irritate my sensitive skin- loved that! If you’re looking for a great cleanser which provides a luxury experience, this is the one!!!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Great,"I love this cleanser but for the price point, I wish it could offer more qualities like added minerals, hydration or did more than just cleanse your skin. Other than that, it’s a great cleanser and doesn’t leave your face feeling oily or dry. I received this product complimentary."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Very Nice,"Overall it’s a pretty solid cleaner. I usually use a face wash with salicylic acid,so I would not replace it with this one. I really like to use this when I have makeup on,because it does actually take the makeup off pretty well. I also use it to wash makeup off my hands after swatching and stuff. Mascara is a little harder to get off with this,but even then it gets off 80%. The scent is strong,but it’s what know you signed up for when you bought it. It doesn’t linger for long after you’ve washed your face. My skin feel pretty clean after I’ve used this"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,So luxe...,"I was sent this #complementary product for me to test in exchange for an honest review.  This is absolutely without a doubt the best cleanser that I've ever tried, ever!!.  I'm so impressed with the beautiful way in which a little absolutely goes a long way, also the scent is definitely entoxicating and envigorating.  The price point is the only thing that's not friendly at all, but for me if a product is effective in delivering results then I don't care if I have to spend a lot of money.  I recommend this wash because it doesn't strip my skin and it my face feels supple and moisturized.  I love it!.  Thanks to @influenster and #Dior!!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,My new go-to!,"Yes, this is my new go- to.  For years I’ve used an Estée Lauder product that’s similar- but after receiving and using this product morning and night, I’ve found it to be incredibly effective in cleansing my makeup up.  It leaves me feeling refreshed, clean, and frankly, luxurious.  The soft scent complements the refreshing feeling.  I definitely believe it is worth the splurge and certainly recommend it."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Luxurious! Worth the splurge!,"I personally loved this cleanser! My first Dior skincare product and I’m impressed with how luxurious it feels. It’s soft and has a great lather. The one thing that may be a downside for some is how heavily fragranced it is. It’s the strongest smelling cleanser I’ve ever used, like straight up perfume. I don’t mind it, especially since it makes my skin feel nice."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Works amazing!!,"I got this face wash from influenster for free in exchange of my honest review.I used this for 2 weeks before posting the review so as to have a better view of how this cleanser performed. Starting with the packaging, it looks elegant and feels luxurious. A pea size amount is enough to give a rich, smooth lather so this tube would last long. The fragrance is very subtle and not overpowering. After washing my face I was surprised how squeeky clean my face felt. It worked very well in cleaning the oiliness and makeup residuefrom the face.  I also noticed my nose was smooth and could see visible difference in white heads. This left my face feeling soft and fresh. I loved the overall experience of using this cleanser and this is definitely going to be my to go cleanser!!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"Gentle cleanser that removes makeup efficiently and leaves the skin feeling refreshed and clean without tightness. Floral smell, which isn’t personally my favorite, but still very pleasant"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"I really liked the texture of this facial cleanser - it is very foamy and smooth, and only a small amount is needed. It’s a great size bottle too! My only issue with it is that it smells like cheap hotel soap."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"I received this I'm exchange for my honest review, and honestly, I'm pretty happy. I always look at the price and see if I think it's worth the cost. In this case, I think it is. The smell was heavenly in my opinion and my face felt so clean and moisturized. I could see this replacing my usual daily fash wash. A little really goes a long way too."
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,DIOR La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,"I absolutely love @lancomeofficial mousse face wash and didn’t think I would love anything else, until @dior came through with their mousse face wash. I love the creamy feel, the smell, and how it made my face look. I feel like it got all the oil, food residue, spit + slobber my two toddlers usually leave on my face and it just felt so refreshed and soft. A great plus on the size as well!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Cleans without drying. Heavy scent.,"I have been using this product for a few weeks and I like it! It doesn't lather a lot, but it goes on smoothly and rinses cleanly. I don't feel like my face is too dry afterwards, either. It removes makeup easily.  The product has the consistency of a light lotion and a pretty heavy scent. Reminds me of perfume. If you prefer light or no scent, this cleanser is not for you. Overall, I would recommend it!"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Hydrating and easily takes makeup off,"This is easy to take my makeup off without rubbing at my skin. It’s not irritating or drying,  it’s gentle and hydrating"
DIOR-La Mousse Off/On Foaming Cleanser,USA,Great cleanser!,"This Dior OFF/ON cleanser is a nice cleanser to add to a routine. It's a super creamy and somewhat thick to start off. As you mix it with water and rub it onto your skin it feels creamy and foamy all at the same time! It glides across your skin and is very comforting. I found the scent of it to be pleasant and mild. I use it at nighttime since the cleanser also removes makeup. It does a good job at cleaning my skin. It rinses off well and gives my skin a ‘squeaky clean' feeling. It feels smooth and not dried out like other cleansers do. I normally use drug store makeup removers and cleansers; however, I might be repurchasing this cleanser instead. I like Dior makeup products a lot, and this cleanser performed even better than I expected. Although Dior products can be pricey, they noticeably are higher quality than other comparable options."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Will forever buy this!,"This is my holy grail for removing makeup or sunscreen. I have very sensitive, oily, blemish-prone skin (and rosacea), so I have to be careful with what I use. This removes it ALL and is so gentle on the skin."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,"I like this cleansing oil makeup remover it feel light in my face and do not dry my skin but my mom used it too and it make her skin a little dry, everyone have different skin type, overall I recommend it."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Drying and irritating,"I wanted to love it BUT it dried out my skin and irritated it
my skin was itchy and inflamed almost immediately"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Good oil cleanser,I received this product and exchange for honest review. Very light botanic fragrance. Removed mascara beautifully..
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Not for me but probably excellent for some.,"I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.
I wanted to love this--it smells amazing and I love how cleansing oils take away makeup and sunscreen without stripping skin. This one left my skin a bit dry, which is an odd thing in an oil-based cleanser. I suspect that for people with normal-to-oily and oily skin, this will be perfect. The  pump bottle is nice, and as part of a two-step cleansing routine this could be great--just not for me."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Makeup remover,Never used an oil cleaner before but I have to say this is cool. I like the scent of it and the fact it melts my stubborn makeup and the best part it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,So far so good,"So far it’s been great. I really like this product. Before this product, I was using Tatcha for 3 years, but I noticed in the past couple of months it would cause my face to get dry. Sulwhasoo does not and I love that it’s a lot more creamier? It does a really good job taking all my makeup off"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,A must have in my routine for sure,I received this product for free from influenster and sulwhasoo for free complimentary porpuse in exchange for my honest review after using this product pass few weeks  i am loving the result helped my dry skin feeling hydratet and remove the makeup is very easy with this formula higly recommed
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,"I have used few oil facial cleansers, I really liked how my face looked after applying it, the texture is light and the bottle with a single pump was enough because a lot of product came out, the bottle felt a bit weak, the makeup came out perfectly And best of all, my face felt very soft while I was removing the makeup and my skin did not turn red as it usually does.  I definitely add it to my facial routine I recommend this product"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,It's decent,"Beautiful packaging. Easy to open. Easy to travel in my skincare bag. Just put the stopper back on it so in the case of the pump applicator getting pushed it doesn't come out. One pump is all I needed. Isn't thick. Comes off easily with water and a cleansing cloth. Removes all my facial makeup. Not all my eye makeup though, but enough that it doesn't take much to remove the leftover makeup."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Amazing cleansing oil,I really like that it helps remove even waterproof makeup. That’s my least favorite part of my makeup routine removing makeup but this makes it effortless.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Must have product!,This product is amazing! Would definitely recommend! This has became a new routine for my daily schedule!! :)
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,A beautiful cleanser!,Love branching out to more Korean skincare! It’s the best and has a lot of hype for a reason! This product line included! I love that these come in a pump style bottle as it makes it easy to get the perfect amount and is less messy this way! This oil cleanser glides onto skin really nicely and washes the face well too! Very light scent which I’m okay with! Layers nicely with the other products from this line and left my skin feeling supple and hydrated!!
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Great cleansing oil,This is a great cleansing oil for on the go or traveling. It is TSA friendly. The oil is rich and takes off my makeup easily and with two pumps it really does cover the entire face. I think the tangerine extract gave me a brightne affect as well.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,"This was pleasantly easy to use. It removed my stubborn mascara and washed off nicely, leaving my skin feeling moisturized instead of dry like it usually is after washing. And the packaging is absolutely high end beautiful."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Good product but not my favorite,This is a good makeup removing oil but it doesn’t remove my waterproof mascara as easily as I’d like. I have to use it multiple times to get it off. Everything else comes off pretty good.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,This is nice,I love this. My skin feels so good after using this but be careful because if the bottle gets knocked over then you will loose most of it. The lid is kind of flawed it twists
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Doesn’t take off waterproof mascara well,I don’t like the smell of it. The smell is pretty strong. It feels nice but it does a terrible job at taking off my waterproof mascara. It takes everything else just fine except my mascara.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,I love it!,It removes my make up wonderfully and it doesn't make me breakout
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Ms ,Been using the cleanser. It’s my first purchase for their cleansing oil. Not too bad. It’s cheaper than Shu umera cleansing oil and it’s serve the same purpose. 
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,LOVE the work,"It thoroughly removes my make up from my face. It feels really good on my skin, too. One thing to remind is to be cautious around your eyes. It will get blurry and slightly uncomfortable because of the oil but it will go away like nothing happened after using a cleanser."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Game Changer,"this is the first oil cleanser I've ever tried, so there could be better ones out there, but it has been a total game changer for my skin. I don't wear makeup but I use this to take off sunscreen before the rest of my routine. i use it in the mornings too by itself. i've been struggling with buildup and dryness and clogged pores but this combined with the Biossance BHA toner is completely rejuvenating the texture and look of my skin. I like the smell and haven't noticed any irritation."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,I love this to remove my makeup. I’ve tried balms before but they irritate my eyes when I try to remove mascara or eyeshadow. This does not burn or bother my eyes and manages to remove all my mascara (I use waterproof). It did leak a little bit when I ordered it online which I saw was an issue for some however mine was not as significant. Would def recommend if you’re looking for a gentle but effective product!
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,"The best oil cleanser I’ve ever used. If you don’t mind an herbal scent, get this."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,ME NO LIKE,I hate it it’s too fragrant and it’s leaks everywhere and it’s hard to Rub in it’s straight oil I will never buy again
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,HG cleansing oil,"Fave cleansing oil at the moment. I've used several products from the line, it's a very prestigious skincare line in Korea. Does the job, also love the herbal scent of these products. I like that they have expiration dates."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Are thinking of buying it? Buy it.,"It removes makeup really well, even eye makeup without irritating my eyes. Though I do wish there were more ML in this bottle."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,not great for sensitive skin.,"I really wanted to like this product, though it is heavily scented and does not work on my sensitive skin. The oil also feels strange on my textured skin. The scent feels very overpowering. Sadly it broke me out. Will be finishing, though not returning."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Leaked,This arrived empty due to the liquid spilling all over my package. Soaked through the box. Don’t bother buying this online. Save yourself a headache.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Very rich oil,"I used this as a first cleanse and it removes all my makeup. I have very dry sensitive skin and this hasn’t irritated me. The only reason its not a 5 star is that im not a fan of the very thick texture, the bobbi brown cleansing oil is still my fav."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,amazing!,Super gentle on skin. Doesn’t break you out. Takes off all makeup! So worth the $$
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,On my third bottle - LOVE this cleansing oil.,"This is a great cleansing oil, as part of a double-cleanse routine at night! I love it. On my third bottle now. I have sensitive, reactive, normal to dry skin, and this oil is really nice for taking off basic makeup / sunscreen. No stinging, super gentle, doesn't strip the skin. A little pricey, but hey, its sulwhasoo."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Skin crack (insert drooly face),"Absolutely freaking obsessed with this stuff!! It smells soooo good, a little bit like eukalyptus, if that's your thing:) It's got this beautiful ""slip"" to it when you wash your face and super gentle for my colorado dry skin. I normally have oily skin but when I use this and hydrate the crap (like, drown my skin) out of it, I am SO much less oily. I do always double cleanse if I've had makeup on, otherwise just this."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Stan,My combination skin is prone to acne and I am replacing the DHC cleanser with the amazing Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil Makeup Remover. Most of the makeup was gone after rinsing with water and my face was clean before using the second cleanser in my routine.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Can’t Fly,"I specifically bought this to travel, and on the first flight it spills all over my travel bag. So angry. Save your money and buy a balm instead."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,"Product itself is great. Will definitely repurchase. My only issue is the packaging leaks easily. There are have been instances when I will accidentally knock the bottle over and not notice, but a good amount of product has already leaked through."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,Gentle but not the best for removing make-up. There are other cleansing oils I like better that are gentle and remove make-up a lot better. Will not be repurchasing.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,I initially liked this oil but after a couple of days it started really irritating my skin and it made me break out quite badly. I gave it to my friend who has dry mature skin and she loves it. If you have sensitive or acne prone skin I would recommend Farmacy clearly clean up oil balm. This one irritated my eyes and has a scent to it.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,use it properly and you will love it!,"This product does not require makeup pads to remove your makeup and mascara, pore a dab in your hand and rub to remove makeup, it comes off in second without any intense rubbing.  This is exactly what I love, it’s the best product I’ve used to cleanse my face. Plus I don’t need pads anymore and it’s soft on my skin and prevent wrinkles around eyes.  It’s totally worth it!!! And cleanses your pores and hydrates.  I love this product.  Use it properly people"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Biossance is better.,"Mehhhh, it was ok. I’ve tried a good amount of oil make up removers and by far Biossance is the winner. I had high hopes for this one, but the scent was unpleasant and it didn’t remove full coverage of stubborn residue like I expected it. Of course I followed with a double cleanse, but as a first step it didn’t do it for me."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,Came for the sample. Stayed for the product.,"I received this as a sample in a purchase from 2020. After the first use I fell in love with it. I am now on my second bottle. It easily breaks down my makeup and sunscreen and emulsifies beautifully with one pump. It has a slightly floral, almost rice-like fragrance, but to me is very subtle and I don't notice it much on application. I have sensitive, acne prone, combo to oily skin and it has not broken me out or irritated my skin."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,cleaning oil,"Not impressed with this one and I’ve tried many, it’s smells like Vicks vapor rub and it’s not very water salable, leaves a little residue."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,sensitive skin approved,"Very good product. When you lather it, it turns into kind of a white liquid rather than the oil that comes out which is cool. It’s very safe for sensitive skin I would say, however I wish it were a bit thicker of a consistency. More oily to get ALL of the grime of me"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,game changer,"This is worth the $$$ it takes off all my makeup up, sunscreen, waterproof mascara. I use this first and then rinse my face with water and it just melts everything away so smoothly. After I use a face cleanser to wash off the extra residue and my skin has no makeup left. It is pricey but worth the money I have used other oil cleansers but they didn’t work as well after double cleansing I would always have to go back with a cotton pad and makeup remover to take off anything that wasn’t removed. BUT with this product you do not need to do that. It does have a slight scent so if you’re not into scented skincare it may bug you. I usually don’t care to have fragrance in my skincare however this scent is aromatic. What I recommend is when you pump the oil in your hands rub it in and then take your hands and just inhale the scent for a few seconds and breathe in deeply. It sounds weird but it honestly just relaxes you. Perfect for the end of the day after all the stress you may have it just sets the mood for your skin care routine and grounds you. I’m telling you it’s a game changer! Inhale it for a few seconds and then go in and rub it on your face and let it do it’s magic."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,"Removes allllll the makeup even waterproof, is gentle on skin, no irritation. It's an A+ for me!"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,doesn’t work and highly fragranced,I am not a fan if this face wash. The perfume is so strong it lasted many washes with other face washes and wouldn’t fade until the next day. It also did a pretty good job removing my face makeup but did nothing on my mascara.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,Best oil cleanser.  If you double cleanse then you will enjoy this product.  I have dry skin and this helps me be very gentle.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,Been using this for years. This is the only make up remover that has worked for my sensitive skin.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,Did not take my makeup off and the fragrance in this was terrible!!!
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,"Hardly does the job. Can’t remove mascara well and am not talking about the waterproof kind. I had better results with Tatcha, but wanted to try something new. The search continues!"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,BUY IT!,"I love those makeup remover!! I’ve been using neutrogena makeup wipes for a while and it used to never removed all my makeup so I started looking for a new oily makeup remover that was gentle with my skin as well.. I fount this and I fell in love with it. Just about to get my second bottle. It removes all your makeup even waterproof mascara and it’s super gentle on your skin, you don’t need to rub to hard or too much. It’s perfect!! BUY IT!!! Soooo worth it"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,AMAZING,"This stuff is amazing! There are many reviews about not removing makeup completely, I had the same issue but realized if you let it sit for a couple minutes, it will remove all the makeup. It does not remove mascara which is a little disappointing. Be careful around your eyes, when my friend with super sensitive skin tried this she got little rashes around her eyes. Overall this is a great product that works well and leaves your skin clean and smooth!"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,good!,I didn’t feel this was too special but it smelled good and it took my makeup off well and I used as the first step to a double cleanse routine - but nothing life changing
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,The best!,Ordered the mini to try this out and I love it! By far the best cleansing oil I've tried. Melts away makeup easily and doesn't leave the skin feeling dried out.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,Philippines,Favorite,"This is my 2nd bottle and it last me 6mos per bottle so not bad for its price, I love this because its mild and does not irritate my very senstive eyes and ofcourse it does its job pretty good"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,Singapore,love this!,"umpteenth bottle i have purchased. light and effective. i alternate this with shu uemura's, but this is cheaper so i always go back to this. both are my holy grail cleansing oils."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,too much fragrance,Really wanted to like this but the fragrance was wayyy too strong for me.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,great cleanser,"Doesn’t break out your skin, takes off all makeup even waterproof mascara, leaves you feeling clean not oily. I love this product!"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Amazing!!,The other reviews are correct and I was NOT gifted with this. This oil is the best and my new favorite way to take off makeup. Very gentle and you do not have to use much. Rinses clean with no residue. You won’t be disappointed!
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,Thoroughly enjoyed using this cleansing oil. It definitely feels luxurious. It offers great aromatherapy and it has a lightweight texture that is easy to spread. It does a good job at breaking down my makeup and rinsing off cleanly
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,The best oil cleanser out there,"I have not found an oil cleanser anywhere near as good as this. Gets all my makeup off, rinses off my skin easily, and my dry skin feels less dry after. It’s worth the money. I usually jump around trying cleansers, but I’m loyal since using this one. I love it."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,makeup be gone,Another golden product! I switched from makeup wipes to this to take off my makeup (my friend yelled at me for the makeup wipes). It feels good rubbing off the gunk with this! I use it to double cleanse.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Holy Grail,My holy grail cleansing oil. I have normal to dry skin and my skin can feel stripped really easily. This oil takes off all of my makeup and leaves my skin feeling moisturized. Sometimes I double cleanse with it. Sometimes I don’t. Definitely always keep  this one in my rotation even though it’s pretty pricey.  A little goes a long way.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Nice Cleansing Oil,"I received the Gentle Cleansing Oil Makeup Remover as a gift from Sulwhasoo . I really enjoy oils and this one is amazing, it helps to remove all your makeup and the best part is the oil also remove regular mascara (not water proof)the oils are really helpful for my skin."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,"I love using this oil with a cotton ball and cleaning off my makeup. It also works really well with just water. I do not like to use facial wipes, so the oils are really helpful! Effectively cleans, but not that great with waterproof mascara."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,I love love loveeeee cleansing oils. I think it's important to point that out first. This brand is newish to me - I've only tried random samples previously. I used this on my eye makeup to melt it then rinse away.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Boogie on a budget,"I grew up thinking that on the oil cleanser would leave my face super gross and oily and to be honest, I never understood the purpose for them. It was not until a year ago that I first tried one out and it honestly changed my life! To use this cleanser, you first apply it to your dry face and rub in a circular motion until the make up and dirt starts dissolving and melting away from your face. Once you have applied and rubbed the oil all over your face add some water to emulsify, then rinse off and pat dry. You can follow up with a gel cleanser. This oil cleanser was effective removing impurities off of my face and my skin felt noticeably more nourished after use. I am normally not a fan of the price tag for shulwhasu products but this price tag won’t break the bank."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,"I am a fan of all that I’ve tried from the brand, and this is no exception. I can always count on the products not to give me a bad reaction. I can also count on them to always be effective. The quality is superior. This is a great first step in double cleansing without stripping any moisture from your face. Also highly recommend the cleansing water!"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Kind to the skin,"I really like this cleanser because it doesn't dry my skin.  I also really liked the fact that it doesn't make a lot of foam, it's easy to remove, and there is no smell. It is gentle on the skin and is a good makeup remover."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,"Great product, maybe a bit pricey","Great cleansing oil, I apply onto dry skin, massage gently and makeup just melts, including waterproof mascara. Then I wash everything off with water, no residue left. The pump is nice too, distributes just the perfect amount for a full face of makeup. It doesn't burn my eyes, and washes off easily. The only downside is the price, there are other makeup removing balms/oils on the market that are similar and cheaper, but this Sulwhasoo one is definitely one the best out there."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,A cleansing favorite!,"One of my favorite cleansing oils! Ive used this time and time again and this is an extremely quality product. It really does help get all the makeup, dirt and gunk off your face and doesnt leave any oily residue. However, it also doesn’t strip my skin so it feels clean, but not dry. I will definitely repurchase over and over!"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,"This cleansing oil is a new favorite! It truly melts all the makeup off, even stubborn waterproof mascara and eyeliner. It’s extremely general and hydrating.  It makes my dry skin feel clean and soft with no residue."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Love the formula,This is one of the best cleansing oils I have tried! One pump covers my entires face and upper neck and it does a great job removing makeup. What I love the most is the softness and beautiful glow my face is left after using this product. My face looks brighter and more even in regards to hyperpigmentation.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,"I am obsessed with this cleansing oil! I recently switched over from wipes and I don't think I'll ever go back. It goes on my skin way more smoothly and feels gentle on my sensitive areas, especially under eyes."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,i love,"I am amazed at how well this product removes all my makeup. I have tried it with waterproof makeup that is generally difficult to remove and with this product I remove it super easy and simple, I do not dislike its aroma but I understand that they find people with sensitivities"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,amazing cleansing experience,"I really love how it feels on the skin - very smooth and gentle. It removes makeup very effectively without being greasy or stripping at all. After rinsing off it leaves my skin clean, banlanced and soft.  One thing to point out is that it has a fairly strong scent - which I think may be from the added parfum as well as essential oils and plant extracts. Personally the fragrance is not a negative thing - but you might want to be cautious if your skin doesn't tolerant fragrances."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,The best cleansing oil!,The best cleansing oil I have ever tried! It is so gentle on my dry skin and removes even the heaviest makeup and long-wearing sun protection. It is part of the double cleansing routine as I follow up with Sulwhasoo Ginseng cleanser.  I love that it finally comes in the travel size so I can take it with me when on the go or traveling. Try it and thank me later! So so so good!
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,gentle and effective,I really liked that Sulwhasoo's mini gentle cleansing oil make up remover effectively breaks down waterproof sunscreen.

SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,"This makeup remover is very gentle and a little goes a long way. It gets rid of all makeup, including water proof mascara without feeling greasy or drying my skin! Highly recommend to everyone!"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Gentle and effective,The product smells inoffensive and went on silky smooth. The texture itself was pretty viscous and I received a sample size. I noticed a difference in my skins overall brightness and suppleness after using for a week.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,"I have a hard time with makeup removers sometimes. They’re too drying or oily, but this one is perfect. And it doesn’t sting my eyes when I’m trying to take mascara off at the end of a long day. Recommended."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Would get again,"I absolutely LOOOOVVVVED this cleanser and would definitely get it again. It didn’t strip my skin and it made it feel perfectly clean and soft. Afterwards, it gave me that natural glow and bounce to my face."
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Amazing Texture for Skin,"I am in love with this cleansing oil! It is thick enough to have that luxurious feeling, and light enough to take off all my makeup without irritating my skin.

It’s has such a nice texture that removes my makeup so well, followed up with another cleanser it leaves my skin nice and clean!

This product was not only effective but the consistency was great and the fact that it didn’t break me out is always important. Would definitely think of purchasing in the future!
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,I like this oil cleanser a lot! It removes my makeup without having to scrub or pull at my skin at all and it leaves my skin so soft after I use it without leaving a film or any residue. The only thing I could do without is the fragrance.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil - 50ml,"I enjoyed using this cleansing oil. I took my makeup off, even my mascara and didn’t sting my eyes or leave any kind of blurry film afterwards. I think if you’re looking to test out this cleansing oil to see if it’s worth the price tag, this 50 ml mini size would be worth it. This is a nice product but I don’t think it particularly stands out from all the other cleansing oils/balms I’ve used and it’s also pretty expensive"
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Good experience,Been using this for a while now and I won’t be going back to any other cleanser. Love how it takes away all my makeup without leaving my skin feeling too dry or tacky. Would recommend this to anyone wanting a new addition to their skincare routine.

SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Loved it!,This is amazing! Such a gentle and actually working cleansing oil. I tried it for the first time and I was surprised it removed even waterproof makeup without irritating my eyes. Highly recommend for everyone.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,"removes waterproof makeup, still gentle",The Gentle Cleansing Oil Makeup Remover is great for removing even waterproof makeup. This is a gentle cleanser that doesn't strip my dry skin and I can get my makeup cleaned off without scrubbing my face raw. One pump is all that I need to remove everything. I like that this comes with the type of pump that has the removeable plastic piece instead of the twist type. I save the plastic piece to put back in place for when I travel. The mini size is perfect for that as well.
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,A luxurious experience,This cleansing oil glided on so silky smooth I’m obsessed! I prefer this over my regular makeup removers because they always end up stripping all the moisture from my face and don’t even take all of my makeup off. This cleanser was super gentle and got all of my makeup off while leaving some much needed hydration back into my face from wearing makeup all day. I followed up with their first care serum and my skin has never felt better. LOVE IT!
SULWHASOO-Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Good but Strong Scent,"I needed at least 3 pumps to get rid of my makeup. The last pump was to get a really deep cleanse to remove my waterproof mascara. This got the job done, melted my makeup right off. Left my skin hydrated. Only thing I was not a fan of was the scent. Smelled like a strong essential oil but didn’t irritate my face fortunately because I have really sensitive skin"

CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),USA,Average product,"This is a good product but not outstanding. It is a very gentle, low sudsing, non-irritating facial cleanser. It did not irritate my skin, a good thing for drier, nature complexions, but I have a shade of doubt about its effectiveness."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),Canada,Hate the packaging now,"I have loved this product for years but they've changed the packaging, and the formula, and they've lost me. 
I could put up with the new formula but since they no longer give the convenience of a pump I can't be bothered.
Dumb move, Clinique."

CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),USA,Why mess with a good thing?,"I’ve been using Clinique’s 3 step system for more than a decade, and I’m so disappointed with this new formula. The original version was super gentle, but also powerful enough to remove makeup and other impurities. This new version can’t even handle what little mascara I have on after I use their eye makeup remover, which is also awful."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),USA,Ruined the packaging,I’ve used this facial soap for over 20 years. They have a cheap and Inconvenient “new look” to save them selves money.  I love this cleanser but there are so many other options out there I’m sure I’ll find something else. It’s sad though.
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),Australia,Not A Fan,"Didn't really do much for my skin, not worth the price in my opinion, used the whole bottle hoping it would do something long term but no clear difference. Wouldn't purchase again"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),USA,Silky Soak and Great Dispenser,This cleanser truly is mild. It doesn’t dry out my skin and I can use it year round. I love the newer dispenser because I could never get all of the soap out of the old pump
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),New Zealand,Value for money ,"A great cleanser. Have been using this for nearly three years now and this is the only one that suits my skin type. Have tried a few others but nothing have worked better thn this. I have a very sensitive skin and any other cleaner that I have tried gives my pimples. Hence this is my go to!! 
"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),USA,"I miss your old packaging,",I am sad about the change in packaging. I have used the 13 oz pump for the past few years and I keep it in my shower for easy access. The new packaging and smaller volume is less convenient and more wasteful.  I love this face soap but I will keep an eye out for another brand that is a larger pump. Convenience matters. A squeeze flip top is not convenient

CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),USA,current fav,"My nightly cleanser, I do switch around often but this is my current fav. I absolutely love it. I have very pale combination skin and I’ve found using a more mild cleanser to be better for my acne. Medicated cleansers are too drying for me. The face wash does get pretty sudsy but do keep in mind this is not a makeup removing cleanser. You would need to use a pre-cleanse oil or balm made for that. And then follow with this baby."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),Singapore,Good for everyday use!,i love this cleanser. it does not dry my face. it leaves a very soft and clean feeling and very gentle.  i’ve been using this twice everyday. will definitely repurchase!

CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),USA,Clinique All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),"It does a great job as a facial cleanser without any added fragrance. My skin is sensitive and reacts well to the product. I’ve purchased it multiple times, no bells or whistles just a reliable favorite. I am disappointed that they got rid of the pump a while back. I understand it is more eco-friendly but I find it harder to get product out by just squeezing the container over time."

I have sensitive eyes, and skin that reacts to chemicals and products that are too oily.  My skin and eyes love this.

It never bothers my eyes, and my skin is clear of blemishes and clean when done without being dry.  No reactivity means my skin has actually improved since using it."

CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),Canada,A soap that doesn't clean,"Absolute garbage! My entire beauty routine is Clinique and I am shocked they sell this product. This ""soap"" cannot remove foundation, eye shadow, lipstick, mascara, etc. (and I do not use waterproof products). I have to follow up with another non-Clinique product just to properly cleanse my skin.  This has caused horrible breakouts on my skin. Rather than washing away the day, it cakes your makeup back into your pores and leaves behind an oily residue. I would never recommend this product."

CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),USA,Clinique All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),This is the only facial wash that I’ve been using the last 20 years of my existence. I love this product. The only reason I’m giving it 2 stars is because the pump that came with the 6.7ml bottle started rusting.

CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),USA,terrible news packaging,You need to update the image for this product! The new packaging is terrible. Thankfully I still had the pump bottle from my last order and could transfer it but if clinique doesn't go back to the original packaging I'm not ordering again!
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),USA,Ruined a perfectly good product,"I've used this soap for over ten years, perfect for my skin type and doesn't leave any residue. I love keeping it in my shower since it has a pump and it is easy to see when I am running low. The new packaging features a tinted softer plastic and squeeze cap which I detest, it makes it so messy and impossible to use. Also whoever decided that lavender with green was a good idea should be fired- the whole thing looks cheap now. I guess I'll be on the hunt for a new facial soap..."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),USA,good gentle face soap,"I didn’t receive the same product shown in the picture, but I did get different bottle that was just updated. Now, I don’t like the new bottles.. I like the pump system. The new one you have to open the top and pour it into your hands. It’s just Kind of messy. What I do like about this product is it doesn’t taut my skin. So that’s a plus point. After every wash my face is very dry & pulling but not with this soap."

CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Oily Skin),USA,"Not for my skin, unfortunately","I used Clinique for years but eventually gave up on trying to make their cleansers work for my skin: The mild was too drying for my face, while the extra mild just pushed around dirt and impurities without actually cleansing it. I did like that these facial soaps are fragrance free, and they didn’t seem to aggravate my acne. I do think that the formulation for both versions is kind of basic — I’ve seen other facial cleansers, including some drugstore ones, at a similar price point that have a better ingredient list."

DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Malaysia,really cleanse my makeup without drying,"First step of double cleanse, this cleansing balm is so nice it is not leaving any trace of makeup but also non drying to your skin. this balm smells like cucumber. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,"This is the BEST makeup remover. I will say, eyeliner is a little tough (I usually have to go back in with a micellar water, which is fine) but, it's really nice to be able to get eye makeup off and it be easy on my eyes. 

I don't use it for my normal cleanser just when I wear makeup."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Malaysia,LOVE THIS,LOVE THE SCENT. IT SMELLS VERY NATURALL NOT TOO STRONG! Melts v easily and easy to use! This big tub lasts forever!! Im glad to found this in sephora store because its quite affordable compare to other cleansing balms out there!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Wasn’t for me,I wasn’t fond of this balm at all. My face always felt greasy after use and I have dry skin. I’ll stick with Estée Lauder nighttime cleansing balm.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Does such a great job of removing my makeup and doesn’t leave an oily feel after double cleansing
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,"Best MU Remover for Dry, Sensitive Skin by Far!","I absolutely love this product. I've been using it for a couple of years now and have extremely dry skin. 
I always massage it into my face and apply it more heavily wherever my makeup is thickest. Massaging it in really helps with breaking the makeup down and also moisturizing my skin. 
Afterward, I just wipe it off with my microfiber makeup remover towel.

IMO, this product needs to be used by being wiped off. You won't see it work as well if you try to wash it off."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Hands down the best makeup remover I’ve used! Love that it comes with a little spoon and sample of the exfoliator. Normally I’d use neutrogena makeup wipes but so happy i can use this instead! Greasensitive
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Does not rinse clean.,"Purchased this on a whim and was super disappointed. It removes makeup well, but it does not rinse clean. Even after repeatedly rinsing I felt like I had a film on my face. If you're looking for a good cleansing balm, I would strongly recommend Farmacy's line."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Must have!,Very soft and buttery like. Makes my face feel so smooth especially after I use the bamboo exfoliate! Would purchase again for sure!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Yesssss!,"This cleansing balm is amazing! I use this to remove light makeup and sunscreen. If you ware heavy makeup, this may not work as well, but it is so hydration and perfect. I love that it comes with a scooper and exfoliating beads."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Pretty good cleansing balm,"The Slaai Butter is a pretty decent cleansing balm. It does take a bit of massaging to really melt your make up though. I use this as the first step in a double cleanse but I definitely would not use this as a solo cleanser. It doesn’t feel as if it rinses clean to me. It’s fine, however, if you are double cleansing. I do really like the bamboo charcoal powder. It does not take much. Just a little sprinkle and it really does a nice job of exfoliating. I would say if you’re going to get this then use it as the first step in a double cleanse and you’ll be fine."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Works but pulls skin a lot,"I use this product to get makeup, sunscreen and motor oil off of my face every day. It does work, but it has a higher melting point than some other balms do, meaning you have to rub it in more to get it to melt which means more pulling on the skin. I've never used the exfoliator that comes with it that stuff is horrible for you."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,They changed the formula!!,"So disappointed!!! This has been my go-to makeup remover for so long, used to take off everything so quickly and thoroughly, and just got my third jar in the mail and they definitely changed something. It was impossible to remove my makeup that wasn’t even that heavy, felt like i was rubbing olive oil all over my face and just smearing everything around. I read another review that said they felt like it left a greasy film on their face and that’s a perfect description. I had to wash my face 3 times and it still felt gross. I really hope they change the formula back because it really used to be great. :("
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Meh,"This is alright. Just alright. Nothing to write home about. Melts makeup off for the most part but definitely will see some makeup after I wash my face and I don’t wear heavy makeup. Also smells kind of weird but I’m not sensitive to smells so doesn’t affect me. Wouldn’t repurchase, the belief one is better or the farmacy one will do. Even ponds cold cream would work better."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Chemical Smell not in Previous Jars :(,"Something has changed!  I opened a new jar of Slaai and the chemical smell is overwhelming.  My last jar had no smell at all.  Doesn’t seem to wash off as easily, leaving a greasy residue.  I have emailed DE to see what’s happened to the product."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,LOVE!!,This makeup remover is so gentle and a great way to remove all of ur makeup. This does not strip your skin like makeup wipes and is definitely worth the money.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Singapore,the best! ,the best. super in love with this. makeup came off easily even waterproof one. i have sensative skin and this did not cause any breakouts. double cleans and face feels clean. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Clean off the day!,A little goes a long way. It  turns into a creamy oil & cleans off every drop of makeup… including waterproof mascara. My face feels so smooth& clean after use! Very gentle & does the job!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,"Perfect for summer to remove sweat, sunscreen and dirt for being outside all day. The exfoliate beads in the morning are a perfect balance a few days a week."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,A MUST have item ! Use this to remove makeup and SPF ! Its a must for your skin care cabinet
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Malaysia,quite ok,bought it for a friend and i think it works well. quite pricey but its DE so yeah. bonus point it came with an exfoliator so you got best of both worlds :)
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Singapore,Good,I tried using it to remove my light makeup and it works wonders. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Malaysia,Love it,"The best cleansing balm. 
I’ve tried few balms, nothing compares to this. Leaves skin hydrated. I didn’t use with the bamboo thingy, as my skin is sensitive. But yeah, bomb."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,"I was super excited to finally get to using the sample I got of this from Sephora but was let down by the mediocrity of this cleansing balm. Here's what I did like: it didn't irritate my skin when it was uncomfortably dry, makeup removed very easy, I liked the addition of the exfoliation booster since you can control how much exfoliation you can use, I actually liked the scent, I felt it smelled like a very green banana.

What I didn't like: it is way too oily for me, when it's rubbed on the skin I felt that there's too much slip and I always had to double cleanse when using this to make sure it all washed off. It's not a bad cleansing balm but also isn't life changing either."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Chemical smell,"For a make up removing balm this expensive, the smell is very unpleasant.  It does do the job, I double cleanse, but you can get the same results with the Clinique balm or the Juno balm."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,love her,"I’ve restocked this maybe ten times so far, it’s the same feeling as taking your bra off - it’s just the best part of the day, double cleansing."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Skip this,"I originally had 2 stars but I changed to 1 star. I’ve gotten through about half the jar and stopped using this. It melts off your make up fine but I think it smells terrible and the exfoliating sand smells even worse. Almost like when you collect shells from the beach but leave them out to dry and it smells like gross old seafood. It doesn’t leave me feeling like my face is clean and cleansed I feel clogged and oily. I double cleanse anyway but after putting this on I feel like I have to wash my face 4 more times to just get it off. I’ve broken out all over my face from using this and now I’m doing damage control on all my break outs. I usually don’t break out but I have break outs on every portion of my face. The only reason I would use this is if I had stubborn eye make up but even then I think I just want to completely throw the jar out. The only thing it does well is melt your make up but it doesn’t clean your face and leaves residue, which makes me feel like my make up is probably still on my face. I wouldn’t recommend this and I definitely will never buy this again."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Doesn't totally remove makeup,"This doesn't remove everything from your face.  Residue makeup still there.  Works well as a first step, but had to follow up with a regular cleanser."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Better cleansing balms out there.,Found this required quite a bit of effort to emulsify and fully remove makeup. Has an earthy scent that might not be for everyone. Leaves skin moisturized but with a feeling that there’s product left on the skin. A plus that does not appear to contain plastics.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,It works!,Amazing! This product works. It removes 100% of my makeup without leaving residue or causing breakouts. I’m a fan!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,the best ever,"truly the best cleansing balm i’ve ever used, i’ve tried a lot and phew i always go back to this one. it’s the only one that doesn’t leave a film on my face with clean ingredients. i’m acne prone, went through accutane, tret, everything and this is the only one that doesn’t break me out. love it so much plus it lasts awhile❤️❤️❤️"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,You get what you pay for!,"I've tried using less expensive micellar waters, cleansing oils, and balms. This is worth the money. A little bit goes a long way. It is gentle on my sensitive skin (I don't use the Bamboo Booster), and it literally melts off my makeup and sunscreen. Plus, it just feels luxurious at the end of a long day."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,so greasy,I usually use the farmacy version of this product but decided to switch it up. big (expensive) mistake. its more greasy and less cleansing. it never full gets ride of my make up and I'm pretty minimal with what I put on. its hard to clean off your skin as well.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Best makeup remover! Perfect for first step in a double cleanse.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Really liked it!,"I've had problems with other make-up removers since my mascara is hard to take off. It was so tiring to scrub my eyes of with micellar water so I looked for a melting butter. I had read some reviews on this product that claimed it broke them out and to not buy... I risked it and I fell in love with this product! I don't have extremely problematic skin but it is pretty sensitive and this product is just so soothing and soft, it really worked well for me! It isn't super oily just very creamy and doesn't smell like anything to me! I've been using it for like half a year and I still have so much left! I take it on trip and everything and is just perfect for me.

I would highly recommend :)))"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,heavy with a bad smell,"I will say this works very well to remove makeup. However I was relieved when I finished it and moved on to Farmacy’s makeup remover. This drunk elephant stuff smells so bad, especially as it gets older. It’s also just really heavy compared to the farmacy balm. I have dry sensitive skin and either is good for my skin."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Love this product!!!,"I love this product! I have been using makeup wipes forever and found them to be very drying, and I heard that makeup remover balms are better for your skin so I decided to try this. I have found a little amount goes a long way, and this product seems to just melt all of my makeup off. It leaves my skin feeling more hydrated than if I had used a makeup wipe. I've not experienced any breakouts or eye irritation/sensitivity due to this product. I have found this product works best if you warm it up between your fingers before applying it. My only complaint would be that because it is an oil-based balm it doesn't mix well with water, so the only way I've found to effectively remove the makeup is by using a washrag. However, I've never noticed any staining on my rags after being washed."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,"Good cleansing Balm, second purchase",Second time I purchase this. Reminds me of Augustinus Bader cleansing balm but less pricey.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,"I am on my third jar of this and I absolutely love it. it melts away all my makeup easily, including the mascara and doesn't leave my skin feeling all dry."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Keep your old cap,"Yes, the package change is annoying, but I think they changed the formula as well and to me the formula is better than before, it is more easy to spread out on your hand and easier to activate with water. My guess is they might have to take out the magnet to keep the cost the same. I do double clean, I use the Chanel Foam face cleanser afterwards and my skin always feels great！I have been using this since 2020."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,WHY,"WHY mess with this once-perfect product?! I've purchased this so many times and loved it. This time though, the spoon is no longer magnetic...okay not a big deal. But the product is so much more solid/hard to scrape out, even more difficult to get on skin, and doesn't come off as cleanly as before. So, so sad."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,LOVE! Use as step 1 when double cleansing!,"I love this product. Note, I DO double cleanse, but I do not use it as my main cleanser. I use this as my very first step, to take my makeup off. I warm it up in my hands and rub it gently all over my face to release and melt all the makeup. It’s very gentle and even helps get waterproof mascara off. Definitely have to keep my eyes closed though. I only use about a dime size amount, and it goes a long way. It makes my face feel so nice and smooth after. I then use a real cleanser AFTERWARDS. I AM SO UPSET THEY TRADED THE MAGNETIC SPOON ATTACHMENT FOR THE CLIP IN ONE THOUGH!!!!! THE CLIP IN ONE IS SO INCONVENIENT WHEN IM TRYING TO DO THIS IN THE SHOWER WITH ONE HAND!!!!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Ehhh....,"So, I'm not sure if I'm not using it right or what? I followed the instructions only to be left constantly wiping this product off my face. ""Warm water activates it""? Hardly, it's oil and water- they don't mix and this product is so hard to get off. I end up washing my face twice- sometimes 3 times to get all of this waxy product off. It's disappointing due to the price of the product. It does work well removing most make-up. However, it's then a process to remove this product from your face."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Love this cleanser,I absolutely love this cleanser. Purchased it multiple times. Not a big fan of bamboo exfoliant though.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,J’adore!,"J’ai acheté ce nettoyant pour ma fille et moi. De mon côté, j’aime tout de ce produit, allant de la spatule aimantée sur le couvercle au fini que le produit laissé sur ma peau. Le maquillage s’enlève à merveille, facilement. J’ai l’impression que ma peau reste douce après utilisation.
Ma fille n’a pas aimé du tout ce démaquillant car elle a fait des boutons tout de suite après son utilisation."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Other better options out there,Purchased this because I wanted something that was different than an oil. The concept of including an attached spatula is great but the product itself is not. It’s very waxy and not the easiest to wash off. I spend so much time trying to wash this off even after wetting my hands and going back in to massage it into my skin again and again. My skin doesn’t feel that much cleaner either after incorporating this before my regular face wash
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,meh,"This cleanser isn't the worst. Not great tho. Some days it comes off pretty easily, but most days it takes soooo much effort to rinse it off. sometimes I also feel like it might be leaving a small film on my face, which I don't mind a lot in the winter. ultimately, I would say this isn't worth the money"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,can’t live without it,"I love everything about this product. the texture and little scoop is fun to use, I love the smell, a little fruity, but most importantly it removed ALL my makeup, no matter what I have, I feel so clean after. one of the best DE product for sure!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,makes me feel like I have a film on my face,This product does a good job removing makeup but leaves a very weird film on even after cleansing after putting it on. My face doesn’t feel clean after. I have a lot left since it’s a huge jar but I plan on only using it for my eyes. I don’t love the smell but it’s fine since I use it before I go to bed. I do like the little spatula that comes with it though.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,Only product I use to take off makeup,"I love this! I hate the process of taking off makeup, and anything that requires a cotton pad requires 3-5 cotton pads to get all the makeup off. This is AMAZING. Some of the reviews I have read make me feel as though people don’t quite know how to use it properly. It’s not supposed to act as a cleanser, thus you have to wash your face after you’ve given your face a good rub with this product. Also, you scoop some into your finger tips and rub together until it creates a smoother consistency. This is the absolute only product that takes off ALL of my makeup. I don’t use the exfoliant at all, so I only gave this 4 stars as I feel wasteful repurchasing this product and it doesn’t give an option to not include the exfoliant."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Clumpy,This product is a wonderful makeup remover. It is gentle on the eyes. I have been purchasing it with dedication but the last tub was not creamy enough. Product was not melting as usual
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,"I received this as part of a DE value set and I finally got around to using it after running out of my other cleansing balm. First of the smell isn't my favourite, but I know with clean skin care there isn't much you can do about that. In terms of its texture and how it felt on my skin it reminded me a lot of a glue stick and I had a hard time spreading it around my face compared to other balms I've tried. It did feel like it cleaned my face and got a majority of the day's gunk off of my face. Not sure how well it takes off make up since I only use it to help take off sunscreen."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Meh.,"The packaging is great and I love how they give you a little spatula to keep the product clean for each future use. Also. The bamboo booster was a really nice addition and I’ve been adding it to my other jelly and cream cleansers when I feel like I need an extra exfoliant boost. Who do we write to, to have this sold separately! Lol 

However, those are the best praises I can give for this product. 

I had really high hopes for this cleansing balm since I’ve loved my other DA products I’ve tried. Unfortunately, for me, this product just wasn’t the biz. When I tried to use it. I felt like the product didn’t remove my makeup properly. It kind of just lifted it and captured it inside the balm and smeared it all over my face. When I would go to rinse the product off,  it would just stick to my skin, leaving me to have to use a towel to wipe the makeup sludgy mess from my face. 

I’ve heard other people really enjoy this product. Unfortunately for me. I won’t be buying again."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Malaysia,Goodness in a container! ,"Delicate scent, with skin friendly ingredients, this balm cleanses skin adequately without leaving a dried out sensation. A little bit costly,but appreciate that at least it comes in a large volume enough to last for some time. I would not recommend other products of DE,but this one is an exception!!!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,burns eyes and very oily,"I absolutely love the Farmacy cleanser but decided to try this one this time. First, it is very oily and feels like it takes forever to get off my skin when I’m washing it off. Second, it burns my eyes so bad every time I use it. Last, it doesn’t remove my eye makeup as easily as the farmacy brand. While it is more expensive than the farmacy brand the thing I do like about it is that you really need very little so the container will last a lot longer and that’s why I am giving it 3 stars. I really wanted to like it but my biggest complaint is that it burns my eyes and therefore, I will likely not repurchase in the future."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Will forever use,"Obsessed! I have dry and sensitive skin and was desperate to find a makeup remover that wasn't abrasive. This is the stuff. I don't use the exfoliant that often, but I use the butter every night and my skin is so soft and youthful looking!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Effective and Safe for Sensitive Skin,"I love this melting cleanser.  I use it to take off my makeup at the end of the day.  My skin is super sensitive and generally any amount of oil/butter makes me break out, even if it’s just for a minute or two.  But this doesn’t make me break out at all.  Also super effective in taking off my makeup!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,"Good, but there are better","This was my go-to cleanser for a while, but I found that it was harsh on my eyes. I would wake up with crusty eyes after cleansing at night. I’ve since switched to Farmacy’s Green Clean and am much happier."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Not purchasing again,I didn't love this product. This is the third cleansing balm that I've used and about to be done with the entire thing and will not be purchasing again. I does noticeably seem to remove black/white heads once it lathers but not as well as the heimish all cleansing balm. It also leaves my face feeling slightly dry. Something that heimish does not do. I recommend heimish over this product!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,"I love it! Removes all my make up, my skin looks and feels healthier"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,just lather grape seed oil,This balm does not emulsify completely and leaves a firm of grease after wash. I rather apply cheap grape seed oil for double cleansing.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Singapore,clean skin,This is fantastic stuff. The little magnetic spatula is a little extra that make it feels like a higher end product. Cleans every bit of makeup like magic and is super gentle. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,This product really didn’t blow me away. I definitely think there are better cleansing balms out there and that this one is not worth the price point.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Scoop Changed,"I love the product I've had mine for a little over a year, not a big deal but it is annoying that they changed the packaging. I am going to miss the magnet scoop it is way easier when you have slippery hands with product."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Obsessed with this product - works so well and doesn’t leave a gross residue like some others I’ve tried! Also doesn’t have a scent which I love.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,"Changed formula? I’ve been buying this for a long time now and the most recent one I got had different packaging. I’m not a huge fan and liked the magnetic spoon a lot more. I also feel like the formula has changed. This never use to make me break out but since I started using the one I just bought I’ve been getting small breakouts on my cheeks. Nothing else has changed in my routine, hormones or what I’m eating."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,it was ok,"I found that this had a weird smell that I didn’t enjoy, it was really thick and required being removed with a cloth."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,okay,"This removes makeup, but it doesn’t completely rinse. I feel a film left on my skin after rinsing, which I’m not a fan of. Other popular brands are easier to work in, and rinse completely."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,"Love this as my first cleanser on days where I wear a lot of makeup. I'm in the hair industry so I always have a full face when at work, and I found massaging a small amount on dry skin, then using a little water removes a big part of my makeup, and I can follow up with the jelly cleanser to finish the job. Also, I love the little exfoliator product that comes with it, I usually do that every other day."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,Really melts makeup,I love this for removing my makeup before cleansing my skin. It lasts a long time and I’ve repurchased it a second time. I also recommended it to my sister.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Malaysia,Great product,"I like that the spatula is magnetic and goes easily on top of the lid, as I tend to lose them often. I scoop some up with the spatula, rub over dry skin and wipe off with a facial cloth that has been soaked in warm/hot water. Feels like a quick daily facial. It works really well with the included exfoliating powder. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,"Horrible smell , and it doesn’t that efficiently , i know is clean and all that but  i found the clinique one better"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Not for Acne prone skin.,"Some of the bad reviews on this product are very misleading. This is not a cleanser it is a cleansing balm and it’s made to remove makeup. You then follow up with a cleanser to cleanse the oil off to prevent acne. This will cause clogged pores if you do not double cleanse. I would recommend this product to someone with very resilient, dry skin who is not acne prone. It is a very thick cleansing balm and even when I double cleanse, it does clog my pores. Do not buy this if you have oily, acne prone skin. I would recommend this for dry skin but for oily skin I would recommend the Oat Cleansing Balm from the Inkey List."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,"If acne-prone, follow this up with second cleanse!","I have been using all of the DE products. For days where I’m not wearing makeup or for morning cleanses, I use the DE jelly cleanser and that one is perfect for acne/sensitive skin. However, on days where I am wearing makeup, I use this Slaai makeup-melting butter as a first step, followed by the DE toner to make sure all makeup is off and then the DE jelly cleanser. Slaai almost completely takes off makeup which is great and I love that this is unscented. The only downsides to this product are that you may need to rinse your eyes again after washing off to make sure it doesn’t seep into your eyes and cause slight blurriness (never causes eye stinging) and also this seems to be too oily for acne-prone skin to not follow with a second cleanse. When using alone, I seem to get a few small whiteheads from this. All in all, I will keep using for taking off makeup."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Such a phenominal product. Takes off even the most stubborn makeup with ease
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,"I gave this a try after finishing my Pharmacy, and this is so bad. It melts the makeup but leaves a thick film on the face and hands. So you get your hands full of foundation and it's so greasy so hard to wash off! Never buying again, I'll be dumping the entire thing."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Totally bomb!!!,"I am not usually a big reviewer of things, but I just bought this the other day, as I had been reading all of these things about make up removing butters and balms. I had the opportunity to use it tonight and it absolutely removed every amount of makeup on my face. Every. Trace. Of. Makeup. And my skin felt smooth and not dried out after. Seriously a game changer for me."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,"This is my favorite skincare product to use after a long day with makeup on. It feels so smooth and luxurious on your skin. It’s gentle on my sensitive skin and around my eyes to remove mascara. Once I use this to remove the top layer of makeup, I use face wash to remove the rest, and take off the “waxy” feeling. I love that it lasts long, as well! The bamboo exfoliator that comes with is also very gentle on skin."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,weird smell & greasy residue,"Among all the makeup remover that I have used, this is the worst balm type product. It does remove the makeup quickly, but it smells really weird and leaves a layer of greasy and waxy residue on the face even with a warm washcloth."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Really melts,This does a great job at easily removing my make up. It melts as you rub it into your skin. After getting it wet it just wipes off! I don’t really care for the smell of it though.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Worked Well,This was the first makeup remover balm I’d ever tried and it worked quite well. It’s similar to other balms and helps remove waterproof sunscreen and makeup.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,I use this every night. It removes all my makeup. I use cotton facial pads to wipe it off my face and my never feels dry in the morning. I don’t use any other face wash or even a toner. Love that it removes make up and cleanses at the same time. This is the best my skin has ever been.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Hard to melt. Leaves a film.,"Compared to all the makeup balms I’ve used in the past, this one is my least favourite one. I found the product hard to melt on your hand — making it difficult to spread the product on your face. Once you get it on there and melt off the makeup, it leaves this strange film texture that I’m not a fan of. It becomes a little difficult to wash off (compared to other makeup balms I’ve used). I barely used the exfoliant as well.

Overall, it does its job. However, it’s not my favourite makeup balm by far."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Pass. Doesn't wash clean.,"It has a thick texture that's a little hard to spread but it does melt off all makeup and sunscreen. However, it doesn't wash away clean, it will leave behind a residue. You need to use a washcloth to properly this product, which I prefer not to do since I don't need the physical exfoliation. There are so many better products for this price that I'd skip this product (clinique take the day off balm, good molecules cleansing balm is excellent etc.) And the exfoliating booster included seems like something that would just give you micro-abrasions, like an apricot scrub. Pass all around."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,definite no!,"I purchased this product for myself at Christmas this year, it is now September about 7 months later. Every morning I open up my cleanser container and it is FILLED with mold!! I've tried wiping it clean, scraping off the top layer, containing it in my fridge/freezer and nothing is working. I'm disgusted! do not buy this product!!!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,New Formula???,"Am I the only one who didn’t realize they changed the formula? Was absolutely In LOVE with the old one, but this new one made me breakout. Will be returning"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Better options out there...,"Tried it on a whim, as it was the only makeup remover balm available when I went in store. For reference, I usually go for the Farmacy Green Clean. I found this product difficult to remove, left a greasy/waxy feeling to my skin (not hydrating at all). Thankfully I double cleanse anyway, so my actual cleanser is able to remove the remnants/feeling of this product. I will still continue to use this product because it still does an okay job at removing my makeup."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Amazing for sensitive skin! This one is the winner,I am obsessed with this cleanser. I was in Paris and my skin was feeling icky and dry. I went out on a whim and got this with the moisturizer pack. Let me tell you…this leaves my skin so hydrated. I have hyperpigmentation and sometimes acne this is just so wonderful. For the other reviewers who are using this as a makeup remover for heavy makeup. I would suggest cleaning with a wipe and then using this it works wonders! So happy I found this product
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Absolutely love this! This melts away makeup right away and smells so good! I also love the packaging and the bamboo exfoliator!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,"DRUNK ELEPHANT slaai makeup-melting butter cleanser
i use as my step 1 of a double/triple cleanse to remove makeup—MAC studio radiance face and body waterproof base which is sheer but it has staying power. after rinsing DE slaai, i use bioderma  sensibo H2O soaked cotton rounds to remove any leftover mascara and residue. I follow with cetaphil  and a clean washcloth. i tone with an alcohol-free stridex salicylic pad. i have also tried Banilla clean it zero sensitive and Farmacy cleansing balms. i prefer DE slaai bc of the better makeup removal. 1 star off bc does not rinse off as effortlessly as clean it zero. 
DE slaai is also my 1st step to clean Sephora Pro synthetic makeup brushes. i start w DE slaai and then Bioderma sensibo H2O to remove makeup. then i use Dawn dish detergent to clean followed by quick dip in 70% isopropyl alcohol/rubbing alcohol to disinfect."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,Hard to rinse and smells bad (waxy),"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This was my first cleansing balm so I’m not sure if they are all hard to rinse. I understand you’re supposed to double cleanse but this is just bad. The product is a hard wax that you have to “dig” or break up with your nail/spoon. It melts and you put it on your face. It smells so waxy and the product is a unhealthy yellow colour. After melting into my face, it’s hard to rinse and I have to use two cleansers to remove it. Overall weird and an unpleasant experience. I got this as a free sample."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,This product works SO well and I’ve repurchased many times. Do I love the smell? No. Do I like the new packaging? NO. Does it work? Absolutely yes. It leaves my skin feeling absolutely amazing and takes off makeup flawlessly. Bring back the magnetic packaging PLEASE.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,Expensive and ineffectual,This product did not work for me at all. It was very difficult to rinse off. It didn't remove the makeup. I usually do a double cleanse but I ended up having to wash my face three times in order for the makeup to be completely removed.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,not worth it,"Does not remove eye makeup and leaves face greasy, I have to use a makeup remover and wash my face with cleanser after I use this product so it’s useless. Doesn’t remove water proof mascara, you have to rub so much and still doesn’t come off. Pharmacy green clean is way better."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Very unhappy with the new packaging - bring back the magnetic top. Love the cleanser. Very loyal but annoyed user.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Drunk Elephant Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,"My favorite cleansing balm, and I’ve tried them all! A little goes a long way. This balm removes all my makeup and sunscreen without stripping my face. It easily washes away with some warm water. I like using the provided physical exfoliant once a month."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,Canada,ick!,"I never return anything to Sephora, but I returned this because I could not stand the way this felt on my face. I also ADORE Drunk Elephant products, so this was a major disappointment for me"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,you can’t beat it!,I really enjoy this product. Did my research and the little bonus exfoliant made this the one for me. It gets the makeup off while smelling good. It makes me want to use this product. I haven’t seen any breakouts purely from using this product either which is good. It also gives you a good amount.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Slaai™ Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser,USA,Awuful smell,Did I get a bad product? Mine has an awful smell of old grease or rancid oil. It felt greasier on the skin then Green clean and wasn’t as easy to spread out on the face. It washed away ok but I get a cleaner feel after green clean. But the smell was the worst.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Brightening Dual Exfoliator,Singapore,love much ,great effective product. what's there not to love! repeat purchase. have recommended to friends! pretty value for money. delivery from Sephora was pretty speedy too. love being a gold member. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Brightening Dual Exfoliator,Singapore,Nice smell and clear skin,"Bought this to try, scrub contains so tiny salt bits it feels really good, face feels brighter after wash, smell is a little fruity i think? Happy with purchase will buy again."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Brightening Dual Exfoliator,USA,So Impressed!,"I'm so impressed with the exfoliation and cleansing of this scrub! It's as good as the Dr Brandt Microdermabrasion at a fraction of the price! I hope they never do away with it, it's in my weekly routine, thanks Sephora!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Brightening Dual Exfoliator,Australia,Deep Cleans,I love most of the Sephora branded stuff because it’s always amazing quality and priced well. This is one of my favourite exfoliants I’ve ever used. You can feel it doing a deep clean as you’re using it and your skin looks and feels amazing. After using it for 2 weeks my skin noticeably looked fresher and cleaner. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Brightening Dual Exfoliator,Canada,Sephora Collection Brightening Dual Exfoliator,"I have very dry, flaky skin that is also incredibly sensitive. Giving this product 4 stars because I think it would be awesome for most people, but given how sensitive my skin is, my face was red and unhappy all day after trying. Wishing it had of been better for me but I think it’s a great alternative to expensive products for others!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Brightening Dual Exfoliator,USA,Sephora Collection Brightening Dual Exfoliator,Great product especially for the price! Mature skin approved!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Brightening Dual Exfoliator,Malaysia,affordable and plenty of benefit,Been using this product for 1 month notice my skin brighter and smoother. Suitable for sensitive skin. The texture was supple to my skin. Recommend to friends and family 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Brightening Dual Exfoliator,Singapore,love it,I hope scrubbing it good for my face. Its really fine and feels really nice when scrubbing. I have sensitive face but it does not irritate my skin. Its a nice exfoliater and i will definitely repurchase this. Frangrance free which is preferred 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Brightening Dual Exfoliator,USA,great for the price,"Great for the price I guess. Got a sample to use in the shower as a secondary scrub/wash after my Kate Somerville Acne face wash. I hated the Fresh Strawberry scrub & my OG First Aid Beauty scrub was discontinued so I was looking for a happy medium between the two. 

It’s effective but you really have to rinse to get the exfoliating beads off (they get everywhere..including in my hair). I don’t mind so much b/c I’m using it in the shower but if this was over the sink it would get messy. 

Ended up buying a full size after the sample ran out & it is hard to get out of the tube since it’s so thick. But for the price + effectiveness & such I’ll deal with it."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Brightening Dual Exfoliator,Canada,100%,"I love this exfoliate - I have / had flaky skin on my face and this helps a lot.
I’ve never had a skincare routine since it would burn my skin no matter how many Products I’ve tried .
Now this was gonna be the last try finding a skincare product and I’ve now found it. It’s perfect."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Brightening Dual Exfoliator,USA,Sephora Collection Brightening Dual Exfoliator,"Exfoliating wise, yes! Bomb! But I can rinse my face 3 times and still have tiny little exfoliating beads on my face.. a bit annoying but still very good product!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Brightening Dual Exfoliator,USA,OMG !!! BEST EXFOLIATING CLEANSER EVER!,"Ok not joking here. I have weirdo combo skin that can’t decide if it wants to break out from oil like A middle ugh aged woman with acne, get old and shrivel like a raisin, or do both and break out into hormonal stress acne while aging from sun damage as a teen. So, exfoliators are a MUST in my beauty regimen. Now at first I was totally in love with fresh strawberry sugar scrub. And while until I bought this baby it was my favorite ever, the Sephora collection version blows every other product out of the water. The exfoliant is very tiny fine but gritty smoothing Sand textured particles. I can only compare it to that perfect grit nail file that shapes, smooths and buffs all in one. Plus it still suds like a normal cleanser so it rinses easily. 5 star product at an awesome price my new exfoliation product for life!!!!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Brightening Dual Exfoliator,USA,pretty good,This product was more effective than i thought. I really like an exfoliating skin care product and the price point was good so i thought i would try it.  It made my skin feel really good although not as glowy as others once i rinsed off. I use it once a week as it is a little abrasive so a little goes a long way
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Brightening Dual Exfoliator,Canada,Sephora Collection Brightening Dual Exfoliator,"I had such high hopes but I hated this. The enzymes felt like harsh sugar/ salt across my face and got even more abrasive once I tried to rinse it off. Honestly reminds me of the St Ives Apricot Scrub. Wouldn’t recommend, way too harsh for the face."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Brightening Dual Exfoliator,Canada,Sephora Collection Brightening Dual Exfoliator,"Love this product, its gentle on the skin and smell nothing"
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,"Great cleanser, still super gentle but has little microbeads?"
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Singapore,it really cleans my skin,"i use this face wash for years! it really cleans my skin and it smells good , my face doesn’t feel weird after I use it , i always use with Ford face washing machine ! "
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The cleansing foam is quiet foamy and soft with touch.  After rinse, my face felt refreshed, soft, and hydrated. Great for summer with oily face.  Also smells nice. It is on the pricy end."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Beautifully light yet deep cleaning,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Light and non drying. Definitely a great cleanser. A beautiful all around product and I think I’ll define continuing to keep this one around.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This cleanser was very nice to use. It doesn’t make a lot of lather but it did do a great job cleaning my face. It didn’t make my skin feel tight or dry, just clean. It is on the expensive side but it does do a beautiful job."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really liked the cleansing foam. It didn't dry my skin out like some products do. And I felt like it cleaned throughly. 
I recieved this product complementary to do a review on from influenster"
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) One of the better cleansers I've tried. Leaves skin feeling clean but not too dry. A better version of the Shiseido line of foaming cleansers. Smells light, foams well, everything you want from a high end cleanser."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) One of the few clarifying cleanser I've used that is non-stripping after I rinse it off my face. It went on smooth and left my skin feeling fresh. I would recommend this product if it fits in to your budget. It's a product that I likely won't repurchase due to the price point. 

I used this cleanser for 3 straight days while on vacation. It went on smooth and left my skin feeling clean and moisturized. Some cleansers leave my face feeling dry right after rinsing.  The one con is the price point. I would likely stick to my usual cleanser."

I would likely stick to my usual cleanser.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Good,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This clarifying cleansing foam leaves your skin feeling healthy and radiant. I got this as a sample and was only able to use it twice but both times my skin felt clean and refreshed.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,It cleans.,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Gentle cleanser which leaves a nice scent after. A little goes a long way but at that price point I rather a cheaper cleanser. My skin does feel hydrated after compared to feeling dried out by other cleansers.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It lathers nicely and doesn’t strip my dry skin. It smells good and is not overly perfumed. However, I didn’t find anything special about it."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Better than expected,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This cleansing foam worked better than expected. It left my skin soft and hydrated unlike other cleansers. There is a subtle perfume left on the skin. I am quite happy with the results
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Effective and clean feeling,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I use this on light makeup days because I need something stronger for the typical amount of product I wear. But this feels very gentle on the skin and gives the “clean” feeling. I appreciate that this product keeps the oil at bay and I don’t have to worry about feeling like I’m walking around with residue that I can’t remove.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This cleansing foam is surprisingly good which can make a lot of foam. And it cleans really well. However, for this price, there are many similar or better options out there. So this price point makes me hesitate from buying again."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Foams well,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The cleanser foams up well and a little goes a long way. It leaves your skin soft and clean after wash and the product smells good. It has a creamy texture once rubbed with water and gets the impurities out of my skin and remove my makeup. It's just the whole bottle is pricey...
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,A little goes a long way.,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) A little bit of this cleanser goes a long way, good thing too because it’s quite expensive for a cleanser. There is very little scent, I actually would say no scent but my teen says she can smell it. 
It is a smooth texture and definitely cleans away what little makeup I wear, but doesn’t feel like it strips the skin of anything. If this cleanser wasn’t so expensive I would definitely buy it for myself."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,A must have!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) A wonderful gentle cleanser. My skin is very sensitive and this had a luxurious light weight feel that also did the job great. My skin was glowing after cleansing!
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Good foaming cleanser,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Cleans well and does a good job with removing oil/anything you don't like on your face - you feel squeaky clean and refreshed after use.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Great product, and works well. Cleans well, I use for both morning and night."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really loved the way this felt on my skin and the way my skin felt after. I would recommend this and it’s worth the price.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Recommend for oily/combo skin!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Love the texture and how my skin feels after washing, very light scent. I would recommend for Oily/combo skin. Giving it 4 star cause of the price."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Foamy but drying,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product as a free sample from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. 
This is a very concentrated cleanser, so you really do not need a lot to feel clean. It’s very foamy and lightly scented. Although, my skin feels very dry after rinsing and I have combination skin. It does give a nice glow after washing but I do not think it’s for me as I find it very drying."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Great cleanser!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I got a small sample of this cleansing foam in a mini square packet. At first I thought I wouldn't be able to get multiple washes to really test it, however, a small amount, probably a smear of my fingerprint size was enough to foam up and cleanse my entire face. The smell is not overwhelming, so if scented is not your thing, you'll like this product. My face felt oil free afterwards but for someone who has dry skin, I felt like it might have been too much. I am not someone who normally wears makeup, so it left my face feeling slightly tight and uncomfortable as I have dry skin."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Received sample product from #Influenster. Consistency was buttery and my face did feel clean but I feel it’s too expensive when I can get the same results from other cleansers that are cheaper.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Rich & foaming cleanser. A little goes a long way.,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I was able to try this cleanser for almost a week even with two small sample packets, a little goes a long way. It foams up nicely & is lightly scented. It made my skin feel thoroughly cleansed although a tiny bit tight after patting dry. I have very oily skin & have been using the cle de peau beautè line for a week exclusively. Overall I have noticed an improvement with dullness & a nice glow."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Not my favorite,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received a sample or the product and there was barley any product. I even thought it was actually empty at first. The product was thick and I used it on my face brush.  I didn't love the smell.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Pricey,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Pricey and pretty much the same as most cleansers.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Great product!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This cleansing foam is buttery soft and lathers beautifully on the skin. I usually break out after trying any new product but this one just magically suited my skin. I personally love the scent but to some it might be a bit much. The product itself is very light and does a very good job taking off dust, oil and grime from my face. Highly recommend it."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I recieved this as a sample. The scent if very light and it foamed okay but not great. It left my skin feeling clean but the price point was way too high for me to purchase.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Nice product,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This cleansing foam is nicely scented and has a creamy texture. It made my skin feel soft and refreshing.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Rich and creamy cleanser,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a very rich cleanser. It cleansed my face while also leaving it feeling moisturized. I wasn’t a fan of the scent though.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a beautiful cleanser has a nice creamy texture, the price point is a little bit high for me to repurchase."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Great cleanser,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a great cleansing foam with an amazing smell.  Nice lather and makes my skin feel clean afterwards without feeling dry.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I loved the way this cleanser felt on my face.  It is creamy and silky and lathers beautifully.  It felt like it did a great job of getting all the sunscreen and dirt off my face while still leaving my face feeling soft and hydrated (I have fairly dry skin).  I like the smell of it, although there is quite a bit of fragrance so it might no be appropriate for people with sensitivities.  I'm not sure I'd spend this on a cleanser, but if you have the money, it's an effective and enjoyable experience."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received a small sample of this to try. The texture of the cleanser is creamy enough and makes my skin feel much cleaner. As mentioned in the description, it is meant for those with more oily skin so I feel if your skin is more dry, this might not be the best product for you. I didn't need to use a lot (just a small quarter-size on the palm)  for it to be effective."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love how well this cleanser lathers, it makes me feel like it’s really getting all the impurities out. It left my face soft and didn’t make it feel dry"
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Clean and fresh,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The consistency is quite creamy and works up in to a good amount of lather. The skin feel well cleansed and soft after using it, but it doesn’t feel super dry. For reference I have extremely oily skin and this suited me well and did not break me out. #TheEmpowerOfThree #complimentary @Influenster"
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Overall a nice product,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) For the price of this product I wouldn’t say it was astronomically better than lesser priced cleansers I’ve tried. Having said that tho, it did leave my skin feeling clean and tight, which is what I like after using a cleansing foam. It was slightly abrasive at first, it seems to have tiny scrubby bits but they dissipated quickly. Overall it was a nice product. The scent was similar to baby powder in my opinion, so a light scent."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,SO GOOD!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I am a big fan of this cleaning foam. It has such an amazing smell and texture. It is so refreshing and clarifying!
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received a small sample to try of this and my skin was not a fan. It does foam up nicely but felt slightly stripping and dried out my skin. The second time I tried it, I used it as a second cleanse to see if it felt better after an oil but it was hard to tell if it did much else and it still felt too drying for me. It does foam up nicely and smelled okay. I would probably pass on this one unless you are very oily though, especially for that price."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Felt good,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received a small sample to test from Influenster and I liked how creamy it was and how nice and soft my skin felt after. I had a few white heads coming up and they cleared up between the cleanser and serum.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this as a free sample. It was too small to really get a good feel for long term results, however it did feel nice and lather well. If you’re into luxury skincare I recommend this."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Very nice lather,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The consistency of this was really nice and creamy. The smallest amount would create a significant lather and it felt nice going on. My skin felt great afterwards but the sample was too small to really tell how much good it would do after using it more than twice.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Clean so well but keep hydration,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I use this cleanser in the morning. It feels greats and helps me to remove the dead skin and dirty my face accumulated at night. My skin feels very soft after using it. Very good product. Will buy it again.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Recommended,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Rich and smoothing texture, I love how it leaves my skin soft and moisturize after every wash! My skin feels clean and refreshing!!! Recommended and I would definitely try out other products as well!!!"
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I got this cle de peau face wash from Influster,
Very nice, refreshing glowing on your face and it wont dry my face."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Clarifying Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) A very gentle cleanser that cleans but will not strip your skin. My skin doesn’t feel tight or rough after using this cleanser, and I am pleasantly surprised! It removes all the dirt after my oil cleanse so it does its job! Not the cheapest cleanser on the market but it makes me feel so fancy ;) I enjoyed using this!"
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Deep cleansing cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received a sample of this cleanser from influenster. This cleanser is high in quality. It’s gentle on my skin, foams well, only a small amount needed. It’s very deep cleaning and my skin feels great after. I would recommend."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Amazing cleanser for combo skin,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a gentle and effective cleanser. Only a small amount is needed to produce a rich, luxurious lather. My skin was left feeling thoroughly cleansed and refreshed. This a wonderful cleanser for combo skin: my nose was degreased while my cheeks weren’t left dried out or tight."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Gentle cleanser great for sensitive skin!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a gentle and effective cleanser. I have sensitive skin that’s prone to redness. This cleanser left my skin clean without that overly tight/stripped feeling and it also helped calm my redness.
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Rich foaming cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) A tiny dab creates a rich foam that’s not drying. There are microsand for texture, I wouldn’t say it’s strong enough for exfoliation. The foaming texture is very similar to shiseido white lucent cleanser. My face doesn’t feel tight after cleansing. The cleanser is pricy, much more than I would usually pay for a cleanser. But since you can use the tiniest amount for great results, it doesn’t end up being that bad."
CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,Gentle cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Received this as a complimentary sample and I’m considering getting a full size. I’m in love with this cleanser. It’s gentle on the skin, it does have very fine exfoliant particles in it but again very fine that it won’t irritate the skin. The scent is great too! Very light soothing scent. Also leaves the skin feeling clean but not dry."

CLE DE PEAU-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Canada,So Worth It,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product as a free sample, and just love it!

This cleanser is so incredibly creamy.  Seriously, a tiny bit goes a long way. Add a bit of water, it is working out into a fine foamy lather that isn’t too watery. This one is so good for my dry skin. It leave my skin not only feels clean, but hydrated and smooth. The scent is a gentle fragrant. A kinda earthy floral smell.

You need the tiniest amount because it foams so well it almost has a mousse like texture on the skin when cleansing. It has a light, very clean scent to it and is so soft. It’s not to perfumed. My skin felt deeply cleansed with out being dry or tight feeling afterwards. It is pretty pricy for a cleanser but I do think it’s worth it for the luxurious feel of the product."

CLINIQUE-For Men Face Wash,,Not very sure how I feel about this,"So I got this for my boyfriend because of the good reviews. What happens was, he subsequently developed many small bumps (not pimples) on his face only after using this face wash, which was kind of weird. It has not cleared up at all even tho he has used it for more than 3 months. He's always been using the cheapest face wash out there so his skin is definitely tolerant to some forms of chemicals. He didn't complain about it at all tho, so i guess that's a good thing."
CLINIQUE-For Men Face Wash,,Not very satisfied product!,"I bought this product for my husband. However, 1-2 weeks after using, acnes start appearing in his face. It lasts for 2 weeks, then I asks my husband to stop using it. Maybe it doesn’t suit my husband’s skin type."

CLINIQUE-For Men Face Wash,,Effective!,"Got this for my hubby, who had a couple of zits breaking out after trying out an electric razor for shaving.  Wash seems to have cleared them, and no other zits appearing after using this!

BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Singapore,does its job ,"I have sensitive, combination skin. This cleanser does seem to have a purifying effect, however I find it dries out my skin so I can't use it daily and I have to use a heavy duty moisturiser after. "

BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,New Zealand,Go-to Cleanser,"Have been avid users (including hubby!) of this charcoal cleanser for 2 yrs now. Never had bumps/acne even on our first attempt using the product. Scent not too strong, and pump squeaks the right amount to your palm. But of course it needs a follow through of moisturiser after drying up."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Malaysia,Definitely for stubborn blackheads ,Bought for husband because he has huge problem with blackheads on his nose. So far this get rid the blackheads.

BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Malaysia,miss,My go to cleanser. Cleanses the skin thoroughly and is not drying. A small amount goes a long way and is worth every penny. Reduces acne and blackheads. 
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Singapore,mrs,"can't rave about this cleanser enough for being gentle yet effective. i have very oily, acne-prone skin for reference. this cleanses my skin well and doesn't aggravate my skin. the warming sensation is also v relaxing. "
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Australia,love this! ,"I love this, I’ve previously used the jelly ball cleanser but love this one just as much. Was super shocked the first time I used it, it instantly warmed up as a lathered it up in my hands and stayed warm while applying to the face. The boyfriend loves it too 👌🏼"
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Malaysia,good at first but found it to be too drying ,"A good cleanser at first helped really clean my skin out. But after using it for a long time, I found it really dried out my skin. Skin felt too squeaky clean especially when double cleansing. "

BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Malaysia,Charcoal cleanser ,"Feels warm and good cleaning effect. Love the pump bottle for this cleanser, easy to use. Used it and lasted for 2-3months for me. It doesn’t prevent acne tho but i would repurchase it if its on sale."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Singapore,Cleanse well,"You could feel the heat when you’re cleansing your face, however it feels extremely gentle. Surprisingly no tightness sensation and furthermore it keeps your skin clean and hydrated for a long time. 4 stars as it’s a small bottle and quite pricey. "
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Mmm Love That Warming Effect ~,"I absolutely adore this cleanser and have used it for years but not on a daily basis. For reference, I am 69 years young with normal to dry skin and no issues with pores, only fine lines and wrinkles due to chemotherapy and radiation. I only use it in the shower after I exfoliate with PTR or Dermalogica because I love the way steam opens your pores. It definitely brightens my skin with no dryness and the warming feeling just adds to the experience, it's like a spa day! I would like to address those with breakout problems, at age 69 I've been through it all and have a lot of skincare experience. Please understand that reactionary skin will often purge with different products and the detoxifying charcoal feature is simply clearing your pores which is the purpose. Any skincare product takes time to reveal results, please don't expect miracles overnight. Patience is a virtue when it comes to beautiful glowing skin, just tough it out unless it clearly just isn't for you, I'm talking about major breakouts that really, really get worse. I received this in a sample many years ago and haven't looked back! Prior to the pandemic, I traveled to Mexico frequently and only in that intense humidity did I use it daily.  I just noticed a comment about the price increase and must echo that sentiment ~ I swear it cost half as much the last time I bought it. What's up with that? I will check Boscia's site before I repurchase today, the only downside. Be that as it may, it's an amazing cleanser and I have recommended it to girlfriends in my same age group. They love it too, and one has extremely sensitive reactive skin. Maybe it's for more mature skin? IDK but I hope this helps!"
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Boscia Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,I liked the warming sensation but overall I didn’t notice any improvement in my skin and didn’t find it to be worth buying again.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Pump doesn't work,"I wasn't especially impressed or disappointed by the product itself. However, the pump was very difficult to push down and only a little came out. I saw this on other reviews, but went for it anyway. Less than halfway through the bottle now and the pump will not push down in the slightest. I have to unscrew the cap and use the pump as a dipstick. Hassle not worth the product."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Boscia Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,This is a gentle cleanser that I use every evening as part of my double cleansing routine. I like the warming sensation and how it helps to open up the pores for a deeper cleanse. I haven't noticed any drastic difference in my pores but it keeps them in check and cleanse my skin without overdrying. It has a relatively short list of ingredients (20) including plant extracts and glycolic acid. Made in USA.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,New Zealand,Great for my sensitive skin.,Love the warmth of the product during the massage.  Doesn't flare up my sensitive skin. This is my third purchase and will continue to buy unless ingredients change. Really happy with this product.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Australia,I love this cleanser,"My skin: I’m 45 and have struggled with mild but constant acne my whole adult life, it’s as if my face is super sensitive AND oily ( and of course, now I am old it’s drying up in places). Anyway long story short, my skin is better than it’s been for years: clearer and less noticeable pores, softer texture, generally brighter. And it doesn’t dry me out at all. I am in love! 
"
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,The Prices are Theft,"I love this product. BUT the last time I purchased it, it cost $15. Why is it now $30 for the same size... I am really disheartened by the prices Sephora and these brands are selling their products for. If you double the price, you double the product."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,don't waste your $$,"I was having ok results with clinique so I switched cleansers to this and that was the worst decision. It broke me out so bad and had no control at all of my acne. There is no escape. My skin was oily all day, and I don't think this took off any sebum. I expected more from the cost but now I know to read labels and this only has charcoal which has no evidence behind it. There is nothing in this for acne and the advertising is very misleading. If it weren't a pandemic, this would be returned. The warming is a gimmick and only works with minimal or no water on your skin."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Won’t buy again,"I’m not a fan sadly. I didn’t notice a change in my skin at all and I’ve been using it for quite some time, for the price tag I wanted a little more."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Singapore,Good effective cleanser,"This cleanser has been a staple in my cleansing routine for several years now. It is effective in cleansing and clearing comedones – be it blackhead or whitehead. Though it can leave skin a bit drier when it is used both in the morning and at night, or consecutively over several days. I would suggest alternating it with another mild cleanser in your cleansing routine. I also use it for cleansing my shoulders or back whenever there are bumps or the occasional pimples on these areas.
"
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,One of my staples,My favorite go-to cleanser for some years now. No other cleanser has been so effective at leaving my face so clean & clear.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Boscia Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,"I really like this product. it leaves my face feeling fresh and clean without being harsh on the skin. I would say my skin is normal to oily, but it worked really well for me."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,The only cleanser for me,"I have oily and acne prone skin. I used Proactiv throughout out my twenties. Worked great as long as I stuck with my routine. I am now in my thirties and it was drying out my skin. I was advised by a skincare professional to stop using it. Everytime I stop using Proactiv, my face starts breaking out really bad after two months. I have been Proactiv free for over a year and all thanks to this cleanser! I tried about 3 other brands and none of them gave me lasting results like this one did. It gives a good clean without leaving my skin dry. No perfume smells, warms alittle that feels great on my face and it has kept my acne at bay."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Australia,not bad,"This product does what it suggests, it does heat up a little and feels clean on the skin, I just wish it would wash away my eye make up better, as I still look like a panda unless I use it twice as least. "
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Great for sensitive skin with acne,"Clean ingredients and cleans your skin without feeling sticky, dry, or sensitive after. In fact, i use this twice daily on a prescription strength tretinoin treatment and experienced no irritation due to this cleanser. Also, since making the switch my pores have shrunk to where ican't even feel them, or see them,  anymore. Also, this is the only line at sephora which makes their products in apharmaceutical grade facility. This means that the product literally never touches any remnant of human skin or breath until it touches your skin. Especially during a pandemic, i cannot place any other brand on the same level."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,effective deep cleanser,LOVE this cleanser.....deep clean feeling.... removes most makeup
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Australia,Good for everday use,"Its good for everyday use. It does not make your skin dry after using it, nor does it irritate your skin. it does the job, the skin feels fresh clean."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Best Face Cleanser Ever!,"I love this cleanser!  I’m 58 years young and this cleanser has done wonders for my maturing skin. My pores have shrunk and it’s made my skin so smooth! I gave my husband a bottle and he loves it too says it’s the best face cleanser he’s ever used and the warming sensation is a nice touch! Buy this, you won’t regret it!"
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Love it! It work for my pore,I love it! Whenever I apply this product on my skin. I can totally feel the burn and after wash my face i feel so clean. My pore is getting smaller and smaller and my reduce are slowly gone.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,New Zealand,LOVE this product!,"I have PCOS so I have a very hormonally charged face,so I  cant just put any product on my face or  I get redness, flakiness and cystic acne break outs. I use this product at night after I take off my makeup and it leaves my face feeling so clean ready for bed. It lathers up really nice and feels warm and refreshing. it has helped with some of the really stubborn parts of my face that are prone to break outs and deep pits.  Would definitely buy this again."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Singapore,will not buy again,firstly this is not cheap. there are other products that serves its purpose and does the same or even better job. this cleanser has a weird smell. the heating gel doesn't do anything more or beneficial for my face either. will not buy again as i feel this is expensive.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Australia,my favourite everyday cleanser ,"My favourite everyday cleanser! I have pretty sensitive skin, this cleanser is just so calm on my skin every time when I use it, do a good cleaning job. I like the heat temperature on my face every time when I use it for cleaning my makeup (easy makeup for the day). I have bought so many bottles already, totally recommend this product!"
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Boscia Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,My all time favorite cleanser. I have combination/dry skin. My skin always feels so clean after but not stripped. Good ingredients too.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Solid staple in my arsenal,"I have used this cleanser for about 3 years as one of my nighttime second cleanses or as a morning cleanse.
Great for your pores but not at all stripping and never makes your skin feel tight. The gently warming sensation happens when first applying and then diminishes. Very skin-tertaining!
This cleanser does brighten and aids in texture and evening out skin tone. Know that this is a light glycolic acid (AHA) as well as salicylic acid (BHA) wash with added benefits of vitamin c, licorice root and of coarse, charcoal. Great way to get in treatments as well as washing your face!
Love this in the Summer when my skin is more oily or when I first get up in the morning. I have combination skin but when I amp up my percentage of Retin A and my skin is dry and sensitive I set this aside for a week as it can sting.

You will notice it helps with blackheads, breakouts, oil control and even skin tone. Not harsh or aggressive just gentle, effective and a sexy black eclair with a gel like consistency."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Boscia Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,"Has a nice warming sensation while cleansing, skin feel nice and clean after washing."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Solid cleanser,This was a solid cleanser I used for a few months at night. I wouldn’t say it transformed my skin but it definitely didn’t hurt my skin. I prefer clear bottles so you know how much is left but that’s not really boscia’s aesthetic.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Australia,My Favourite Cleanser,"This is hands down my all time favourite cleanser. It has a honey like texture when you dispense it, and as you rub it actually heats up in your hands. It is the best make up removing cleanser I have ever used. It just seems to love my skin. "
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,breakouts,I broke out in spots where acne is usually never a problem. This really didn’t make a noticeable difference for my pores either. Maybe my skin just didn’t react well to a certain ingredient. This is one of the first products I had to just throw away.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Boscia girl yes!,My face is super sensitive so it’s hard to find a good cleanser! I’ve been using this for over a year now and it leaves my face feeling fresh!!! I love it a little goes a long way!
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,BLACK HEAD ERASER!,"I LOVE this cleanser. At first I was skeptical, but then after using it for over a month. I’ve noticed less blackheads appearing around my nose. If I notice I have any, I’ll go in with this cleanser and I swear (if your blackheads aren’t really deep) this cleanser goes into your pores and removes all the black spots. I’ve never used a cleanser that does this. I’ve always had to use a mask or pore strips to get rid of my black heads. So if you struggle with them pesky little black dots... this is the cleanser for you!!"
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,DON’T BUY,I broke out like crazy after this cleaner. DO NOT BUY!
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Great all around cleaner!,"I ran out of face wash before my new one had time to arrive in the mail so I found an old sample size of this in my bathroom and decided to use it while I waited for my usual cleanser. For the past couple weeks, this has been awesome. I can definitely see a difference for my combo dry/greasy skin with large pores, dark spots, and occasional cystic acne.  My skin feels so clean and smooth but not dried out AT ALL (most cleaners make my face feel tight) plus my skin also looks a bit brighter and my pores tighter. I like it so much that even after my usual cleanser arrived, I still use this one at night for a deeper clean. A little goes a long way so I'm not in a rush to get the full size yet but I will say, I'm 100% considering adding this into my skin care routine permanently. 

One warning though, I did have a small skin purge on my chin where I rarely break out but it is healing pretty fast. My skin purges anytime I use a new product and this one was mild as far as purging goes."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Malaysia,boscia black charcoal cleanser,"it does clear my pores, but it doesnt clear my acne, my acne getting worse by using this cleanser, maybe it doesnt suit my skin condition. 

if u have no problem with acne just wants to clear pores this is the right products "

BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Boscia Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,I’ve been using this for years and never want to use anything else. It really feels like it cleans without stripping it. I have combo/very acne prone skin and this has really helped my breakouts. While using this I have completely clear skin. Plus a bottle lasts forever.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Best cleanser !,"This product is  amazing and the best cleanser I’ve used. I used to be on accutane because I had bad breakouts. I have been off for a couple years, and was looking for a cleanser that could give me that mattifying effect I like. This cleanser not only cleans my skin, but I wake up with a dry face that isn’t slathered in oil. This is the only cleanser that accomplishes this. I also have no breakouts while using this."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,LOVE IT!!,"It’s my go-to favorite cleanser. It leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed. I’ve noticed since using it, I’ve had less breakouts, I still get the occasional pimple but overall it’s a really good cleanser. The bottle also lasts a long time so you really get your money’s worth on this one."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Worth it,I’ve been using this for like a year now and I love how it makes my face feel. Very clean and doesn’t make my more dry areas feel too dried out.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,It worked for me,"This product is great! I was going through a hormone therapy and my skin broke out really bad. However, this face wash cleared my skin up and helped with dark marks on my face as well. It doesn’t over dry my skin and it really does leave my skin feeling radiant."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Boscia Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,I like how it kinda heats up when you rub it in between your hands. Has helped with my acne and has surfaced some of my acne that is deep.

BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Really great product!,"I bought this cleanser for my (fairly skeptical) husband, and he loves it! I noticed his face looking brighter after just a few days, and our family members have noticed that it even reduces the prominence of his acne scars. The product itself feels very light and clean, and I'm looking forward to getting it for myself when my current cleanser runs out!"
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Horrible,Horrible . Makes you get more pimples . It does give that fresh clean look on your skin but then you wake up with twice the pimples . I have been using this for a month maybe to see if my skin with get used to it but i have NEVER seen my skin so bad . And i usually don’t get a lot of pimples on my face

BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,,Great for pores,"I used to have an issue with black heads but after using this for a couple weeks I could notice they were reducing drastically. I’m now on my third bottle and will probably never swap to another cleanser. It does the job, is nourishing and doesn’t dry the skin. Great cleanser!
"
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Just okay,"I thought this was okay, as I got this in a boscia faves gift set for christmas. I think theres a cheaper dupe that's sold at the drugstore with the warming effect. My bf actually liked it and he decided he wanted to take it for himself. I didnt see anything worthwhile from using it myself so I let him have it"
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,This is NOT a purge!,"I used to break out in my twenties and thirties but since I’ve been in my forties, it’s a rare occurrence. I started using this cleanser about two weeks ago and I’ve been breaking out. Because my acne-prone days are behind me, I feel confident this isn’t a temporary purge. The breakouts are even in odd places for me, such as above my upper lip and on my neck. I wish I knew which ingredient is the problem so I can avoid it in the future. If you have even slightly breakout prone skin, avoid this! It didn’t help with oil either."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Boscia Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,My go to wash. Really removes makeup from your pores. I do two washes to be sure if I have a heavier makeup day. Doesn’t overly dry skin.  Looks clean and refreshed after washing.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Boscia Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,"My absolute favorite cleanser. Ever! Periodt. 
I can say this confidently because I have been repurchasing for a good 6 years. So, the love is real. A small amount goes a long way, and it does a superb job at cleansing the day away. I can’t ever get over the warming effect it has. If you are looking for a new cleanser to try, I recommend this one!"
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Boscia Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Best cleanser hands down. The only cleanser that cleans every spec of makeup off.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Best cleanser ever!!!,"I normally don't leave reviews, but I've repurchased this product too many times not to sing it's praises! I've tried to buy more affordable brands (won't put em on blast lol) but I always end up discarding those and buying this. I love how it warms up on my face and it gives a good amount of lather. Smells clean, but not strong like perfume. I have oily-combo skin in the warmer months that goes dry in the winter and I use this cleanser all year long. If you were on the fence go check it out. You won't be disappointed!!!"
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Boscia Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,I have been struggling with acne for the past few years and didn’t think anything would work to clear it up. I’ve been using this cleanser consistently for a few months now and am so incredibly happy! I haven’t had any large breakouts and any small blackhead I get is super easy to extract. So excited that I tried this product :)
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Really Cleans & exfoliates the skin,This is the best cleaner for getting a cleaner skin after applying makeup. Gets rid of all the residue & also mascara which used to be a big issue for me. But for years I’ve been using this product & it really helps.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Boscia Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,This is crazy!!! The warming effect feels so good and is a super weird feeling. You need to try it out to experience this odd but cool feeling. It’s also really effective I have acne and I have tried a few products but none seem to work. I am seeing a difference in my skin with this. I also don’t think this would work to well with dry skin I have always had really oily skin and after using this product it definitely got a little dry. But overall I recommend it
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,"Great product, bad pump :(",The sample I tried was great...my the PUMP is AWFUL. I have to try it like 15 times to get enough out to use.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Really good,I had tried this in a travel size and loved it. This brand is super good.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Made My (cystic?) Acne Disappear in Less than A We,"I never leave reviews but had to for this one. Prior to switching to this cleanser, I was using Tatcha, another Japanese skincare brand, which I really wanted to love based on their ingredients and pretty packaging. I wasn't sure if I was breaking out these past few months due to this cleanser or due to traveling so much, as I tend to have ""sensitive"" skin in the sense that if I travel somewhere and sleep on sheets that aren't mine, it causes my face to break out. 

I actually used Boscia in the past and loved it, but obviously with all the different products out there and marketing hype, it's easy to get distracted. Tired of breaking out and using tea tree oil with only somewhat moderate success, I remember I had a travel size of this in my skincare closet. The first time I used it, my skin felt pretty dry, so I used an oil to moisturize, which I tend to normally do anyway. Within the 24 hours, holy crap, my painful pimples/acne were going down and disappearing. I've used this product for less than a week, but my skin has been rapidly clearing up. It's amazing. I get hyperpigmentation, so I'll probably have to exfoliate or something to help reduce the dark marks, but I'm never straying cleansers again. Boscia for the win!"
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,,good,Warm feeling cleanser foam is exquisite and won't feel dry foam cleanser very comfortable 😌 no essence ingredients to join is very useful to stimulate the viscous gel
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,perfect for oily skin,"will never use another face wash, I'm so in love with it. perfect for oily skin"
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Cheap pump bottle,This is a 5 star product in a 1 star container. It broke within days of purchase. I won’t be using this brand again.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,,Fantastic,"Certainly does create a warm feeling on your face. Doesn't burn though. My skin is much clearer. Broke out to start with, but Now smoother and less red. Smoother to touch. "
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Boscia Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,"I thought I’d try this cleanser to help fight blackheads on/around my nose and chin. To be honest, this did nothing for me in the sense that my skin seemed to be unaffected by it after drying. That being said, if you don’t have acne or blackheads, live in a cold environment, and simply want a cleanser that warms you up - this could be perfect for you!"
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Awesome product!,"Love this product! I’ve suffered with acne prone skin all my adult life so I am very cautious of the products that I use. After being on meds and proactive- good product, just not effective for when you’re approaching the middle age mark, I bought this product for weekend use, when the makeup comes off and I wanted something softer on my skin, to give my skin a rest from the daily beat. It’s amazingly cleansing and gentle. I don’t have any fear for breakouts and the blemishes I do have are not so pronounced.  I will definitely purchase this product again."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Change Packaging,"Packaging sucks. Thinking I was done, was about to throw away. Opened it, plenty to use, but didn’t pump out no more. Makes me think of how much money I’ve previously thrown in trash. Great product, bad packaging."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Boscia Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,Dont see a difference using this cleanser. Does not clean very well.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Disappointed,"After using Biore's charcoal cleanser, I thought about giving this one a try after all the rave about it. After 3 weeks of using it, I'm extremely disappointed in this cleanser. 
All it did was make my face extremely dry after washing, giving me that ashy look. Also it broke me out bad. I had about 5 breakouts within a week. I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt that it was purging my skin, but the breakouts seem to get bad and my face is dry after use."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Oh it’s good,"This product does what it says it does. I feel best results are when used in the shower, when I dry my face off the dry/dead skin and just yuck come off. It takes more product than I thought. I haven’t owned for long enough to access the ration of being worth it. I have eczema and this is the best face cleaner I have came across, so I may value it more for that reason alone. I don’t care for the smell, but I wouldn’t say it “sticks” with you, for longer than while applied."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Works like magic!,"I had been battling acne, dull tired skin the last few years due to stress and poor diet. I was on a mission to turn my skin around and this product was instrumental in doing so. You can feel it working with the warm tingly sensation it creates when you apply it to your wet face. You don’t need more than a drop because it lathers and foams really well. A great value!"
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,"if you have adult acne, try this product.","I love this facial cleanser!  I have less frequent adult acne break outs thanks to this cleanser.  I follow up with witch hazel as a toner.  Of course the Boscia mask is a plus with the cleanser.  I have combination skin and hyper pigmentation.  So my skin is not perfect, but this cleanser helps a lot."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Love This Product,"I absolutely LOVE this product! I have combination to oil skin. It’s PERFECT in the summer. It unclogs your pores and leaves your skin refreshed. In the winter make sure to use a moisturizer because i could be a bit abrasive (obviously skin is drier in the winter).
I’ve bought it 3 times already. Sephora is one of my favorite stores and i like to explore with different brands and products but always come back to this one. I highly recommend it!!"
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Nice warming clean cleanser,I always come back to this cleanser. Great for winter months with the warmthening effect. Always leaves my face actually feeling clean. The only down side is traveling with it the top nozzle is delicate and will break.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Lifesaver,"So, I am currently going through my first pregnancy. One of the side effects from being pregnant is OILY skin I am getting along with hormonal acne. I have never been this oily in my entire life. If the U.S. government found out how oily my skin is, they would've invaded by now. It's quite difficult to find cleansers/products that are formulated without salicylic acid to help fight acne since it should be avoided during pregnancy. I heard from a friend on how much she loved this cleanser but never really it gave it much thought until a few months ago. So during my research in finding a new cleanser, I figured I would listen to my friend and give this a try. While I still have some breakouts due to the hormones, this cleanser has been a huge help keeping my oil and acne in check. I really should've listened to her months ago because this is the first cleanser that helps keep my horrible acne at bay, doesn't irritate my skin, doesn't turn my skin red, and doesn't leave my skin feeling tight or dry. My husband has even commented that this is the best my skin has ever looked and we've been together for 5 years now."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,New favorite cleanser!,I really like this cleanser. It’s super gentle and doesn’t dry out my face. My face appears more even and brighter. A little goes a long way so the large bottle will last me a good while. The pump makes for easy product dispensing which is a plus for me. It also works well with my Clarisonic and dermalogica products.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,,"Eh, too expensive ","It’s not worth the price point. It cleanses skin well, and leaves your skin soft and supple, but there are a lot of other cleanses that do that for a lot less money "
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Boscia Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,I have some adult acne and its the only thing I have ever used that clears my skin. I have introduced a few other people to this cleanser and they also love it. I refuse to do without it.
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Boscia Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,"The best cleanser ever! I don't like use the same cleanser when I ran out of old one, and I tried cleanser from multiple brands like estee Lauder, sheshido, fresh... this is the first time I want to buy the same thing again but for the larger version! I feel my pore is more clean even the first time I used it, right now I use half of them, and it feels still good."
BOSCIA-Detoxifying Black Charcoal Cleanser,USA,Nice Product,"Based on the reviews, I was nervous to try this product, I am oily/combo. But I like love this cleanser. My face doesn't feel tight afterwards, just clean. I see the change in my texture and tone. I also see more illuminous skin. This cleanser is a keeper!"

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Philippines,Overpriced Face Wipe,This product does its job as it should and is relatively thicker than drugstore face wipes. However I don’t see this as enough justification for its price. I don’t think I’ll buy this again unless to fill up my cart for a certain promo

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Singapore,Not as good as the old exfoliating wipes. ,"I prefer the old version or the previous version of the exfoliating wipes. I have been using the previous version for years. I use them once a week on my face and twice a week on my lips. The previous version exfoliated all my dead skin on my lips, neck, T-zone and décolletage. This new version…. The exfoliating side is just “bumpy”; doesn’t exfoliate at all. Very disappointed. Will not repurchase again. "

Lazy girl's best beauty friend but keep in mind that it is not a replacement for your cleanser."

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,New Zealand,Simply perfect ,I really love this face wipe. My skin seems so bright and clean. Super recommended. I use it normally at night to clean and a mask after sleep and is really wonderful . I definitely will buy more and more for long time. The gel is perfect as well
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Australia,It's Eh,To be honest I've had better wipes. It's efficient to have one wiping dead cells and the other wipes makeup but it was a little difficult trying to scrub (not wipe) scrub off the makeup. My face ended up pink from how hard I had to scrub. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,New Zealand,Ughh,"Smells like disinfecting wipes, thick wipes, does the job at removing makeup though"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Malaysia,all time favorite ,these wipes are  a must have for me. It easily wipe of eye makeup without irritating my eyes. This is a repeated purchase already. Tries different shades but the grapefruit  is the best.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Australia,not bad,"not bad for a quick freshen up if needed. wouldn't make it a part of my daily routine as my face felt a bit sticky afterwards, but nice to have in your desk at work if you need a freshen up"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,New Zealand,smells nice,These wipes smell very nice and fresh. They are kind of harsh on your skin though and I wouldn’t recommend using them around your eye or mouth area as they make my skin kind of irritated.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,New Zealand,not bad,This product definitely does the job of removing makeup but it doesn’t leave my skin feeling exfoliated and not necessarily as clean either - mainly as it feels like it leaves a residue on the skin. It does remove makeup though and I have had no reactions from the product so can’t be too bad 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,New Zealand,great for removing makeup ,"Have bought multiple packs of these as they remove makeup so well and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh, they’ve become my go to wipes for removing make up!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Singapore,Good for oily skin,"My husband likes to use these wipes midday during work if he starts to feel too sweaty or oily. He says he likes them a lot and they help refresh his skin and face. So he doesn’t use these to replace his daily skin washing routine or as a makeup remover. The only qualm he has is that he worries that he actually removes all his nice skin care products that he uses in the morning, but who knows. My only problem with Sephora brand products is that they are not 100% cruelty free. Being “against animal testing” but selling to countries that require it is NOT anti-animal testing and is definitely not cruelty free. But these were the best wipes for his skin needs so it makes me sad about that. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Australia,Face wipes,Smells really nice and fruity
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Singapore,Sephora Collection Exfoliating Facial Wipes - Grapefruit ,"The wipes are sufficiently moist to remove the dirt & oil on the face.

"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Australia,A little on the dry side,I think a bit more moisture might be required for these face wipes as they are a bit dry in the pack.  This then means you have to be quite aggressive when removing makeup and cleansing skin.  I won’t be buying them again.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Australia,bring back the old formula!,the new exfoliating wipes are crap and don't do the job half as well as the old ones! bring back the old exfoliating wipes! the old ones with the rough surface work so well why did you have to change it?
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Australia,Exfoliating Face Wipes,I love these wipes. On one side they are smooth so you can take your makeup off and the other you can use to give your skin a mild exfoliation. Two uses out of one product what more can you ask for. Your skin is left clean and smooth. Try them and you’ll not be disappointed.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Australia,quick clean ,So perfect to put into your makeup bag if you need it for travels or holidays. Quick and easy. Removes dirt and any other yuckies from the skin like a liquid exfoliate would. So recommend if you just need to do your skin care routine quickly this is perfect no need to wash afterwards. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Singapore,SEPHORA COLLECTION Exfoliating Face Wipe ,"SEPHORA COLLECTION Exfoliating Face Wipe isn't too harsh for skin (even if you use it daily). It can be use to remove makeup as well. The package isn't too big or heavy, good for travelling. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Australia,wipe away,I find so many wipes just don’t get the makeup off but these do. The rough side is great for scrubbing off the makeup gently but also has a smooth side for the delicate areas. I will continue buying these as they do the job so much better than any others.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Australia,Bad! Not the same as the mini packs ,"They are not the same as the mini versions. They do have a exfoliating side but it is just as smooth as the other side 😭. Will still use them as they still keep my skin clean but won’t be buying the big pack again. 
"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Singapore,Yessss Love it,Love it..... There is a 2 sides to this. You have the smooth part and also the rough part where you can wipe those waterproof mascara or eyeliner off. Great item from Sephora but sadly most items are sold out online during and before the sale. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Singapore,exfoliates ,Not sure if they’ve revised the packaging for this but to me it feels exactly the same as the charcoal exfoliating wipes that I always restock. The packing looks a little different. But it works just as great as the other one. It really helps exfoliates white heads on my nose and chin. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Australia,Great,"removes all my make up in one wipe, smell is amazing and my skin feels and looks great after every use. the exfoilating is a bonus. price is good for what the product does "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Malaysia,like the smell,"I like the smell of this product , this wipe really can gently remove unwanted dead skin on your neck and behind ur neck .I use the wipe to wipe my tattooed arm too. it make it looked newly tattooed arm. maybe because I removed those dull skin ."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Malaysia,easy to use ,"the texture of the wipe is suitable even for male usage . I use it twice a day , it still didn't cause any irritation on my face. it is very convenient to use . "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Malaysia,❤,Use it once or twice a week of needed. So far loving it. Make sure hand is clean since need to use both sides. Smell is ok & convenient to bring everywhere. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Exfoliating Face Wipe,Malaysia,easy way out wipes,I normally use this after a long day at work and I'm too exhausted for heavy duty cleaning!!! .....smells divine but doesn't remove water proof eye makeup...which is my only gripe! other than that yeah I'd recommend this! I still prefer the mini versions than the original...its cleans better 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,New Zealand,The Best,"Love this cleanser, especially when traveling to dry climates. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Australia,first aid beauty ,This is perfect for sensitive skin and it’s lightly scented so it’s very helpful for skin that is prone to irritation or brake outs id recommended it as a l gentle  wash if you have acne scars you are trying to heal 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Singapore,decent enough ,Does the job and is pretty value for money compared with other brands.. However it doesn't give the squeaky clean feeling so you'll have to rinse well to make sure there's no residue.. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Singapore,great ,Like the texture and the cleaning effect but I don’t really adore the smell of the cleanser. It is even a bit off putting for me personally but my family loves it. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Australia,Ms,"Love this gentle cleanser. a little bit goes a long way. doesn’t make my skin feel right after cleansing. it also has pretty good value for its price 
"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Singapore,ok only,"Expensive for such a small tube and I don’t see any difference between this and a cosrx cleanser tbh. I alternate between both and whenever I used this, my face don’t get as oily as the other one. I think it’s quite gentle, doesn’t have much foam. BUT the smell sucks. Smell like petroleum or some minerals. The smell is so bad I hate it but it’s expensive need to finish it. Won’t repurchase. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,Gentle,"This is my moms fav cleanser, its gentle, doesn't sting the eyes and doesn't strip the skin or leave a greasy feeling. She doesn't wear makeup so she doesn't double cleanse but this cleanser does thoroughly remove her sunscreen and dirt from the day."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Australia,Lovely cleanser for oily to combo skin ,"I repurchased this twice as I really loved it!! It cleansed my skin and didn’t leave it feeling stripped at all. I purchased it a 3rd time and it was right around the time my skin went from combo and changed to dry, I don’t really love it the way I used to as my skin needs have now changed. I recommend this for oily to combo skin types "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Australia,Best cleanser ever ,Bought this as a travel size to test it out and see if it was worth all the hype it was getting on tiktok and it was! Came back once it was finished and bought the full size bottle. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Singapore,FAB Cleaner,Love this product. Gentle enough for my sensitive skin and I've made multiple purchase during the sales to stock up. Loving the price point too!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Australia,squeaky clean ,I purchased this product with higher expectations than what it delivered. I must say it last for a very long time and a little bit goes a long way but I find my skin feeling too tight and dry after using this. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Australia,ms,Nice & good ingredients made me choose this cleanser. As my simple cleanser is running out I really needed a new cleanser & this time I wanted to try a new brand other than Pharmecy brand & I found the perfect one as it doesn’t have any glycolic in it.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,Love it,"Perfect cleanser! I just put 5 stas because it has a smell, like the product has a strange smell, but it cleans perfectly and it's my favorite!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Singapore,Performs well.,"A gentle cleanser that doesn't dry out the skin. Quite value for money too, especially during sale. A gentle cleanser that doesn't dry out the skin. Quite value for money too, especially during sale."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Australia,holy grail,this is a holy grail product for me and my partner. wish it was more affordable but it lasts a while and we will probably buy anyway. we try to grab it during the beauty pass sales. great compliment to other products in the range.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Australia,love it,"Fell in love with this product.

……….                                                                                    "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,A true go-to for acne prone sensitive skin,"Love this product, i havent had any irritation on my sensitive skin and my face is left feeling clean but not dry. I removed a star because the product separates which leaves me having to shake it up for a fair consistency, which is not very user friendly in this toothpaste-style tube."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,Gave me red dots all over my face,It’s really bad. gave me oddly shaped red small blemishes. My skin for some reason hates good products that are better for your face. My skin prefers strong chemicals that’ll burn off acne. Most would say it’s breaking my skin barrier but good products can’t even make me keep one.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,"Amazing product, iffy price","I’m obsessed with this face wash. It is so great for sensitive skin and no matter how many times I try different brands, I always come back to this one! It makes my skin feel smooth and not too taut after, even before moisturizer. The only downside is the price… while I love the product, I often struggle justifying spending that much on a face wash."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,All time favourite!,"I love everything about this cleanser. The smell...the texture...the colour...the way it lathers...the feel on my skin....the clean hydrated feeling it leaves behind. This cleaner is quite the experience and i thoroughly enjoyed it. Its safe for all skin types including sensitive skin as its free from fragrance, drying alcohol and essential oils. Its a must have for any routine. The sensory experience is amaze-balls!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Singapore,Love it!,First time using a cleanser from this brand. Saw really good reviews about it so I decided to try. I have combination acne prone skin and this cleanser is perfect for my skin. My face felt really smooth after using this. I would purchase this again. Highly recommend! 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,A must have in my skin cycling routine,Must have. I use this when my face is a little dry and I need a gentle cleanser. Love that it foams up. I also use this during my skin cycling routine.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Malaysia,very good cleanser ,Love this cleanser although the funky smell. It leaves you skin moisturise after cleaning and feels my skin brighten up too. This cleanser always sold out because it’s too good. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Malaysia,best clean product cleanser,Love this cleanser although the funky smell. It leaves you skin moisturise after cleaning and feels my skin brighten up too. This cleanser always sold out because it’s too good. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,Red dried out face,"Have tried to answer the question on this site three times, that someone asked if this was good for mature skin and each time they said to try again later!!!  Why?  Annoying!  Purchased this item because it stated good for redness and sensitive skin.  It is neither.  My face is red and raw after using and dries out my face badly.  Would not purchased another FAB product ever."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,First Aid Beauty Face Cleanser - 142g,My favorite cleanser.  Removes makeup quite well and doesn't dry my skin.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,Great for the simple days,This is such a nice simple cleaner. It makes me skin feel so moisturized and i grab it whenever i feel like my face needs a pick me up
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Australia,Miss,"Great cleanser, good for sensitive skin and eyes"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Philippines,Best Cleanser,"This has become my favorite cleanser. It’s great for what it is, and does all its claims. I ended up buying the biggest size this time as it keeps selling out, and I can’t switch to any other cleanser without sacrificing quality, and how my skin feels."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Philippines,"Gentle, and Hydrating","A product that does all its claims. This works great for dry, and sensitive skin. I’ve had to buy this in every size as I always go back to it, and it usually sells out fast."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Philippines,Top Choice,"This cleanser is truly gentle, and hydrating. It works great for dry, and sensitive skin. A product that really does all its claims. It’s no wonder it’s in every list of everyone’s recommended cleansers, including dermatologists."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Australia,awesome at removing makeup,A really good cleanser that does a great job of removing makeup and sunscreen and making my skin feel clean yet hydrated at the same time. I bought a full size after trying the mini and will definitely keep purchasing. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,My saving grace since 2013,"I have been using this cleanser since 2013, and it is quite literally the only face wash that doesn't break me out. It cleanses and removes makeup, so I've never needed to purchase any kind of makeup remove. This stuff can take off waterproof mascara. It's extremely gentle and non-drying. No joke, I relied on this cleanser through two years of accutane during high school, and I have never had any problems. I have nightmare skin that breaks out if the wind blows wrong, so I introduced the FAB cleanser very slowly and carefully to see how my skin would react. My skin is also tough because its both dry and acne-prone. Luckily, this stuff has legit never done me wrong. It was the only step in my skincare routine for many years. Also-- it's pretty concentrated, so you only need a small amount to wash your whole face. A full size tube will last me at least 6 months. You need to wet your face thoroughly first and then apply the cleanser and lather. Also keep your eyes shut while washing because it stings slightly if it gets in your eyes (I guess that would be my only ""complaint""). Overall this stuff has been a life saver for me and I can't recommend it enough."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,the best!,Only cleanser I use- switched to this about 2 years ago and it removes make up and oils without stripping skin
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,really drying out my skin,used for 6 months and didn't realize till later that it was really drying out my skin.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,This Product is My Band-Aid!!!,Love ❤️  this product ... first time user.  Skin is looking better and cleanses the face!  Great makeup remover.  Does not take alot either.  Highly recommend it.  It's been worth the investment because I do NOT use soap on my face. Haven't since I was a kid.  This is perfect!!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,"Very thin product, bad packaging","I'm not sure if they've changed the formula, but the bottle I got is not the thick, creamy version I see in pictures. It is very thin and watery. The down-facing squeeze tube is not good packaging for a formula like this; I have to hold the bottle upside down, and gingerly tip the bottle down to get the product out which will easily just flow out of the tube. In fact, it will get everywhere if I'm not careful. 

As for the performance of the product, it's ok. It doesn't break me out , irritate my sensitive skin, and it cleanses well without over stripping.  It just doesn't perform any better or worse than my preferred cheaper drugstore cleanser. Perhaps if it was the thick, creamy formula advertised I would have liked it better."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,Helped with hormonal oil!,I have only been using this a week and am seeing a great difference in oil tackling. I was on hormonal medication and my skin went down hill fast. It’s been clogged and so so oily. The oil reduction has made my skin significantly less puffy. I will be purchasing again.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,HOLY GRAIL,My absolute holy grail face wash. Makes my skin feel clean but not too dry. Does not compare to other face washes for me!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,"So clean and smooth, buy!","This product will leave your face feeling so clean and fresh without feeling like a layer of skin was removed. I have dry skin and felt like it didn't overly dry me out, left me nourished and hydrated. I highly recommend this product"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,Truly Awful Scent,"This is an effective and gentle cleanser - it works great! I just can’t get over the truly awful scent, which is very sour-smelling and smells like something is rotting."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,Moldy smell,"It smells horrible. 
It's like using moldy products to clean face. YUCK! 
La Roche-Posay's Toleriane Purifying Foaming Face Wash or Fresh's Soy pH-Balanced Hydrating Face Wash will do a better job without the moldy smell."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,Holy Grail!,Love it!!! Doesn’t break me out and removes my makeup very well. It’s my go to. If I try something else I always go back to this one. Nothing has worked as well as this cleanser for my skin.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Malaysia,good,"A good cleanser that makes my face fresh but again nothing to special about it, just in a good range, but better buy the bigger size if you would like to repurchase "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Australia,first aid beauty,"This is a white cream cleanser. It is fragrance free and doesn't irritate my skin or break me out. It's not very foaming, but because I feel like a) a lot of products add something to make it foam because people expect and therefore like it and b) as a second cleanser, particularly for dryer skin I don't need a foam that doesn't bother me. If I have makeup on I use a Micellar water, or recently I'm trying a cleansing balm, and then this. I feel like this removes dirt and oil without drying out my skin."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,First Aid Beauty Face Cleanser - 142g,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is definitely not for me. I found it very drying, but the nail in the coffin was the scent. Just a terrible scent to this cleanser. Pass."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,creamy and gentle,"Gentle, creamy, and lathers well. This cleanser cleans my skin really well and makes my skin look refreshed and bright. Works really well on my combination acne-prone skin."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Australia,The best cleanser,This is the best cleanser available. It’s light and gentle on the skin yet still removes all makeup and leave your face feeling clean and refreshed. Highly recommend this product!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,First Aid Beauty Face Cleanser - 142g,Love this cleanser. It’s very soothing and reduces redness. It has not caused breakouts for me and seems to remove my make up well too.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,My favorite cleanser,"It has a white iridescent feel to it and isn’t fragrant. It has A tad oaty smell to it but I do not mind that because I know the oats are part of the ingredients. It’s effective at getting the makeup right off, and doesn’t strip the skin. It’s more expensive than a cerave, Cetaphil or vanicream but it’s just as gentle and effective. I do feel as though I get a lot of use for my money and it’s definitely got a luxury feel to it. I’ve tried everything from Dunk Elephant to Tatcha and I prefer this far and beyond."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,A very effective cleanser,"This worked very well for me, after years of gentle cleansers that didn't really get ALL of my foundation/makeup off. I would always find some color left on cotton pads when I used toner after. This one really gets it ALL, for a much cleaner face. The one knock is that it is slightly drying for me, but just moisturizing after takes care of that. On the whole it's been good for my skin and I'll be sticking with this."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,First Aid Beauty Face Cleanser - 142g,Amazing so far!!! I’ve finally switched from YTTP kale superfood cleanser and the FAB cleanser is way better. It actually cleans out my pores without irritating my eczema. It’s perfectly gentle for daily use
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,It was just okay,This face wash reminded me of the Keihl’s oil free cleanser because my skin felt very clean after I used it. It wasn’t necessarily drying but it wasn’t hydrating either. I had to moisturize asap or my skin felt dry. I think it would be good for the summer. It also smelled like the Keihl’s cleanser. I gave it 3 stars cuz it burns if it gets into my eyes but other than that it’s your basic cleanser. It has good ingredients and it’s fragrance free.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,New Zealand,OMG,"This is 150% one of THE BEST cleansers I’ve bought…and the price tag?!? So good, it’s unreal how a cleanser with a small price tag is this efficient and effective "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,Finally!!!,I have been on the struggle bus my entire life on finding something that didn’t take a layer of skin off. I have tried hundreds of products labeled sensitive skin. Each of the leaving my skin dry and damaged. I was desperate to find something for daily use. Since coming off birth control my skin is now prone to acne so I needed something more than ever. So I bought this along with a few other first aide beauty products. This cleanser is amazing. It removes make up and cleans my pores well. I have less and less black heads each week. It cleanses while leaving my skin hydrated with no skin irritation. It doesn’t cut through that protective moisture barrier like most cleansers!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,Perfect daily gentle cleanser,"I suffer from acne, rosacea, and eczema on my face. I've tried other gentle cleansers (Cerave, Cetaphil, Neutrogena, La Roche Posay, etc) but I always come back to this one. It's a milky white cream coming out and lathers enough to really clean your face without stripping it. It has no fragrance, no actives, but some soothing inactive ingredients. This isn't gonna be the flashiest product, but she'll be the Libra in your life: gets along with almost anyone, is comforting, and likes to maintain balance. Also, it comes in a  jumbo pump which is great if you're handicapped/disabled/clumsy."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Malaysia,good!,good facial wash for its price! Hence it’s always sold out. I used this a lot with the moisturiser Cz it works for dry/sensitive skin without making it too oily or too dry. It was gentle enough & so reasonably price! I hope it gets restocks again Cz I wanted to buy it for quite sometime but always out of stocks
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Singapore,-,First time trying their product and this seems like quite a popular one so was curious and so far so good! Will continue trying so do give it a try too! 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,"Doesnt meet my needs, still a good cleanser!","This cleanser is good if youre looking for something gentle and not specifically targeting any problems in particular. I was gifted this cleanser so that's why Im using something that doesnt address my skincare concerns. I have very acne prone skin with deep hyperpigmentation and while this cleanser is very gentle and effective against removing sweat, dirt and oil, it just isnt enough for my skin issues. For the price, I think this is a fair size, a little goes a long way and I will be using this product up for a while but I wont be repurchasing. There is practically no smell, good or bad, and it doesnt leave my face feeling overly stripped. This would probably be good for someone with very dry and sensitive skin. While this product doesnt work for me and my specific needs, it is still a good cleanser and good value."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,love,"great everyday cleanser, i like the consistency and it isn’t too harsh on sensitive skin!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,The only face wash product I use.,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I’ve never had a product that I can wash my face with and not be beat red. This is the first product I’m not embarrassed to leave my house after using to wash my face. I 10/10 recommend for anyone with sensitive skin. It’s beyond worth the money.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,First Aid Beauty Face Cleanser - 142g,"Gentle on skin, yet tough on oil, grime and makeup."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,My fav cleanser,"Love this no nonsense cleanser, been using it for years! No scent, no residue and it leaves my skin clear."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,Gentle Cleanser,I keep coming back to this cleanser again and again. I have sensitive skin that reacts to anything. This by far is the best face wash that does not cause my skin to freak out. I use it as my second cleanser and it does a great job. Definitely recommend!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Singapore,Face cleanser,Really nice products for First Aid beauty. Recommended to all friends. I love it. Soft my skin and really brighten my skin. Sensitive skin still can use it.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Malaysia,suitable for sensitive skin,Works well with my sensitive skin! Worth the buy. Does not cause any reaction and does not strip off moisture of the skin. A little goes a long way. Will definitely repeat order.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,skin care staple,"I would recommend this to everyone, great for dry skin and sensitive skin folks, will repurchase again and again"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,best face cleanser,"My favorite face cleanser for many years. I keep buying and stocking up on it when their is a sale. I wear makeup everyday and just a small amount washes my face clean. I don’t need to use multiple face cleanser, no wipes or makeup remover before this. Leave my skin clean and smooth."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Australia,I love this,are use this daily and I love it and the only thing that I could say is sometimes it feels a little drying around my nose but in winter I do have a very dry nose and I was hoping because this is for eczema that would help but it hasn’t felt majorly moisturising
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,forever buy!,First aid beauty saved my skin. I’m prone to psoriasis and it’s great for my sensitive skin. I only use this skincare line mixed with Ordinary.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,"Great Product, Terrible Smell!","I recently switched from an acne specific cleanser to this one and so far so great. it's been about 3 weeks, I had a few VERY SMALL breakouts for about 3 days when I switched then it cleared up and my skin is sooooo soft now. I couldn't believe it! It way less than the cleanser I was using and my skin is actually hydrated without breaking out. 
But what is with that smell?! I know it's ""clean"" but other clean products don't smell like they're spoiled. I hope they can change that without changing the formula. Unfortunately it seems I'm getting used to it, but I am self conscious I smell like something rotten."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,Gentle but effective,"Excellent face cleanser! I’m on my third bottle. Gentle yet super effective, it doesn’t leave my face feeling stiff when dry. Removes all makeup and daily sunscreen. 5/5!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,Great for sensitive and acne prone skin!,"This cleanser is suitable for removing everyday impurities and makeup (I use it as a second cleanse). My skin is also very sensitive and acne-prone (cystic acne) so when I use this cleanser, it does not give me any irritation and calms down breakouts. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean and a little goes a long way - seriously! Highly recommend!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Singapore,not bad,Decent product given the price. Would not repurchase again unless during a sale. Bought it as a gift as packaging is very nice. Was a bit drying for skin and didnt have a nice feeling after washing
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,First Aid Beauty Face Cleanser - 56.7g,"I love this, I keep trying different cleansers for my sensitive skin and I go back every time to this one"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,First Aid Beauty Face Cleanser - 56.7g,"Love this one. Best product I have ever used for my super sensitive skin. Infact my aunt who has a severe sun allergy used this once, her skin was visibly so much better without any sort of stinging or burning which she usually got using with the prescribed products for her skin, her skin was so much better after just a wash and she applied the first aid beauty’s cream. She has been using it ever since and doesn’t trust any other product."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Canada,Simple and effective,Simple product to cleanse and remove makeup. A little bit goes a long way. This product also controls oil and breakouts. Scent is not the greatest but it doesn’t bother me much.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS.,"This is the best cleanser I’ve ever used! My skin is so sensitive, as well as being dry and acne-prone. This cleanser doesn’t strip my skin, has improved and almost eliminated breakouts, and takes off all of the residue from the day leaving my skin glowing. I love that it’s not crazy expensive. It’s fragrance free, with a slight oat-like aroma when it foams up. I got multiple compliments on my skin after only a couple days using this product."

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,USA,More Smoothing Rather Than Redness Removing,"I have really bad eczema and also deal with dermatitis. This cleanser works great, I love how it doesn’t strip my skin. I give it 4 stars because I’ve had better cleansers, but this one isn’t bad, it’s really good except I feel like it smooths my skin more than removes redness. Still one of my favorite cleansers and would recommend!"

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Face Cleanser,Australia,Clean nicely ,I like the cleanser. It does not strip my face and clean daily dust and oil of the face. Small one can take around easily. I finished and have a bigger size ready to go. Only issue is clean makeup not good enough

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser Duo,Australia,"It's good, 4 stars.",I prefer the Nuxe Very Rose foam cleanser to this. This Caudalie one is slightly more drying than Very Rose. But still worth trying and excellent value as a twin pack. Lasts so long!

Not a fan of the new packaging though."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser Duo,Singapore,1 purchase. ,"It’s my first time trying the facial wash . It’s cleans very well with very mild scent .

I fell in love with it when I bought a pack of Caudalie with a travel size of this. The only cleanser that's working for me lately. It's either this or Indielee, otherwise my skin would break out from other cleanser. It doesn't work on removing your makeup though. This is perfect for morning or after using makeup remover.
"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser Duo,Philippines,New favorite cleanser,"First time to try cleanser from their line. This one has a foamy texture, ok for sensitive skin and leaves skin clear and smooth after wash. Barely anything to wipe off with toner after wash."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser Duo,Singapore,fav cleanser,"My favourite cleanser of all time! So gentle, doesnt make my skin tight and it smells really good too. Good to stock up as duo set gives u more discount."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Instant Foaming Cleanser Duo,Singapore,Too thin,"I love the idea of auto-foaming, but the lather is too thin. I have to use 3 pumps every time."
"ORIGINS-Tiny Trio Mini Cleansesr, Serum & Moisturizer Trio (Christmas Limited Edition)",Singapore,lovely set ,I love this set. It has everything you want for travelling. And it is all origin’s iconic stuff. Great for sharing with others because you want them to try the stuff. 
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,Singapore,the scent isn’t pleasant,does the job of exfoliating but i think it’s a bit too harsh for everyday use. the scent is what throws me off too it’s a bit too strong for my liking but overall a great product for once a week use! 
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,Singapore,this is love ,I love how it does not strip down the moisture off my face . The micro beads is so comforting and totally cleanse off the small bumps and white heads off my skin. 
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,Canada,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,Favorite exfoliator. Had cleared my skin and leaves me feeling fresh and clean. On to purchasing my next bottle. A little bit goes a long way!
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,Singapore,not impressed ,it started to work at first but somehow your skin gets used to this formula and I find it does not remove debris or control oil very well. your skin gets oily right away after cleansing 
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,Canada,Tried and true,"Let me start with, I also agree with the bottle design being a choice, maybe not the best choice.

Outside of that, this product, for me, truly changed or at least maintained my skin. It's been the one product that traverses the years with me while the rest of my skincare keeps changing. I suffered from a lot of acne growing up to the point of Accutane. This gave me pretty even skin with small pimples here and there that show up at the most importune time like most people. 

So, all of this led me to start exploring skincare and I found this product really maintains my skin the best. I notice a difference when I use it versus when I don't. I personally use it in the shower, which makes it easier to rinse off. Do note, it leaves my skin a little dry, like most exfoliants, which is why we use toner, serum, and moisturizer, but most importantly it leaves it smooth. Whenever I have a pimple that shows up outta nowhere, this definitely helps to reduce the redness and make the disappearance of said pimple much faster.

This might not be for everyone, as the skincare experience is to each their own, but I truly, personally, can't recommend this product enough."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,Canada,Clogged my skin,Not happy at all with this product. I was breaking out badly after using for a few months. Didn’t think it had anything to do with the face wash. After stopped using this my face cleared up. Oh and also terrible packaging as the thick face wash gets so clogged in the spout.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,Singapore,exfoliating indeed,"this item surprised me. i wanted an exfoliating face wash and that is exactly what it delivers. doesn't strip all the oils or rub into the skin the wrong way, but rather it feels like im using a gentle loofah on my face. love it. "
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,Canada,Worked great on my dry skin,Absolutely love this! Felt a difference in my dry skin after just a couple of days!
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,Canada,Disappointing and frustrating…,"I bought this to use occasionally, as my skin needs a little extra exfoliation from time to time, beyond what my chemical exfoliants can handle. It does smooth my skin out well but, unfortunately, every time I use it I end up breaking out a couple days later. The exfoliating beads(?) are so small that they get into my pores and no amount of rinsing will get them out. I end up with tiny pimples all over my face, in places I never break out naturally. And as others have said, the bottle design makes it difficult to dispense the product, so the whole experience has been frustrating."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,"not great for dry, sensitive skin",My skin is very dry and sensitive and this dried me out way too much.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,Canada,Amazing scrub. Bad bottle design!!,Love this facial scrub!! Bottle is absolutely stupid!!!!! Hard to get out! :(
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,Canada,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,Love this. My husband has sensitive skin but loves exfoliating daily for his acne and dry skin and this works but is also gentle enough for daily use
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,Canada,"Great product, terrible bottle lid.","Lovely product! Smells citrusy, but not to heavily. Scrubs well & good amount of foam. Works well. 
The letdown here, and why I didn’t give five stars, is the bottle. The product is concentrated and therefore thick - and the pop cap gets clogged easily and often. A pump would be MUCH better."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,one cap away from 5 stars,"I love this face wash, my only complaint is the cap. It’s so hard to get out. My skin always feels really great afterwards!"
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Works really good,Its a really good exfoliater. Nice price too. It doesn't take the place of my favorite but its next to the best.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,boomerang,"I got an 8 fl oz bottle of this for $15  a while back. its become my go2 exfoliator and I recommended keeping a bottle in your shower. my current, well-used bottle, is nestled upon my toliet tank...ready 4 heavy lifting at a moments notice, yea!"
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,This paired with the purity face wash is pure perfection. I love scrubbing my face and neck with this wonderful product.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,"The hard plastic makes it a struggle to come out of the bottle.  I don’t want to work that hard and it seems the product doesn’t want to work that hard either.  Does not exfoliate much.  It time to move away for the hard plastic Philosophy it 2021! 

Also, after the struggle of getting the product out some always stay in the cap and dries make it even more difficult."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,"Excellent product, this is a staple in my skincare routine! Only recommended to use a physical exfoliant twice a week, and this is an excellent one to use. A little pricey, but a little goes a long way and if only using it twice a week, will last a long time ! Highly recommend."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,Great product. I use it once weekly and it does the trick!
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Best Exfoliating Face Wash,"I have been using this product for 3 years and have repurchased as my daily exfoliating face wash that I use once a day.  When wearing make up, you can apply once and everything will be washed off, leaving your skin feeling squeaky clean.  It doesn't dry out my skin or irritate my sensitive skin.  I have purchased this product multiple times and will continue to use this product because of how clean my skin feels, how non-irritating the exfoliation is, and the pleasant scent (light citrus).  Highly recommend!"
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Disappointing!,Disappointing product and horrible packaging.  The only thing I like about this wash is the scent.  The product is grainy so it's almost impossible to get out the tiny hole -- you will have to unscrew the top and squeeze it out and then too much comes out.  I end up mixing it with Cetaphil because this stuff leaves a film on my face.  Worst cleanser I have ever used.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Too weak of an exfoliator,"Very, very, very light exfoliation. Only for the super sensitive. I don't think they should call this an exfoliating facial wash."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,"Tried this product out for about 2 weeks and it made my face break out even more. I've never had many issues with face scrubs or cleansers, but something in this one made my face worse. After I stopped using it my face went back to normal."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,I wear a full face of makeup every day. I use this a couple times a week and it seems to get all the excess gunk out of my face. I love it. I have sensitive skin and haven’t had an issue.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Amazing product with poor packaging,"This is my go-to exfoliating face wash, but the packaging is a huge downfall. Great, gentle exfoliation that's easy on the skin while getting the job done. However the 16oz bottle is impossible to get product from!"
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,My favorite for years!,"I’ve been using this exfoliator for years. I have tried other brands and always come back to this. Lasts forever, too! You only need a little bit of product to get a good scrub going."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,"Wish I knew about this sooner, I have tried way too many exfoliating products and this is the one. Gentle, does the right amount of work and leaves face clean without a trace.

Only complaints are how hard it is to get product from this bottle design."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Like,I like this. This does what it claims. The only complaint is that this package is hard to use....
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,"The product itself it great. The packaging, not so much. It’s hard to squeeze out of the pop up top and when you unscrew the lid it’s hard to control the amount that comes out and is wasteful. Especially in the shower with wet/soapy hands trying to screw the lid back on so water doesn’t get inside."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Good Stuff,"This stuff is great! It works to get all the dry, peeling skin off the face, neck and chest skin. It does not make your skin break out! My skin is very sensitive due to Psoriatic Arthritis. Very gentle, yet thorough."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,"Lived this product , I have a sensitive and dry skin , this was not too harsh on my face like other ones I tried . I don’t use this as face wash instead as a scrub once in every 3 days and I absolutely love it ."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,My skin did not feel smoother after using this product. Did nothing for my acne.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,good scrub..even better if on sale,this is a good scrub and does the job. i took one star off as i would have liked to be more moisturizing.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Smooth and clean,"My skin feels so smooth and clean after using this. My acne has also died down, as an added bonus!"
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,The exfoliating beads aren’t as harsh as many exfoliating face cleaners. It does dry my skin a little bit though
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,"I love love LOVE philosophy, from their body care to skin care the company know its products! I have been using the microdelivery exfoliating face wash for about 3 years now and it has done wonders for my skin! It exfoliates without leaving small scratches or tearing my skin and it is also a cleanser which have saved me a lot of time, I would 100% recommend picking this up"
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,"Next best thing compared to Clinique exfoliating scrub, although this one does win best smell."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,"I've been using this face wash for about a month, and while it feels great to use, and smells nice, as someone with skin prone to dryness, my skin gets a little overly dry using this every day, even when my other products are moisturizing. Still a great wash, I'll use it maybe 2 times a week, and use a non-exfoliating wash the other days. I wanted to be able to use it every day, but my skin had other plans."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,"Gentle enough for daily use if you’re gentle, too","This is a pretty gentle scrub, especially if your face is pre-dampened and you use light pressure when circulating the scrub around your face. I have skin that loves to go bright red when I touch or scratch it, so I like the fact this just brings a little glow and I can use it daily. I use it in the evenings instead, and apply my serum and moisturizer so it can go to work while I sleep. It’s early days yet, so I can’t attest to its effectiveness in reducing pore size (a tall ask of any product, really) or fine lines. I’m watching mine carefully, so I imagine I’ll adjust this review if something dramatic happens."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,I really wanted to love this,"I love scrub face washes but with this it feels like little shards of glass on your face, it scared me when I first used it because I thought my face was going to be scratched all up. If you use this be VERY careful cause it could cause some damage."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,new favorite skincare product. after less than a week my texture has gone down greatly and my skin feels so soft and young.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,This is amazingggggg stuff. I have very oily skin and a few bumps on my forehead that I’ve been wanting to get rid of. This has helped me so much with keeping my oily face at bay and I have noticed my skin is much smoother. My face is not as sensitive so I use this product day and night. I love the citrus smell but I do see what people mean about the bottle being horrible. Trying to squeeze some ish out while cleaning your face should not be a chore lol. Anyways I had to repurchase this in a bigger size despite the crappy bottle because it’s THAT good.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Very nice,I love this stub . It leaves your face nice and soft and clean.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,LOVE,I absolutely love this face wash. It makes your skin feel super soft and clean. I use it every other day.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy Convert,"I was a diehard Murad customer until I got this wash for my mom, and had to try it for myself too. It feels AMAZING and comes out in a perfect amount. My skin felt great after, definitely converting!!"
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,"I love this product and use daily. My biggest complaint is the bigger bottle is super hard and does not squeeze, it is hard to get the stuff out. I buy the 2 oz because they are easier to use. I was surprised just now to see the price almost doubled! I love the product but have to seriously consider purchasing again."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Sensitive Skin & Acne Prone,"This is my FIRST REVIEW EVER! I love to read comments for reviews to decided if I should purchase an item. I was praying this would work for me after reading other reviews. The first use was harsh. I waited a few days and starting using again. This product really WORKS. I use every morning and I saw results after one week. I will not use anything else. I have a habit of trying different products and wasting money. I have extremely sensitive skin and nothing seems to work. I love this. I am buying the bigger bottle! I also use the Supergoop moisturizer sunscreen best moisturizer, do not have any breakouts at all. Thank you Sephora!"
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,I love this stuff! It’s general enough to use every morning and it has a light citrus clean scent. The best way to describe it is a super fine sand exfoliate and it’s just amazing
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Fabulous for dry skin,I suffer from super dry skin and flaking. This has been a life saver. I have sensitive skin as well and it didn't irritate my face.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Very Gentle,This facial wash positively surprised me because the microgranules were very gentle. Drugstore washes are typically pretty rough on the skin which wasn't the case with this wash. Another great thing about this wash is that you literally need just a pea-size amount to wash the whole face!
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Magical face scrub! Ridiculously horrible bottle.,"Absolutely magical product! I will never use anything else now! I have somewhat sensitive skin and always struggle with redness. BUT I also always struggle with clogged pores. For a long time I thought it was acne, now I really it was just breakouts due to easily clogged pores. THIS STUFF IS MAGIC! It completely cleans out my pores and makes my skin feel so clean and soft, and it somehow manages this without irritating my skin! I've never met an exfoliating face wash that I can actually use daily until this one! Magic I tell you!!
The only reason I knocked off a star is because the bottle is a joke. It's a thick scrub but for some reason these people thought it made sense to put it in a hard plastic bottle. It's basically a workout every day in the shower trying to squeeze some out. 5-star product, 0-star packaging. I'll change my review to 5 stars in a heartbeat if you guys switch to a squeeze bottle. Until then I guess I need to find my own squeeze bottle and transfer the scrub to that."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,I love this exfoliator! My skin always feels so soft and smooth after I use it. The bottle says you can use it everyday but I only use it every other day. Definitely will repurchase this but the large bottle lasts forever
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,"Nice and gentle but exfoliating, smells pleasant, and does the job. Did not irritate or over exfoliate my skin. I enjoyed it. The bottle once it starts to get closer to empty can be difficult to get product out."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,"Good product, horrible bottle",I love the product — it exfoliates nicely without irritating my skin. But the container is god awful! I feel like I'm going to rip a tendon every time I try to squeeze out what's inside.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,The exfoliation was a bit harsh for me. The bottle is made of a hard plastic material. It makes it impossible to squeeze. I didn’t see enough benefits to keep using this or enough to transfer the product into a better squeezable bottle.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Love it! Great exfoliator,"My skin always feels fresh after using this (usually every Monday and Friday) and I love it. There is a faint citrus scent, but it hasn't irritated my skin at all. The downfall? The amount of effort it takes to squeeze the product out is ridiculous! The bottle is so thick that it takes a small workout to get the product out."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,"I’ve been using this and their Purity facial cleanser for over two years, and I love them...but why did the mini price jump from eight to thirteen dollars a few 
weeks ago??"
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,love this!,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT. it is such a good exfoliant, it cleared most of my acne. My roommates use it now to because its so amazing."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Oh boy!,"I have dealt with whiteheads for so long and normally my approaches to exfoliating have been a little harsh which leave my skin dry, swollen or feeling somewhat bruised. And In about 2 days my whiteheads especially around my temples, cheeks and chin are visible again. But this product has been a much needed change for me!! I’m so excited I chose to try it after reading countless reviews. It’s so worth it. It’s gentle and effective. In the first week after 2 uses I have not seen my any whiteheads!! It does not dry out my skin too. Lool I have spent an unusual amount of time just starring at the improvement on my face."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,love love love,I can’t say enough good things about this product! I use it three times a week and my face has never looked better. I’m on my second one and I will continue to use this product. No weird smells either.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,I'll exfoliate my face maybe twice a week with this just because i feel like this works so well and it leaves my face so fresh for a few days
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Really good,It smells good and leaves skin soft from the first use. I use it daily and haven’t found it harsh on my skin-though it’s sensitive. Only the bottle isn’t the best as it disperses the gel with difficulty.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,amazing gentle exfoliater,Love this exfoliating cleanser! It is such a gentle cleanser and I use it in the morning before the moisturizer and makeup.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,No positive results,"I’m in my 30’s and have had clear skin up until the last few years. I feel like I’ve tried every product on the market and had high hopes reading the reviews, but it’s a no. The formula is nice, but it hasn’t done anything for my skin, if anything my skin has broken out terribly, the worst it’s ever been. I understand your skin purges when you try a new product so I’ve been patient, times up! I’ll try and return once the store opens up."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Nothing Special,"I gave it to my brother who requires little to no skin care. It's advertised to use everyday, but doesn't take off makeup. I also have acne prone skin, so nothing in here to aid that."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,It's a non from me dawg!!,I wanted to like this so bad but I am super unimpressed. First of all the product is so thick that it is impossible to squeeze out of the bottle. You have to completely remove the cap to get any of it out. It feels like a good exfoliant and it foams nicely but it leaves my skin with small white or reddish bumps after each use so I won't be using this again.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,I've been using this product for about a year and I love it! I use this in the shower and it really gets my face clean. My face feels soft and smooth and is not irritating to my sensitive skin.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Great exfoliator,This product is great for exfoliating. I used it with my Clarisonic and it was great. I have very sensitive skin so my skin did turn a little red. I use every other day.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Alright,It smells really nice and when you use it you can really feel it exfoliating but it did scratch my check so you kind of have to be careful using it
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,best exfoliating wash ever,"Exfoliates are super super tiny....the only thing able to get my dry, stubborn skin to exfoliate! Finally my skin can breathe!!!"
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,"First, let me say that I have very sensitive and acne prone skin. This facial wash is excellent at keeping my face free of black and white heads. This wash is a must have.
Only thing I don't like is how hard the bottle is, making it hard to get the product out."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,The perfect exfoliator,"WOW if your skin needs a refresh and that perfect just got a facial glow, then this should be your secret weapon!!!"
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Great exfoliating wash,Love this. Great exfoliating for my sensitive skin. Did not dry my skin. Feels great on my skin.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Awesome but strong,"I like using this cleanser once a week. I noticed a difference in how smooth my skin feels. I don’t use it daily because my skin develops dry patches because it’s too strong for me. I did like how much better my skin looks just using it minimally and it does make my face feel really clean afterwards. I also like that it’s a nice consistency not watery or goooy, and there is no strong smell."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,"Great product, silly bottle.","Great product! This works great and does what it says it does. One small thing though - the bottle is extremely hard, and you have to squeeze it out to dispense the product. I don't have any dexterity issues in my hand, and it is still extremely difficult to get out. I know that's such a strange thing to write in a review, but really, it's not designed well! If you have any issues with your hands, don't buy this."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,"this smells so fresh! i really like it. simple and clean. makes my skin feel pretty good, definitely recommend :)"
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,"Gentle, doesn't irritate, but WORKS","I have struggled with dry/sensitive skin that is prone to redness my whole life. I have mild eczema, and I have struggled for years to find an exfoliating wash that doesn't leave me extra dry or red. This is the only one I have consistently repurchased. The exfoliating beads are small and delicate, but there are tons of them. You can't directly see them in the product because they are so fine, but you really feel them working. The base of the product is also great, it is similar to Cetaphil or CeraVe gentle face washes, so the product exfoliates but does not over dry or strip the skin. It is very light, with minimal scent. I can even use this product in the fall and winter when my skin is at its most dry and red. I've recommended this product to tons of friends, and they all thank me for it."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,Love! Doesnt burn your eyes or face. Gentle yet effective
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,A Staple,"If you've never used this, your life is about to be changed. To me, this is the be all end all exfoliating cleanser. My skin never feels as smooth as it does after I use this cleanser. It also has a nice citrus smell. Have never found a better exfoliator."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Used to be perfect,"I used this product for years and it was fabulous. Then I received the bottle with the sticker 'New Formula'! It is impossible to squeeze out of the bottle and is an awful mucus-like consistency. Few exfoliating beads. It will be my last purchase of this product. Too bad, because I used to love it."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Love this lighter version of the peel,"I decided to splurge on this cleanser because I liked Philosophy's Microdelivery Peel. This facial wash is like the lighter version of the peel. I love the microbeads and how smooth it makes my skin feel. I have oily skin that's not very sensitive so it works well for me. It beats all the drug-store brands I've used. If you have sensitive skin, this might not be for you as the microbeads are a little rough on the skin."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,"This is my favorite skin care product. It makes my face so smooth, and a bottle lasts forever."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Shocked how well it worked,"I had a sample of this that I put off using, and I’m so sorry I waited. My face has never felt so soft, yet clean."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,refreshing scrub,facial wash smells wonderful and works great to get rid of dead skin.. this was a sample that I will be purchasing when I run out
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Gentle yet effective,This face wash is very effective at sloughing off all the nasties yet leaves your skin incredibly soft and smooth.  The fragrance is uplifting and I find it very soothing to my soul.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,"Good product, bad packaging.",The product is too thick for this bottle. The bottle is too rigid to squeeze and the product is very difficult to get out. A big hassle to use.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,"I always come back to this face wash. Such a good little scrub, whenever you need a little extra exfoliation."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Travel size exfoliation,Very effective physical exfoliator - I keep it in my travel cosmetics bag and it’s lasted for ages! Will definitely buy again.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,eh,Just okay for me:(. I had high hopes with all the good reviews. Not necessarily bad but has shown no real sign of improvement with my skin. Friendly to my dry skin for the most part. Not very good at removing my light daily face makeup but gentle when removing my eye makeup.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,It does a fine job I suppose. Haven't really seen a difference in my skin.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Great for sensitive skin!,"Because I have sensitive, reactive skin, I steered clear of exfoliation. But, I also have dry skin which NEEDS exfoliation. It's been a dilemma. That is until I tried Philosophy's Microdelivery Exfoliating Face Wash! I love this product! It exfoliates brilliantly without drying or irritating my skin. And, it has a charming citrus smell."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Great product when used correctly!,I don’t recommend using this product more than once or twice a week. I started out using this one everyday and I broke out really bad. Overall it’s a great product and has a nice scent.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Great Exfoliator,I got a mini size which is great for trips bc I usually use a similar brush to wash my face. But a quick warning- dont use this cleanser alone on a facial brush! It works well if you use a foaming cleanser and just a drop of the exfoliating cleanser in the center of the brush which I do every few days. Its great for when I dont take my brush with me and a little goes a long way so it lasts! But using it alone on the brush totally hurt my face and in one place even broke the skin.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,"great product, packaging needs improvement. the bottle it comes in makes it difficult to squeeze the product out. if you have arthritis in your fingers you might want to transfer the product in a softer bottle that's easier to squeeze."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Terrible packaging,I like the product but the bottle is such hard plastic it is virtually impossible to squeeze and get it out. I have not been very happy with recent philosophy packaging. The lotion I just got had a broken pump so I had to get another bottle sent.  I don't know how anyone gets the product out of the bottle
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Philosophy The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash - 240ml,great scrub for exfoliation. leaves my skin super soft and smooth. felt extra clean after. very good price.
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Great exfoliate,I love it! My face feels amazing after I use it and it doesn’t feel too harsh. Will buy again
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,TRUE LOVE,"LOVE LOVE LOVE! Have been using this almost daily for several weeks now and i can totally see a difference. Overall my skin is doing great, texture and pigmentation have greatly improved. No breakouts! Will definitely re-purchase."
PHILOSOPHY-The Microdelivery Exfoliating Facial Wash,USA,Love this scub,"I use this every other day to deep clean my face. It's gentle, and the newer suspension means that the scrub part is more evenly distributed in the bottle. I've used this product for years and am very happy with the results."
SHU UEMURA-Blanc:Chroma Lightening & Polishing Cleansing Oil,Philippines,Great cleanser for travelling,This is a great choice for travelling. It's size fits perfectly in my groom kit and the product gets the job done! I love Shu's cleanser line and this is the 3rd variety that I've tried. I like how light it is on my face and I love the smell too!
SHU UEMURA-Blanc:Chroma Lightening & Polishing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Best cleansing oil,Love the smell! Clean makeup well! 
SHU UEMURA-Blanc:Chroma Lightening & Polishing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,my favourite cleansing oil,The best cleansing oil that I have ever tried. It really works so well. The texture is very thin and there is a very light scent which is great as I am sensitive to scents.
SHU UEMURA-Blanc:Chroma Lightening & Polishing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,HG,"the only cleansing oil I use. its light, not oily, does not leave a residue. cleans all makeup even waterproof mascara. does not sting the eyes. I don't even need to double cleanse. tried other brands but this is the one I always come back to. the pink one is also nice. "
SHU UEMURA-Blanc:Chroma Lightening & Polishing Cleansing Oil,Philippines,gift idea,"gifted this to a friend recently, she enjoys using it, got no complaints from her so I guess all is well and product does what it’s supposed to. Product was also delivered on time. Thank you for the good packaging as well. "
SHU UEMURA-Blanc:Chroma Lightening & Polishing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Cleansing Oil,Chroma lightening and Polishing Cleansing Oil can remove make up easily. Re purchase many time on this item. The smile is good. Definitely will re purchase again.
SHU UEMURA-Blanc:Chroma Lightening & Polishing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,better than green bottle ,"I tried green, pink and this purple bottle. I still prefer pink bottle for the refreshing feel and effect. This purple bottle texture is lighter than the green bottle but does not make my skin feel as clean as the pink bottle. Average and recommend for dry to normal skin. "
SHU UEMURA-Blanc:Chroma Lightening & Polishing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Great cleansing oil,"This cleansing oil cleanses my makeup off easily without having to rub much. Cleansing power is good yet non drying. 
The travel sized bottle also makes it very convenient to bring along for trips."
SHU UEMURA-Blanc:Chroma Lightening & Polishing Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Best cleansing oil,This facial cleansing oil is great to remove impurities on my face when washing up
LAB SERIES-Oil Control Clay Cleanser + Mask,Singapore,excellent mask,My husband uses this as a mask once a week and his skin always looks hydrated and fabulous afterwards. definitely add to your regular skin routine. he loves the rest of the lab series range also
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,good ,price is expensive but this brand is known for its japanese skin care ingredients inside. waiting for promotions to try out other products that eyeing on
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Nice but..,"I use my Foreo Luna religiously and unfortunately I will never use this face wash with my Luna. However it’s a staple in my travel bag and I love how it makes your skin refreshed and clean without being too abrasive. Problem is I don’t travel much, and a small tube is enough to last for a few holidays across a year, so for the price, I wouldn’t recommend it if you use the Foreo Luna as well."
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,brightens your skin well,"this really does its job by making my skin more smooth and ‘clean’ afterwards. When you rub it on your skin, you can really feel the dead skin cells go away. However, it is hard to wash off and i dont think its suitable for sensitive skin"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,ride or die cleanser,"Favourite cleanser forever. I use this every night after oil cleanser. This has the best effect on my skin. Leaves the skin feeling cleansed, but not drying, no tightness. Just clean and fresh skin!"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,My boyfriend loves this,"I personally don’t like abrasive/rough products on my face, but my boyfriend absolutely swears by this. And this is a lot coming from someone as low-maintenance and thrift as him. We both wish the bigger size (limited edition) were still available as it’s cheaper per ml during sales period and more economical since it’s twice the normal size and lasts twice as long, but alas, it’s not available anymore. Hope the 300ml-size one comes back soon"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,mm,"Nice product! Cleans my combination acne prone 
skin perfectly without being harsh. Neither leaves my skin oily nor dry. Smells good too! Will surely repurchase "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,not drying gentle scrub,i had used this since 3 years back. i have a dry skin ans sensative was scared to attempt scrub with microbeans. as usually it is so drying. i use this alternate days. it not drying gently exfloliate. i tried not to used this when i had retinol overnight its might be to drying the next day
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,drying,"Using this for awhile made my skin drier and drier
unknowingly. If your skin is already dry, don't
recommend this. Otherwise it's a really normal
cleanser. My t-zone starts to get oily 2-3 hours after
wash
I agree"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,drying,"Using this for awhile made my skin drier and drier unknowingly. If your skin is already dry, don’t recommend this. Otherwise it’s a really normal cleanser. My t-zone starts to get oily 2-3 hours after wash "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,light for deep cleanse,It’s not too heavy so suitable for sensitive skin. The scrub is very soft. Smells nice. Even tho this is a light cleanse but it cleanse deeply. My face feel softer after I washed.
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,love this ,This works well on my combination skin. It gives a deep cleanse to get off my makeup and does not leave my face feeling tight and stripped afterwards like some other cleansers. I also love the new pouch as this is more convenient and easy to use than the original bottle. 
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,love it,Love it so much that I decided to buy the bigger bottle. My face feels soft and smooth after each use. Did not dries up my face. Does not feels tight too even if I use it daily in the evening. Really love this cleanser. 
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,flawless,My 2nd tube. It's pricey though but i don't mind. My face looks even nicer than before! It does control my oily skin and acne. I noticed my skin stopped produce excessive oil and acne. It feels so goooood after washing my face with this cleaser. It gives a smooth and soft skin texture after using it. 
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Good cleanser ,"This product does the job, it gives a good, satisfying scrub. Great for my oily skin."
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,favourite cleanser,"my go to cleanser! love how the exfoliating beads feel, is not rough on my skin and leaves skin feeling fresh! def will repurchase again when empty :)"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,new favourite cleanser ,"i'm not a big fan of exfoliating cleansers because some can be really harsh on the skin and ever since i've noticed my skin going from just oily acne prone to sensitive combination skin, my entire skincare routine has been an absolute mess because of how unpredictable it has been since the start of covid and maskne. i saw somewhere recently that an influencer mentioned that tatcha skincare has saved her skin even though the price range is on the high end so i decided to take that jump and i'm honestly glad that i did. this is a gentle exfoliating cleanser that i fell inlove with even though it's only been like 3 days. i guess it's safe to say that i have found my new favourite skincare line. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Meh😕,"I was about to rate this product 3 ⭐️ but decided on a 2 because I can’t get the cap out. Have been screwing on and off the whole cap and squeezing out the product from the bottle🤦🏻‍♀️ Anyway, product is a pass because I expect it to wow me with this price tag. Cleansing gel is so so with little quantity of beads each use which I like (less abrasive) but I can find better cleansers out there with a much affordable price tag."
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,gift again.,"Seriously hahaha! I am gifting cleansers to people around me. This one is for my acne prone brother. He kept laughing at the letter from Tatcha upon unboxing this item. Jokes aside, this bottle can go a long way. They have got this in a tube form. Go for it! Life is easier that way. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,best face wash ,Absolutely adored this face wash ♥️ I developed sensitive skin from the constant mask wearing plus daily stress so had pimples on my face. Used this and it definitely helped to calm my skin. The improvement is very noticeable. Will be using this as my permanent face wash
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,The only cleanser that u ever need!,"Since using the cleanser,my skin looks so much better. No break outs due to the cleanser so far. As I have sensitive skin,I'm very careful in choosing products on my skin. I recommend Tatcha to those with oily + combi skin. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,one of the best cleAnser,"Despite the expensive price, i really love this cleanser from the very beginning. Was using the sample and bought a full size on sale. I use it if i wear makeup as my second cleanse. It work great and i will continue using it."
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,Love it,"Love this deep cleanse! I have combination skin, this product can clean blackhead out of my nose and leave my skin soft after cleansing."
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Love the new packaging ,"My husband uses this for his oily, acne prone skin and he seems to love it. He uses this at night time and the Claudalie Vinopure line. It is definitely exfoliating, it has some of those little granules in the formula. It’s a little too much for my sensitive skin, also because fragrance/parfum is high up on the ingredients list. Then new packaging is a great improvement! It’s effective for more intensive oily skin needs. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Deep Cleanser,This product cleanses your make up and daily purities. It does not leave your skin dry and pores are smaller and skin is smoother. Highly recommended! 
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Nice but expensive,"My husband uses this for his oily, acne prone skin and he seems to love it. He uses this at night time and the Claudalie Vinopure line. It is definitely exfoliating, it has some of those little granules in the formula. It’s a little too much for my sensitive skin, also because fragrance/parfum is high up on the ingredients list. It is a great bottle to keep in the shower, and his skin likes it. So it’s effective for more intensive skin needs. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,expensive for an average product,the price point is set way too high for this product! the texture is gel but with micro beads inside that sometimes feel too abrasive for daily use. leaves the skin feeling dry sometimes too. 
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,holy grail!!,"Multiple purchase. I’ve tried this and tatcha rice wash and much prefer this! Very gently exfoliating, cleanses without stripping my skin. I love it! "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,deep cleanser!,"When I saw all the reviews about it I just cant wait to try it out ! And they were not wrong, after using it my face feels so smooth and clean. I don’t regret on buying this one! I love it!"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,wonderful pair with the water cream,"I got this to pair with my water cream. The formula is gentle yet it exfoliates and scrubs well without irritating my skin. I have sensitive skin and so far, my skin is responding well to this wash. 
Really like the Tatcha range!"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore, Worth it!,"One of my favourite to reach out to when I need a good clean and scrub. It's not too harsh on the skin and leaves it feeling ultra skin. Half star docked for the squeeze dispensing, which is not smart. It's difficult to control how much to dispense and many a times I squeeze (and waste) too much. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,great product,"Smells great and the microbeads are gentle on the skin. Leaves my face feeling fresh and clean without stripping moisture. Though abit pricey for a facewash, I may repurchase in the future
"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,tatcha deep cleanse,"This deeply cleanse my skin without drying it out. Unlike other products where it leaves my skin super tight after washing. Its pricey but a good product to invest in
"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,worth it,"A great cleanser. It’s not outstanding but it’s enjoyable to use and I’d happily purchase it again. It’s gentle, removes impurities and dirt, is soft and hydrating, and has improved my skin’s clarity. It’s not helped my skin texture or pores but I’m still happy with the results."
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,soft exfoliating ,"I have combonitation ans sensetive skin. I am sensative mostly at my cheek and super oily at tzone. This works really well. I love how soft the exfoliation is. You can use this as a double wash after heavy makeup on. It has a scent, if you dont like scent this might not be for you. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,A gift,"a birthday gift for my sister and she loves it! Feels super clean after using it.. makeup residue was removed totally. Might get one for myself too!! 
"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,cleanses but I prefer tatcha’s rice wash cleanser,"Bought this cleanser as part of the combination-oily skin care range by tatcha. 
Things I like - cleanses reasonably well, skin doesn’t feel too dry after cleansing, fragrance not too strong. 
Things that I don’t like - bottle design not the best (difficult to control the amount squeezed out. Unlike the rice wash cleanser, my skin didn’t feel any different. 
Would probably give this a miss "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,Best facial scrub ever,Felt so so clean after using this. The smell owh my god! Not sure if you like it but it does for me. And no residue left on the skin. Gonna repurchase soon 
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,Gentle and smells great,Love this gentle scrub because it is not harsh on the skin and it smells divine! Would definitely repurchase the bigger size after I run out. Also love how beautiful the bottle and it’s colour looks like on my bathroom counter.
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,mahal namatey,Its very good but very expesive also.. it dont make my skin dry after washing my face even in the aircond.. will def repurchase it and make it my forever cleanser
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,I tried Tatcha deep cleanse!,"I use Tatcha deep cleanse 2x a day. this is my 2nd purchased. it's gentle yet effective. if you don't want headache, go for this one. Minus one star as it's price isn't the most affordable price (for some people) from my opinion. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Ms,The Deep Cleanse is my first try with Tatcha. I love the packing design. Very comfortable and clean feel after used. Highly recommended for those looking face wash. 
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,Best Deep Cleanse,"Really love the instant result this cleanser gives, with just one wash, my face is a tad bit brighter, it looks cleaner. This cleanser is not rough, which is why its called gentle. But the price point is on the high side, will not repurchase."
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Not Too Sure ,Skin felt soft and clean after using it but every time it follows up with 1 or 2 pimple popping out. Same for my hubby who tried using this Tacha The Deep Cleanse.
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,good for removal,This product is really good for deep cleanse and removing heavy make up. Skin doesn’t feel too dry after wash so it’s really good and skin still feels coeansed and rejuvenised
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,pretty good ,"It’s an expensive product but a little goes a long way and this has lasted me quite one time. It’s suitable for my sensitive skin, doesn’t leave my face with an overly dry feeling yet does a good job of deep cleansing. Would recommend!"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,5 star product ,"From now on my fav cleanser ever!!! Absolutely worth it’s money!!! My skin was so glowing, soft and shiny after first usage! Cannot believe that I finally found the cleanser that meets all my expectations!!! Plz, don’t hesitate and try it! And you won’t regret about! "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,My go to face cleanser,"Love this product. Leaves the skin feeling cleansed throughout, but doesn't dry the skin out too much. Addition of a little peeling is always welcome. The only annoying part is the packaging as you have to be patient and careful when getting the product out of the bottle."
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,Tatcha The Deep Cleanse,Tatcha The Deep Cleanse. It really cleanse my skin without stripping my skin. I feel very clean once I wash off. Highly recommend this product especially for oily skin.
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,NICE PRODUCT,"It is a beautiful product, cleanses the face nicely, smells nice and lighyly exfoliates. I would say though,this is not the best one I have ever used."
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,great gentle exfoliator,I love everything about this product. It cleans all impurities effectively yet gentle to be used daily. The smell is amazing too! can't wait to try other tatcha products
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Skin never felt so hydrated after cleansing ,"I have been using this cleanser for 2 years and besides Kose's White Washing Cream cleanser, this is the only cleanser that I keep going back to. 

I alternate both cleansers every two days and my oily skin has been back to slightly more normal. 

It feels extremely gentle and hydrating after cleansing, despite its deep cleansing properties. it's actually strong enough to remove my makeup (foundation, lipstick, eyeliner and mascara). 

Not sure about others, but I find the herbal scent from the cleanser very therapeutic ❤️ 

"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,loveeeeeee,"I love this as a before bedtime routine. Cleans away all the muck from the evening, leaving my skin oh so soft! Ive got combination skin with really oily tzone and this takes care of that. Helps reducing acne and scarring too. Purchased months bfr my wedding as a prep and lovedddddd the way my skin turned out"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,good but expensive,"I think this deep cleansing formula works well, feel the pores cleaner, but still, it's too pricy for a cleanser to use every day. Creamy, moisturizing and effective nonetheless"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Ms,"My favourite cleanser. Have never had trouble removing any makeup with it -- doesn't irritate eyes. Leaves my skin really clean, not stripped. It is the best. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,tatcha the deep cleanse - wow!,"gentle exfoliation.... feels luxurious during application, and after washing off it leaves your skin smooth and supple... need to get past the scent though..."
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,LOVE IT!,Now I am a Tatcha fan!!!! The results are felt in the first use and visible in a week's time. I have massively acne prone skin and this was a very good find. I loved how it makes my face less oily/shiny throughout the day. my breakouts have reduced and so has the inflammation. This is a must buy!
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,Great cleanser ,"Great cleanser with minimal scent to it but I must say it finishes verg quickly- less than a month for me as the tip doesnt allow us to control the outlet of the cleanser. With that price, probably wont repurchase again "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Love it! ,"Absolutely love the cleanser, its gentle but your skin feel so soft after. It is pricey but I think since its a deep cleanse, you only need to use it once a week. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,For those who love clean skin without that tight/dry feeling.,"The SMELL of this cleanser is divine and is enough for me to want to keep using it. It's a pleasant yuzu-y/citrus-y scent that isn't too overpowering! Would love if all my skincare smelled like this.

I always come back to this cleanser, especially when I get complacent and try random skincare samples that agitate my skin and cause breakouts. It's not only great at clearing up my skin, but also to reset the skin barrier (I feel). "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,the bits inside are too big ,"I don’t like the packaging I can see I will have a lot of problems getting all the product out in future. Then bits inside are also too rough for me. Instructions are to avoid the eyes area which is extra work for me because I like to double cleanse with my cleanser to remove make up. The only thing I like about this is that it does not strip my face after use unlike other exfoliating cleansers. 
I will continue using this product because of the price but will not re purchase.     "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Tatcha deep cleanse,"This cleanser did serve its purpose of cleaning. It's infused with soft particles that exfoliate and remove dead cells. However, I find myself not a fan of Tatcha products. After cleansing, I don't get the clean but moisturised feel unlike some other brands. Don't quite like the fragrance in Tatcha products too. I don't understand why there are so many good reviews when it's so ordinary to me."
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Not for dry skin /:,"While it didn’t dry my skin any further, I need something more moisturising for my dry skin. Typically, products should absorb super nicely after the use of any exfoliating product but that didn’t happen for me. I’m a huge fan of Tatcha’s products so this was disappointing."
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,worth the buy,"this cleanser even gently washes up my make up with the most gentle way and no matter how thick my make up is, it still washes off very clean. i love it."
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,love it,I have ultra oily skin and loves to have squeaky clean skin after washing my face. This doesn't break me out and leaves me feeling oh so clean. Thumbs up
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,I love this,"I bought the deluxe size of this product before I purchased the full sized version. This is a miracle in a bottle for me, it leaves my skin feeling clean, hydrated and supple after each wash, absolutely love it!"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,luxury at affordable price ,"I’ve always wanted to try Tatcha & this was my first Tatcha purchase. It has a mild scent, mild scrub feels to the skin. Leave my skin looks beautiful every-time I use. I use it 2-3 times a week & love it!"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,one of the favourite cleanser ,the best cleaner for all type of skin...I'm using this product almost 3years..I seen a lot of changes in my skin appearance ..great product and must buy..value for money 
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Gentle Exfoliator,"I have pretty sensitive combination skin, this worked well as a gentle exfoliator that I can use to wash my face every other day. The only issue is that sometimes, it can cause breakouts around my nose and chin. But, I still like it because it really helps even out my skin texture. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,By far the BEST!,"Already tried both tatcha cleanser and it works wonders. Love how my face feels like after using it. It really does its job. Price wise, worth every penny. Totally recommended. The best so far👏🏻"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,mister ,"First time trying and will restock when finished.  So pleasant to use, it’s a light weight cleanser and not harsh, and little goes a long way.  Not heavily scented which is great and won’t leave skin too dry after cleansing.  "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,good daily cleanser,"not harsh on skin, leave skin supple and clean. good for daily use. the scent makes it divine to use. only problem is the lid, need to squeeze the bottle to get the product out, most often than not i experience too much product coming out. will only repurchase if it comes with a pump. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,USA,Tatcha The Deep Cleanse,Llevo exactamente una sema usandolo y me encanta me ha funcionado super bien uso solamente el deep cleanse y the water cream and i love it puedo notar la diferencia
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Exfoliating cleanser but not too dry,It has little bits in it that does that extra exfoliation and a little goes a long way. Doesn’t strip your face of all the moisture even though it’s exfoliating! I like to use it to cleanse my face either before a mask or after a day of extra heavy makeup. Wouldn’t recommend it for daily use though!
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Effective but squeeze bottle hard to use,"The product cleans well with a gentle scrub, face does not feel overly dry so overall I do like this product. However the smell might not appeal to everyone. The squeeze bottle sometimes results in you pushing out more than you need - for this product, a little goes a long way. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,miracle in a bottle,"highly recommended especially to those with combination and sensitive skin like myself. definitely worth every cent you paid for! skin feel smoother, fresh and not tight after cleansing. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Not worth the hype,Did not see any significant difference. Product did not break me out or strip of the natural oils on my face. But I would rather spend my money on other products. 
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,"Gentle, effective exfoliator",This is by far the gentlest scrub I’ve ever used. You can feel the grainy loofah bits yet your face never feels scrubbed.. wash it off and my skin felt the softest it has ever been! 
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,New user,first time trying this. buy it during sale. worth the money and i love the smell. so refreshing when apply to my face. it also does not make my skin dry. I have a combination skin so certain face wash can cause irritation and drying my skin.  I really recomend this face wash😁
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,Ms,Bad customer service! I ordered item from Sephora with free gift. After 2 days told me that no stock for the gift. And said:”Even if it has been added on your cart it doesn't mean that it will be really in stock since it will still be processed at the warehouse.” Cheating company! 
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,amazing!,"I love this product. First time I used this was when I received mini version of this as a point gift, and here I am purchasing it:) this product smells good, but not strong fragrance. After I wash my face, my skin feels so good. Highly recommended:) "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,absolutely fav!,"I know it’s just basic facial wash, why bother purchase expensive facial wash... but keep coming back to this. Doesn’t make my face tightly pulled, does the job well with cleansing, and the most important thing : doesn’t break me out! Just hope it gets restocked frequently as i’m starting to have anxiety if I’m running out of this but haven’t got the new one."
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,this just isn’t it for me ,"I am so disappointed in this product. I bought it during the 20% off sale so I cannot return it. I broke out so bad and it’s so disappointing. My face was red and itchy and irritated. My face felt so tight and it was the worst experience I have ever had with a cleanser. Seriously guys, I would say not to invest in this because for the price it is so disappointing. I had little bumps coming out all over my face. This is just not it. Truly disappointed. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,Awesome product ,Awesome product. Skin feels so clean and soft after using this cleanser. I use the cleanser with my Foreo device for optimum results. Highly recommended! 
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,worth !! ,"This is my first time trying Tatcha product, surprisingly this cleanser is super good! It reduces my size of pores and the smell of it is really good . "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,soooo smooth,"Bought this during sale due to the price, its totally worth it! Suitable for normal to oily skin, the result was soooooo good everytime i clean my face with this! No dry effect. Your face will feel smooth instantly. The smell is kinda weird at first, but you will love it and actually is not bad at all! I recommended this as this product line has been giving good reviews ever since."
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,good product.,Very gentle on skin. Bought the mini ones first and loved it! Worth every penny. Tatcha products are very classy and beautiful. Hope they would introduce a combo! Both cleaners & moisturiser combo with a better price 😬
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Tatcha The Deep Cleanse,Product feels very nice during washing and it doubles up as an exfoliator as well. The best part is that my skin does not feel tight nor dry after washing and it feels perfectly soft and moisturized.
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,Cleansing and exfoliation all in one ,"Love the formula of the cleanser, the exfoliating scrubs is a game changer! It is gentle and clean your face really well, doesn't leave your face dry."
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,High Quality Product & Value for Money!,This product is high quality and certainly value for money. Just a small bit of the product is sufficiently to do the job and the bottle will last a long time. It really makes the face feel thoroughly cleanse and does not dry the skin. I will certainly buy it again!
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,great cleanser,this one is a good cleanse with mild exfoliating beads keeps skin clean and glowing a liitle goes long way so for the price u get decent quantity must try 
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,awesome product,"just a small little dollop every wash, but it cleans so well! love that it doesnt leave a dry feeling on my face after washing. perfect for sensitive skin like mine. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,ms,Even after first cleansing can see that face is brighter. It has tiny granules that slide over the face which I expect to melt away but it remains I think as a form of light scrub. Let’s see how it goes as I continue to use it
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,second purchase ,So far my best cleanser ever ! My second purchase already. It cleans my skin well without drying them out. Feels so fresh. I recommend this product to my friend and she love it too
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Great daily cleanser,"I have combi skin and this is a good daily cleanser. Doesn’t feel harsh on my skin. Skin doesn’t feel dry after use as compared to other cleansers, gentle feeling when using. After wash, skin feels nice and hydrated as it doesn’t strip all your natural oils away. Love the packaging. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,best so far ,Ok honestly I love my atomy foam cleanser but when I used this immediately felt a difference in my skin. It was soft and clean. Feels like heaven. I was afraid I was gonna love this because now I have to buy it everytime it runs out!! But beauty is money amirite
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,All Time Fave!,"This is by far the best cleanser I’ve ever used. It smells so so so good and is so gentle yet effective. I love the gentle tiny scrub. Plus if you compare, the price is not bad for other cleansers in the same size. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,nice clean luffa wash ,"Product without strong fragrance smell, after use, face feel clean and fresh. Nice texture with luffa fibre and skin easily absorb the moisturiser after wash. The opening of a new bottle was not with a seal so, less hygienic when received that. "
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,new favourite,"i cant believe i haven’t found this cleanser sooner! i have dry combination skin and this is one of the few cleansers i’ve tried that actually makes my skin feel clean, whilst not stripping off all the oils!! like some of these cleansers for dry skin just makes me feel like i didn’t wash my face properly cause there’s still “oil” left but this rly changed the game for me"
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Singapore,Clean ,"It does a deep cleanse. It's more towards a gel to watery consistency. It has luffa fruit fibers with gently exfoliate the skin. It doesn't give strip your skin leaving you with a tight and dry skin. After washing my face feels plump and hydrated. However, i hope more thought could be put to the packaging, the mechanism could be change to a pump which will easily dispense the product without cause waste."
TATCHA-The Deep Cleanse,Malaysia,my best cleanser,i wanted to try this after reading the positive reviews. i love this cleanser. gentle enough for everyday use and my face feels fresh and clean everytime. just a little drop goes a long way so it'll last me a while. packaging is great and price is not too bad. 
CLINIQUE-Take the Day Off Micellar Cleansing Towelettes for Face & Eyes,Malaysia,I received this in a very bad condition ,"I received this in apparently damaged condition. I report it to the person in charge and after few email and weeks later I got refund .I nvr get to tested it , I hope next time clinique can be more careful in inspecting their good before send it out "
CLINIQUE-Take the Day Off Micellar Cleansing Towelettes for Face & Eyes,Singapore,wipe off makeup ,Removes makeup easily and does not dry out the face. Able to remove waterproof eye makeup. this is a moisturising wipe. There’s no strong chemical smell either.
CLINIQUE-Take the Day Off Micellar Cleansing Towelettes for Face & Eyes,Singapore,Stings the eyes,Perhaps the product isn’t for my skin as it stings the eye area especially when I tried to wipe my eyeliners as well. I would prefer the cleansing wipes from Sephora.
CLINIQUE-Take the Day Off Micellar Cleansing Towelettes for Face & Eyes,,Dried out wipes,Wipes are dried out and can barely feel any moist in each sheet. Used 2 wipes to remove sunblock on face and it does not glide on smoothly over skin due to lack of moisture.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,New Zealand,Best cleanser!,this cleanser is honestly so good! it got rid of most of the texture I had on my face and it just feels so good to use. makes my skin feel clean without drying it.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,Canada,Sephora Collection Smoothing Cleanser,it improved my skin texture a lot especially my forehead (which is now much smoother)
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,Malaysia,Daily cleanser,A daily cleanser that leaves my skin clean and fresh!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,Australia,Nice cleanser,"I’ve recently updated my skin care routine for the first time in 14 years. I’m pretty fussy with what I want from my cleanser (gel not cream, lathers well but not too bubbly, no/minimal scent) and this ticks all the boxes above. My skin feels lovely and clean. Only loses half a star because I feel like I need a fair bit of product each time I use it so the tube will run out faster than I initially expected  "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,Singapore,Does it's Job,"Doesn't strip my skin. It's gentle. Good basic face wash. A good way to introduce chemical exfoliants for beginners. I have blackheads and clogged pores in my T zone, I didn't see any significant improvement after using it daily for few months. I think such problems would require leave on products rather than a face wash."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection Smoothing Cleanser,"It smells a little synthetic but it hasn’t caused any issues so I’m settling on 3 stars. But if you’re going to buy something that’s drugstore quality, might as well go to a drugstore and pay drugstore prices"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,Canada,Sephora Collection Smoothing Cleanser,"I've been using this cleanser for about 2 weeks so far. I had been using Cetaphil for a long time previously but I decided I wanted my cleanser to work a little harder for me which is exactly what this one has done. My skin is much smoother, and my breakouts have already lessened big time. A little goes a long way, you really don't need very much at a time which is great since there's only the one size of tube. The bottle does warn that the active ingredients can cause sun sensitivity so be sure to use some SPF if you're heading outside. I personally have been outside in the sun everyday since using this, with SPF, and haven't had any issues with sensitivity or sunburns. If you're looking for a cleanser that will put in some work without emptying your wallet, this is a great one to try. I'm glad I decided to try this one first before jumping into a super expensive cleanser assuming more money means more better, which this cleanser proves definitely isn't true. Photo is a close up of my left cheek which used to be a problem break out spot for me but is actually clear now."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,Malaysia,Might have purging,I have purging at first week of using this. maybe because of AHA BHA. But after that my face not having acne or bumps at all. Also Deep cleanse but if you have combi or dry skin it will dry your face more. you need to put moisturiser or face mist after that 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,Canada,Sephora Collection Smoothing Cleanser,"It does the job, i’ve noticed my skin is smoother. lasts a while since you don’t need much. pretty simple, good ingredients."

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,Australia,not for me ,This cleanser feels nice whilst using it but for whatever reason I always seem to break out a day or two later. I use other chemical exfoliants without any dramas but this cleanser doesn’t work for me. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,New Zealand,Mrs,This product is a a good and soft on the skin cleanser. It cleans my skin well. However I am looking for a more strong and better version to make it more radiant and glow.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,Philippines,not for everyday use on sensitive skin,"I use this when I feel that my skin is getting oily and it works to cleanse my skin. I tried using 3 days in a row my face felt itchy - I have sensitive skin so it's kind of normal reaction maybe, now I just use this once or twice a week and it's fine.  I'm not going to repurchase tho."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,USA,UV EXPOSURE WARNING!,No where on this page does it say there is a UV Exposure warning on this product.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,Canada,Sephora Collection Smoothing Cleanser,"I have struggled with skin texture and tiny bumps on my chin and forehead for years and nothing has worked. I was previously issuing Glow Recipe’s  Watermelon Toner hoping it would help with my texture but it never worked. After using this cleanser for only a week, I already see a dramatic improvement in my skin’s texture, and my skin is so soft and smooth. I have dry skin and it doesn’t dry it out at all. Highly highly recommend!!"

This one is 98% natural origins ingredients which helps to exfoliate skin to appear smooth skin. It is also fragrance free! 😍😍"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,Canada,Sephora Collection Smoothing Cleanser,Wanted it to be a dupe of the DDG AHA/BHA cleanser while my local store was sold out. It smells kind of…rotten. Like when a face product turns. And definitely nothing like the resurfacing cleansers from DDG or PTR. Some smoothing. I might have finished it at this price point if it didn’t smell so bad.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,Canada,Nailed It!,"I'm amazed at how cheap this cleanser is considering what it does. This is the best exfoliating cleanser I've ever used, hands down. My skin gets very easily irritated by higher concentrations of acids (especially BHA) and I'm assuming that the concentrations are relatively low in this cleanser since they aren't specified. The other 100+ reviews aren't lying when they say this is gentle - so gentle I can use it twice a day, everyday. But despite that, it still works. My skin has never been smoother, no flakiness or dehydration even though this winter has been especially harsh, and so clear. And clean and fragrance free, to boot! I'm a bit annoyed with myself that I was paying over 3X as much for a cleanser that admittedly I also liked, but I like this one even better! Don't change a thing, Sephora, you nailed it!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,Canada,Sephora Collection Smoothing Cleanser,"I loveee this cleanser! Leaves my face smooth and soft, lathers really nicely and no scent! Helps keep my skin clear with the BHA and AHA (I don’t have bad acne just occasional spots and this clears them up in a day or 2!) just try it !!"

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,USA,Love this product,"I have combo skin and finding the right cleanser can be tricky. After one use of this product, I noticed my skin looked brighter and felt smoother. I’ll definitely continue using this cleanser!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,USA,I LOVE IT. My skin looks SO healthy and glowy!,"This Sephora Smoothing Cleanser really DOES smooth out your skin.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,USA,happy glowing skin!,After using this cleanser a couple of times a week I can happily say I have seen a beautiful change in the texture of my skin. Normally my skin will react in a very unpleasant way when switching to a new facial cleanser but I am happy to report that didn’t happen! I wanted to give it a fair shot before reviewing and I’m pleased. I did receive this as a gift.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,Philippines,love love the cleanser,I was so excited to try having both aha and bha content on this cleanser. My skin just loves it. No breakouts at all. It is gentle on my skin while cleansing it. I just finished it so I am ordering again. If only this product existed way back my university days(stressed on thesis) maybe my pimples or acne would have been prevented or healed faster that time hahaha but so glad now it is gonna be my main cleanser and alternate with dr jart at times since both worls well on me. No more exfoliating soaps for me that is so harsh on my skin. Again no breakouts or allergies while using this cleanser. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection Smoothing Cleanser,Pretty good face wash. It’s a good value and works pretty well. Didn’t get all my makeup off so you may want to use makeup remover first.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,USA,So gentle!,I love this cleanser! The aha and bha are actually so gentle yet cleansing. I adore this!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,USA,"disappointing, not worth it","i got this about a month ago and purchased it with the BHA spot clearing gel and the moisturizer. i’ve never had breakouts this bad happen to me before, but
because of school stress and constant work it was bound to happen. like i said, i got it about a month or so ago, so if it was supposed to do something, it would have by now, and it seems like it just keeps infecting my old pimples and acne spots from the amount of times they came back in the span of a month???? i’m always consistent with it and tried so hard to give it a chance, but it’s gotten past the pore purging part and i finally ran out of patience with it. it’s never ending and didn’t change anything about my skin and you can see that the before and after pictures are literally the same. if anything, just a waste of money."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,USA,Broke me out :( NOT a replacement for AMA Cleanser,"Tried this since they discontinued the AMA Clean Skin Gel Cleanser which I LOVED. This is NOT a good replacement it completely broke me out. I guess i will have to find something else. I will say sephora online beauty advisor is working on finding me something with similar ingredients, which i appreciate."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection Smoothing Cleanser,This cleanser is gentle enough for my sensitive skin! I don’t like using too many products on my face so this is a great multi-tasking cleaner. This affordable cleaner will be in my skincare lineup!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,USA,Surprisingly gentle + fragrance free,"I was gifted this product, but this review is my honest opinion!

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,USA,Great option for gentle everyday cleanser!,"This is a great and gentle cleanser. I use it day and night as per of my skin care routine alongside the cleansing brush. I do feel it has helped with clearing up breakouts due to wearing face masks and menstrual cycles.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Smoothing Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection Smoothing Cleanser,This is such an amazing cleanser! Sephora collection gifted it to me and I am so impressed with it! I use it on my face every night and it’s so mild on my sensitive skin but also helps my skin feel deep cleaned!

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Malaysia,Just ok,"I wanted a cleanser that was gentle and kind for my skin and tried this milk cleanser. Although it does what it is supposed to do, I cannot overlook its texture and feel that is “slippery” which makes you work harder to rinse off. "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,New fave,"Great cleanser! I used to have oily combination skin, and now my skin seems to be a bit drier.  ￼ I happen to be in the store when the rep was there and she was good lol I purchased the cleanser and I don’t regret it at all… It takes up all my make up and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I will definitely continue to buy this. it’s not oily and it is easy to rinse off."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Singapore,Make up remover that doesnt remove make up,"I realllyyy wanted to love this product. the almond milk might be sensitive. My skin is not at all sensitive skin type. I can basically throw any new product on my face and i would almost never get a reaction. However, the first time i use this, my eyes sting, my entire face stings. Worse of all, my make up was not removed at all. Foundation was still on my face so dont talk about the eye make up hanging on my face. Disappointing, i returned it within the day"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Malaysia,omg,"The sweet and nutty natural aroma of delectable almond reminds you of the star ingredient within and is both cosy and comforting. If you have dry or sensitive skin that’s in need of a touch of nourishing TLC every time you cleanse then the Caudalie Almond Milk is for you. Plus, if you were a fan of Caudalie’s Gentle Cleansing Milk then this is just as gentle and effective, but now even more eco-responsible."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,"This is my favourite product to “take off the day” before I start my nighttime skin care routine. I wouldn’t recommend this as a sole cleanser to remove makeup (especially waterproof eye makeup). That said, it is useful when you need a quick refreshing clean up that leaves your skin hydrated and smooth."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,So soothing!,"I’m in love! It’s a lightweight breathable texture, and it helps so much with stressed and burnt skin! It’s very calming and easy to apply and pair with a routine. It has a stronger smell but that’s expected when working with almond milk!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Malaysia,Testing,Bought this as i could not my hands on The Inkey Oat Cleansing Balm.  It is not thick and does smell a bit off. But it does what is it supposed to do. Overall ok but there are better options out there. 
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Doesn’t Remove Makeup,"In English it’s advertised as a “Cleansing Milk” but in French the name is “Démaquillant” (meaning makeup remover) which is what I read (I’m bilingual ). When using this, it completely fails at removing any eye or face makeup. I prefer using cleansers that also remove makeup, so I’d recommend the Tatcha Rice Wash for dry or normal skin or the Deep Cleanse for oilier skin instead"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Malaysia,caudalie vinoclean cleanser,"Bought this as my night cleanser but unfortunately its not suitable for my dry area face. It makes even drier. But i love the ingredient though, so clean and no harsh chemicals. "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,"I enjoy double cleansing at night, after caudalie oil makeup remover I use this, the first time I used it i felt I was applying silk to my face, after my fifth day of microneedling which I was still sinsitive it cleanses very well and gentle, I removed it with my wet Halo pad. So satisfying. I applied Ren oil elixir, Tula eye balm. My skin is glowing. Worked for me!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Gentle cleanser,"This cleanser is so gentle  that it doesn’t remove eye makeup very well. After cleansing,  I have to use an additional eye maker remover which was what I was trying to avoid. It’s good for when you you aren’t wearing makeup.  The scent and texture are nice and it doesn’t irritate eyes."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Love love love this face wash! It’s a great makeup remover and leaves my skin feeling great!
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Nay for me,smells weird but not an issue it’s just dries up my skin and leave an itchy feeling on my cheeks
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Off-putting smell,"I'm sure this works fine, but the overpowering scent of almond extract was enough for me to return it after a single use. I love almonds, but this was too much for me."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Singapore,okay,The new formulation isn’t as good as the previous one. First off the smell is sickly. Doesn’t leave my skin as moisturised or feeling hydrated like the older version. Don’t think I’ll repurchase. 
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,"Hands down my favorite cleanser now for ten plus years. It’s non foaming. I hate foaming cleansers, but it COMPLETELY removes all of my makeup, especially eye makeup, without a bit of irritation. I’ll never stray. This is the best makeup removing cleanser out there!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,"Really miss the old formula.  This is still a good cleanser, but the old formula felt, smelled and worked better.  Please bring the old one back!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Nice but not totally effective as a standalone,"I love the creamy consistency and smell. You only need a small amount so the 6.7 oz size will last quite a while. For context, I wear very little makeup. On my most ""made-up"" day, I wear only a tiny bit of tinted moisturizer as I don't like makeup on my face in general. My skin is flawless. 
The cleanser doesn't remove all of the makeup on the first try. So, I deducted a star. This cleanser is better as the first step to a double-cleansing routine. That said, I don't think it would do the job as a standalone cleanser.  Also, would not recommend to heavy makeup wearers."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Canada,FAV CLEANSER - GENTLE YET EFFECTIVE,I’ve been using this cleanser for over a month now & I love the way it makes my skin feel & look! I double cleanse therefore I prefer cleansers that are very mild and does not strip my skin. This did exactly that!! My skin is left feeling soft and radiant. I also love the packaging of this cleanser as well! If you are looking for something that is oil controlling and/or exfoliating this cleanser is not for you!
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Singapore,love it! ,"Good for combination and sensitive skin, love that texture is is creamy excellent to remove make up/ sunblock. Using it daily before facial wash. Will repurchase again! 
"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Malaysia,gentle and affordable ,"This is a nice cleanser, gentle and super affordable. Definitely a no brainer, if you don’t know what cleanser to get, this is a good one to try out. "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Australia,Does a nice job,"Nice texture - not too foamy, doesn't dry my skin. Quite a strong almondy smell, but I don't mind that so much. Rinses well. Not my absolute fave, but a good option as an alternate cleanser."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Have on used a few times but so far I’m happy! My skin always looks red/irritated after cleansing and for the first time it doesn’t with this cleanser. 4 stars because I’ve only been using for a few days
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Canada,Ehhh,"Very okay. Not worth the price, doesn’t feel like anything. It smells pleasant and doesn’t feel harsh but doesn’t not remove makeup at all. It’s kind of moves it around but nothing comes off. I can’t think of a anything positive but the smell and the fact that it’s a clean brand. First aid beauty is stills clean brand and can offer the same product at a lower reprice point."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,"Perfect Product, Easy to use.","Cleans wonderfully, smells fresh, leaves the skin perfect. I highly recommend it, it’s my second bottle and I will purchase again."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Inferior to previous cleansing milk,"I have been using Caudalie cleansing milk for years and thought I would never have to look for the perfect cleanser again. I had finally found a cleanser that didn't leave my face feeling tight. Unfortunately, they have ruined the formula. Not impressed with any of the new ""Vinoclean"" products I've tried tbh. They could have at least stated somewhere that it was a new/different product. Now I have to look for another cleanser :("
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Singapore,cleansing Almond milk,"Gentle On the Skin, and feels fresh and clean after using this milk cleanser! The scent is light and the pump makes it easy without spilling! Suitable for normal skin."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Australia,gentle and smells great,"Very gentle and has a beautiful scent. Works well on dry skin, feel very soothing. 
Does not remove makeup all that well, and definitely need to double cleanse with another cleanser on days where I’ve worn sunscreen with makeup. "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Australia,just okay,"I forgot I don’t like almond smelling things, it’s like marzipan. Aside from the scent it was just ok. Didn’t leave my skin dry but it also didn’t make it feel hydrated. I used it as a second cleanse as it is not helpful at all in actually removing makeup. Even as a second cleanse my face didn’t feel that clean afterwards and I’d go in with a third cleanser. After getting through half the bottle I used it as a body wash or a morning cleanser or on days where I wore no makeup or even sunscreen."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Malaysia,perfect!,"This product works best on my skin!! I really appreciate this product 😍 Dry skin gonna love this. The smell is fine actually and not thattttt bad ok! Hey, I don’t understand why some people are disgust by the smell 🙄"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,New Zealand,It's okay,"Smells lovely like marzipan! Does not remove makeup at all. A nice cleanser but it doesn't leave my skin feeling overly clean, wouldn't reccomend for acne prone skin."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Malaysia,Squeaky Clean,I got this during sales and the price is quite decent. About two bottles at once and I’m excited to try this milk cleanser out! Hopefully it doesn’t dry out my  skin. :)
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Malaysia,Creamy and smooth milk,Really like this new milk cleanser! It is so smooth and creamy when applied to face. It is gentle enough to use it in the AM and is not too drying for my skin. The consistency is just perfect. Will definitely repurchase.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,mmmmm!,"Gentle on my skin, helped with dryness, and impurities. Idk why or how it has improved all this and my skin tone but… never going back. It removes makeup quite effectively as well."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,No No No,I don’t know what Caudalie did to the formula but this product went from being a hero to a… Not a zero.  Zero would be better.  My skin felt tight and painful.  The fragrance isn’t bad if you don’t mind the scent of medical equipment.  I’m now petrified to try other products of theirs that I used to love and they changed.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,What just happened?,"I followed the instructions on the back of the bottle, and that was a right mess! Pad after pad full of makeup and I still had a full face of makeup that I had to take off using something else. So, I read the instructions right here on the site and followed those, and I might as well had washed my face with water! It would have worked better. This didn't do anything to remove makeup, even though it was formulated for just that purpose. I have no idea what this does. It smells lovely... it's a lovely smelling dud."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Malaysia,Gentle cleansing ,Love it.. A gentle cleansing milk. No fragrance which is good. Very gentle to ur skin. Moisturizing. Suitable for those with dry skin.  Skin feels clean and moisture. Just nice. 
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,"I think this product does an ok job of removing makeup, but not as well as Boscia Cooling Makeup Breakup.  It doesn’t remove my mascara as well, and it burns my eyes (Boscia did not burn my eyes at all and I would really get in there).  I bought the Caudalie because Sephora no longer carries the Boscia, so thought I’d give it a shot. I’ll use it up, but will likely go back to Boscia.  Note- I use Fresh Soy Face Wash as my second step cleanser, so I’m not using either Caudalie or Boscia on their own."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,"#NOTafreeproduct I use this as a quick cleanser. It doesn't dry out my skin. On makeup and sunscreen days, I still need to follow up with another cleanser or toner to really clean my skin."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,"smells bad, not gentle.",SO DISAPPOINTED. I LOVED the old gentle cleanser because it made my face feel so clean but never stripped of moisture. This new face wash smells AWFUL and left my skin feeling strips of moisture. So bummed. Will be returning this and searching other brands.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Really miss the old formula - whyyy????,"I can see I am one of the few here that was not sent a free product. So please beware of the many reviews that were sent the new formula for free.  I was a loyal customer of the old cleansing milk. It had a beautiful fresh slight grape scent to it, it was absolutely lovely. I bought the new formula. While it still has the beautiful texture and slides nicely across the face I don't know that I love the almond scent. I like almond generally but i just really loved the scent in the old formula. Don't know why they changed it. Why on earth did they change it, it was perfect before and had many positive reviews before. Please change it back or offer another one with the old scent please!!!!!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Great!!!,I enjoy trying out the Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk. It really helped me with removing my make up. The pump really makes it easy for the product to come out end it smells great!! #trywithtopbox #freeproduct
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Stripped skin without removing makeup,"I got this because I’m looking to find a non-comedogenic makeup removing cleanser and this one had great reviews. I have sensitive/combination skin and I’m dealing with some blemishes at the moment. The fragrance on this was actually much stronger than I expected and it actually somehow both stripped my skin and didn’t remove my makeup completely... probably fine for some, but I’m too sensitive for it. I’m going to return it."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Clean face!,"#freeproduct #trywithtopbox I’ve been trying out the Caudalie
Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk For about a week now and I feel a difference at night after I remove my make up. I feel like it picks up the oils really easily And keeps my combination skin clean!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Gentle and effective,"I really like this cleanser. I like that the texture is smooth and creamy, and it doesn’t foam up or have physics exfoliators in it. It’s gentle, but my skin feels clean and smooth after I use it. It’s not overwhelming, but it definitely smells like almond, so if you don’t like that scent it’s probably not for you. The only reason I don’t give it five stars is because I don’t love the scent. It’s fine, but not what I would’ve chosen."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,LOVE THIS STUFF!!!,I have been super dry lately from starting retinol/Summer/skin issues and needed a super moisturizing cleanser to baby my skin. I was going to buy the Laneige Milk Oil Cleanser but noticed this was a little cheaper. I smelled it and was sold. It smells amazing. This stuff takes all of my makeup off (I use it with water like a normal cleanser) and leaves my skin baby soft and so moisturized. I have to remind myself to put on moisturizer because my skin is so supple just from this stuff. It’s the first thing I’ve used EVER that I feel gets all of my makeup off. This stuff will definitely be a new staple in my routine.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Just Meh,I was using this as a cleanser but my face never really felt clean and after a week I started to breakout. I was very upset when this happened because my skin typically loves caudalie products and then I actually read the bottle…. This is not a cleanser! *Just in case someone else out there is as goofy as me* Thankfully my skin cleared up quickly after actually washing my face. I’m only giving this 3 stars because it’s just ok as a makeup remover and I don’t think its worth the price.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,"I haven’t worn makeup in over a year but still bought this to use as a secondary cleanser to remove dirt, sunscreen, etc after the caudalie acne cleanser. I love the smell of this, anything almond is yum to me. It’s very nourishing on my but I am not sure if it doing anything for my skin. I prefer the other Caudalie cleansers. Will use the rest but probably will not re-purchase. I do love the smell though."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,"This didn’t remove any makeup, including my tubing mascara. It just rubbed it into my skin and I had to use another cleanser to remove and wash. Returned."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Perfect for dry skin!! soothing and smells good!!,Excellent cleanser for DRY skin. This is sooo soothing. I have to remove my makeup first and then use this. This is too gentle to remove makeup. I skip toner or essence because this is such a great moisturizing cleanser. I love using this in the morning. It smells like an almond cookie
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Oily Cooked Kale,"In the winter and spring, my skin gets quite dry, so I need an effective yet gentle cleanser. This Almond Milk seemed to fit the bill. The first thing that hits you is the sour cooked kale smell. I guess you either like it or you don’t. I don’t. In terms of effectiveness, this cleanser is best used as a second step in a double cleanse because it’s not effective at removing makeup. It also leaves an oily film which is okay if you have dry skin and are looking for extra moisture - which I am during my “dry seasons.” Will I finish the bottle? Yes. Would I buy this again? No."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,This has been my go to for years! Cleanses well and very gentle on my sensitive skin.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,I really wanted to love this. But I don't.,"I love Caudalie products. I really do. So when I went looking for a cleansing milk, I assumed I would also love this. I did read the lukewarm reviews and that people are upset that they changed the formula and fragrance, but I bought it anyway. I don't love it. I don't even really like it. I don't dislike the smell (although it is really strong), but I don't actually feel like my face is clean after I use it. I doubt I'll even finish the bottle, which is a big no-no for me. I will keep using their other products but I certainly won't buy this one again."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Canada,Gentle and great product for dry skin,"I'm on my 2nd bottle. Almond, castor, grape seed, jojoba oil, oats, shea butter all are my dry skin best friends. This cleanser doesn't takes away my makeup but I love using it as a normal cleanser. I have extremely dry sensitive skin and I'm allergic to hundred of stuff so this works well for me. Almond oil However I don't use any cleanser if I'm not going out, and this is very soothing and gentle to use so I will keep buying this one!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,Singapore,New Formula Fails,"Long standing loyal lover of this products original fresh creamy texture and scent. New formula smells heavy like marzipan, I can’t stand to use it at all :( "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,I used this both at night to remove makeup from the day and during the day to provide a clean skin feel while still having intentions of hydrated skin. The cleansing milk is definitely a very different cream consistency. I am an avid cleansing oil user to remove my makeup as part of double cleansing. This does remove makeup but I would use this as my first step in double cleansing and it doesn’t melt the makeup the way I need it too. The picture with the cotton pad is how much makeup was still left on my skin after using both products from the line and I used my favorite serum toner to see how well these products work. I got this product sent to me as a  #freeproduct from Top Box Circle! #trywithtopbox
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Perfect for sensitive skin,"I have tried cleansers that claim to be gentle but strip my skin, leaving it feeling dry and irritated. Not so here! Caudalie’s Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk is truly gentle but very effective. It has a rich, creamy, lotion consistency with a light almond scent. It’s non-foaming and sulfate free, while effectively cleansing and removing all traces of makeup. Even eye makeup! It leaves my sensitive skin feeling clean, soft, and smooth. Highly recommended for anyone with reactive skin!  #freeproduct"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,the very best cleanser,"The Vinoclean gentle cleansing almond milk is the greatest cleanser I used ever. I have combination skin and this is a perfect one. After I start used I feel softer and moisture skin. The almond milk and castor oil helps skin to be moisture all day. 

It cleans all dirt from skin even my makeup which is very good.

This has a great value for the price. Highly recommend

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Makeup Remover Extroideneer,"People are always worried about incorporating an oil based product into their routine (especially if they have oily skin), but this is a fantastic product that does not leave your face oily afterwards! You apply it on dry skin, rub it in and then apply water which emulsifies the product (turns it white, almost soapy) and then rinses off easily leaving your skin hydrated. Love this product! #FREEPRODUCT #TRYWITHTOPBOX"

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,This one wasn't for me.,"I received this as a #freeproduct. I wanted to like it so bad, since I originally liked one of their cleansers. Unfortunately, this product was a miss for me. It did absolutely nothing for me. I saw no benefits or changes. I used for an extended amount of time to get results and it just wasn't for me. I did not like the way it felt after applying to my skin. It felt like it left something behind. My skin was still dry after using. I used this product along with a toner, of the same brand, morning and night."

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Your skin will be so hydrated!,"My first impression after washing my face for the first time I wasn't too sure I would like this because it felt like a film was left on my skin, but I was so wrong. I love this, I didn't even realize how dry my skin was until I started using this! The ""film"" which is just a light moisturizer soaked into my skin and my skin felt great all day. This has a almond extract scent, it reminds me of cookies so I like it."

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Great Almond Milk Cleanser,"""ABOUT CLAUDALIE""
Cleanse away your day with Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk. And this formula is great for all skin types, including those with sensitive skin. This almond milk cleansing lotion will wash away makeup & impurities & it uses a jojoba oil that is known to soften & prevent de-hydration. It also contains sweet almond oil, which is a radiance boosting ingredient that is perfect for stressed out skin. And it has moisturising shea butter, antiinflammatory & decongesting cornflower extract & Caudalie's signature polyphenols which are rich in antioxidants. 

""MY THOUGHTS""
I personally really enjoyed using Claudalie's Vinoclean Cleansing Almond Milk, this was my first time ever using it before & I've been using it along with Claudalie's Vinoclean moisturizing toner together for the last 3 wks now. The cleanser really left my skin feeling hydrated & clean. Its designed to be used directly onto your dry skin, or you can use a cotton pad, I prefer putting it directly onto my skin & massaging in circular motions, this formula is safe to be swept over your eyes as well. Then rinse off with a cotton pad soaked in water or a toner, preferably Caudalie's vinoclean moisturizing toner. This can be done in the morning & evening. This cleanser & toner combined is the bomb, & does not leave you feeling greasy even though this cleanser has castor oil in its formula & did you know that castor oil helps to fortify & condition your lashes?! So that's a added bonus if ya ask me! All while cleansing & nourishing your skin you're always conditioning your lashes & helping them grow. So if you are looking for a great cleanser that's affordable & vegan friendly I recommend you try out Caudalie's Vinoclean Cleansing Almond Milk & pair it with Caudalie Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner. 

I was gifted this product from topbox in exchange for my honest feedback, all opinions are my very own.

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Very classy,I was able to try this amazing gentle cleaning almond milk and i!I'm highly satisfied! This is my first experience with a texture like this and it's very easy to use. I used it at night to remove makeup and refresh. My skin was super soft and velvety no heavy reside left behind. I really love the scent of this product its perfect! I definitely have a top spot on my vanity for this product. Overall my skin feels clean and makeup free plus the result of hydrated skin. I would highly recommend it. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Very refreshing and gentle,the cleanser is very gentle on the skin . It feels very hydrating and removed makeup as well. I love the smell it smells like almond and has mild fragrance which does not irritate my sensitive skin at all. Love the way it has become a daily in my routine now.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,"So at first I was a bit confused if this was supposed to be a cleanser or makeup remover but I kind of use it as cleanser in combination with the toner. I like to use it to cleanse my face after removing my makeup with a makeup remover wipe. Although the directions say to apply the cleansing milk and remove it with a cotton round, I prefer to just simply wash it off. It does a great job at removing any excess makeup while keeping it moisturizer. Oh and it smells amazing! #trywithtopbox"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,"Thanks to Topbox Circle, I was able to test Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk for free. It's a nice, gentle, non-drying cleanser with a light almond fragrance. It left my skin soft after using it in the morning and at night. I do find it odd that the label printed on the bottom says to apply with a cotton pad. Just now looking up the product on the website, I see the How To Use suggests three pumps into the hand or a cotton pad to apply. While this seems to be more of a spa-like technique/experience that will use much more product than I would like for the price. Regardless, it is an effective, luxurious product. However, I prefer the traditional wet and lather to cleanse. The Cleansing Almond Milk would a treat to have on a plane, where a shared sink would be less than ideal to perform the morning beauty regimen.

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Smells great,What an amazingly gentle cleanser. I also like the bottle that the cleanser came in and how convenient it is to get the correct product quantity. The cleanser itself is semi thick and has an unforgettable smell. The fragrance is almond milk and this is a very moisturizing cleanser. The almond milk makes this cleanser ideal for all forms of facials.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Awesome product,I was very pleased with how smoothly it took away all makeup and residue from the makeup which was applied. I must say 1 of the best makeup/moisturizers iv come across.recieved as a test product.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,"I really like this almond cleansing milk. It has a rich, lotion-like texture and almond scent similar to amaretto. It removes my foundation/ face makeup easily when I use it with my face cleansing brush. I prefer to rinse my face with water after using this cleansing milk otherwise my skin feels heavy, like not fully cleansed. Removing my washable mascara was easy and my eyes did not feel irritated nor any stinging. Removing eyeshadow took a couple extra swipes with some cotton pads (especially shimmery shades). Overall its a great facial cleansing milk that leaves my skin soft, moisturized and clean.  #freeproduct"

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Love It,"I love this cleanser. I have really dry sensitive skin and this cleanser is so gentle. I pretty much use this cleanser to remove makeup which it does fairly quickly. I also enjoy using it in the mornings to wake up, cleanse and refresh my face. I found that this product really hydrated my skin. My skin always feels very moisturized when I use it. The scent is very invigorating. It smells exactly like almond milk. I usually just use my fingers to apply it all over my face and then I rinse it off. A little goes along way when using this cleanser. I don’t need much to get the job done. If you’re someone who has dry skin, I would totally recommend this cleanser because it’s really gentle and it doesn’t dry out your skin at all. #freeproduct"

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Gentle Face Cleanser,"At first, I was skeptical about using this Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk. I have previously used skincare products containing almond as an ingredient and such products ended up leaving my skin even more dry. I have a dry skin with large pores. I used this cleanser day and night. I used it first thing in the morning to clean my face and in the evening, to remove my makeup. I noticed it to be effective in removing makeup, dirt and debris. It is also very lightweight and gentle on my skin. It doesn't dry out my skin either. I like the milky texture of it. It is easy to massage the product into my skin. It has a pleasant almond scent to it too. The packaging is nice because it is re-closable too. This cleanser is designed for all skin types. It has worked for me, so I would recommend it to everyone. #freeproduct"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Very gentle on my skin,I love the pretty packaging. I also really enjoy the almond scent!

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Gentle Cleanser,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk is a very gentle cleanser that doesn't bubble up and has soft and creamy. The cleanser has an almond scent that is sweet and nutty. I like that the cleansing almond milk doesn't strip away skin oils and is extra gentle if you have sensitive skin. I didn't feel like my skin was tight or shiny compare to other cleansers that I have to instantly use moisturizer. This almond milk cleanser is perfect for my dry and irritated skin.

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Gentle And Hydrating Cleanser,"I loved the the smell of this VinoClean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk, mildly sweet almond fragrance, and the consistency of this cleansing milk when applied was a luxury in and of itself and it was easy to wash off, which made me contemplate and wonder if there are bath or hair products from Caudalíe for curlies like me! Off base, but I used ibin the mornings and at night before bed and my thirsty skin is satisfied and has never been more thankful for this hydrating cleanser as the dry patches of skin on my face aren't as noticeable now. I am loving this so much, the redness on my face has significantly improved after a few washes. The best part is it really softens my skin and it is super gentle, cleanses well and yes, yes, this #free product really does enhance lash growth...so cool! I love Caudalíe!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Love the texture!,This facial cleanser has a nice soft almond scent. The name Almond Milk fits the product well. I love how it removes makeup and everything with such a  small amount. The pump on the bottle works well and it is my preferred dispenser type. It has a lotion like feel because it is a medium consistency. I feel it is really good for my combo skin type. I have been using this everyday for 8 days exclusively and have noticed a more even complexion and softer skin. Does not clog pores. I was lucky enough to receive this as a #freeproduct.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Would recommend,I thought this product was super fun to use! It works really well and leaves my skin feeling clean and hydrated. Suitable for sensitive skin. Very subtle scent. Would definitely recommend! #freeproduct
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Fresh and Clean,I have dry skin and this works great. I use it morning and night. I really like the scent and texture. My face is clean and doesn't leave my skin feeling tight. I have had great results from it. #freeproduct
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Amazing product,"I am obsessed with this!! I have dry skin so using traditional cleanser twice a day really dries my skin out. This is exactly what I needed!! The smell is amazing, the texture is so creamy and my skin is so hydrated even though its winter. It took my makeup off so easily. Using this and the hydrating toner together is just amazing. I am so happy to have received this and will not be going back to regular cleansers. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Silky radiant skin!,"The almond milk cleanser is a dream come true. I have terribly dry skin, especially in the winter, and I often find myself settling when it comes to cleansers. This one leaves my skin feeling hydrated and radiant! The smell is absolutely delightful as well. Fragrance is light and natural in this products. I want to say similar to cherry blossom but not as heavy! I use the cleanser both day and night and I find it works wonders to remove my makeup. 
I would highly recommend this to anyone,  especially with dry skin. #FreeProduct"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Very gentle; smells like marzipan,"This cleanser is extremely gentle on the skin. It’s creamy and doesn’t foam, so it’s well suited for dry and sensitive skin types. I use it either to double-cleanse my skin after removing makeup with an oil-based cleanser, or on its own if I didn’t wear makeup that day. It’s gentle enough to use on my eyes too. I personally dislike the smell of marzipan/almond, it’s pretty strong, so be aware… If you’re looking for a very gentle daily cleanser and don’t mind the scent, this is for you."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,"This is a truly gentle cleanser. It works very well to remove impurities and calm the skin, and it doesn't ever leave my skin feel stripped of moisture. Every time I use this I feel like I've replenished my moisture barrier. It's calming and a relaxing part of my skincare routine, highly recommend!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Smells amazing leave skin happy,"This cleanser is amazing.  Use with or with out water. The smell of almond is beautiful.  My skin is happy since Ive been using it along with moisturizing toner. Its so cold this winter and last thing i want to do is wash my face at night. So this being able to use without water is a happy bonus 
#freeproduct"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Smells great!,"The Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk is different than any cleanser I have previously used. The cleanser does not foam up like traditional cleansers, but it still easily removes make-up and impurities. I find my reusable make-up removers work better than disposable pads with this cleanser. After using, my skin feels soft. I follow-up with the Vinopure Pore Purifying Gel Cleanser during the nighttime cleaning to prevent breakouts, then I apply the Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner, a serum, and moisturizer. To me the almond milk smells like sweet cherries, which I love. My skin is soft and looks great! #freeproduct"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,"It’s a free product sent to me for review. I have been using it for the past two weeks and so far it works great to remove my face makeup without causing any breakout or sensitivity. I usually like to use 3 pumps to clean my whole face and follow with cleansing foam. After cleansing, I use toner with the cotton pad to wipe my face, and never see any residual foundations from my face. Also, the cleansing milk has a hint of almond scent, which even for anyone who may not like almond scent should not have any issue with it. So overall, it’s a very gentle face makeup cleansing milk but works efficient."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Just what my skin needed! Perfection,"This cleansing almond milk is amazing. My skin has been so dry in these colder months and this cleanser has played a part in keeping my skin feeling hydrated. 
This almond milk cleanser does wonders with taking off my makeup. I keep it in my shower and pair it up with Caudalie’s Vinoclean moisturizing toner. Both pair so beautiful together. 
I have combination and sensitive skin. This doesn’t irritate my skin at all which is a huge plus. The texture of this milky and creamy. When applying it to my skin, it is very light and hydrating.

I’ve always been a huge fan of Caudalie and this product exceeded my expectations. My skin has never been happier. I would recommend this product!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Wonderful product,"This make-up remover is a new product in my gamut. When i use it i feel that my skin is protected and i really like its almond aroma. Since my skin is oily in summer and dry in winter,this remover keeps it nourished and clean. For this reason every time i remove my make-up is a very pleasant experience  . And i use it day and night.#freeproduct"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,"I received a free bottle of this cleansing milk from TopBox in exchange for my honest review.  I have to say it is very different from other cleansers I have tried - almost the consistency of a light lotion.  The scent is nice and light almond, and it feels very silky on my face.  Takes off my makeup very nicely and is super moisturizing.  My only issue is that it leaves somewhat of a residue on my skin.   I'm sure this is due to the moisturizing oils in the product, but it felt odd initially.  I do love the results though - my skin feels SO soft after use.  Love the natural ingredients as well."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,Gentle but effective,I received this product complimentary from Topbox #tryitwithtopbox. It's gentle but effective enough to remove makeup and oils. Doesn't strip the skin after and doesn't left tightening feeling.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Gentle Cleansing Almond Milk,USA,This is a new favorite,"I received this product free from Topbox in exchange for an honest review. When I got this in the mail I had no idea what this was. It says cleanser but it doesn't soap up. It's not like my usual make removers that are oil or cream. I read the back of the bottle and it said to use with a cotton pad to clean face and remove makeup. I started using it every day to pre-cleanse. I would get home and grab a cotton pad and apply a dime-sized amount. Then I'd remove my makeup, sunscreen, and skin care as well as any dirt and oils from the day. Then I'd use a gentle cleanser to finish cleansing. I quickly fell in love with this product. It's better than makeup wipes and less arduous than having to wash my face twice with an oil makeup remover. I love this for the everyday makeup removal and sunscreen removal. I will still use my Boscia Makeup Breakup for days in which I am wearing a heavier face of makeup but this is perfect for the everyday.

EVE LOM-Cleansing Oil Capsules,USA,Eve Lom Cleansing Oil Capsules - 50 pcs,I am so in love I have sensetive skin and this is so gentle and makes my skin feel so smooth and clean
EVE LOM-Cleansing Oil Capsules,USA,Eve Lom Cleansing Oil Capsules - 50 pcs,"LOVE THIS! This is gonna be my new travel staple now. Super easy to use, one capsule is more than enough for your whole face. The travel box is awesome, you can put up to 7 capsules in it. I use the Eve Lom cleansing cream regularly but this capsule is just so easy to use when you’re on the go. It doesn’t remove heavy eye makeup though so you will still need eye mu remover but I’m very happy with this purchase!"
EVE LOM-Cleansing Oil Capsules,USA,makes my eyes sting,this product is really convenient and great for travel. but it is too stinging for eyes that makes my eyes hurt and makes me cry for the whole time when i try to remove my makeup.
EVE LOM-Cleansing Oil Capsules,USA,Travel container is not good,I like the product but the travel sized container is terrible! Something was leaking and there's oil residue all over it. I still like the capsules but wish they made a better quality container (this is for the travel size).
EVE LOM-Cleansing Oil Capsules,USA,Eve Lom Cleansing Oil Capsules - 50 pcs,"I was worried about one capsule is not enough, but it’s actually bigger than I imagined! Smell like the cleansing balm. I deducted one star because the travel case can only hold one capsules per slot, I thought all the capsules could fit in."
MAKE UP FOR EVER-So Divine,Australia,excellent!,"This is by far my favourite makeup remover for a first cleanse. As someone with combination skin, I find the cleansing oil balms too oily. This is perfect! "

MAKE UP FOR EVER-So Divine,Australia,Mr,The name “So Divine” is very fitting indeed. Very effective product in removing heavier makeup/sunscreen and it smells really nice. Very good value for money - comes in a 150ml tube and you only need a grape-sized dollop for both face and neck.
MAKE UP FOR EVER-So Divine,,Miss,It’s a great makeup remover. Doesn’t dry out the skin. Just need to remember to be gentle when wiping it off. Super quick n easy removal of make up. I still follow with a gentle facial cleanser to finish 
MAKE UP FOR EVER-So Divine,,perfect,"I use this to remove my make up, included heavy makeup with mascara & eyeliner. I massage it on my whole face for few minutes. Feel so relaxing. This product smells cantaloupe. Then I wipe off the excess with a wet cotton and wash my face with cleanser. 
You will definitely won't feel dry or too oily.  Skin become soft afterwards.

"
DR.JART+-Ctrl-A Teatreement™ Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Why so smallllll,"Feels like my breakout wasn't that often when I was using this cleanser, but it could just be all in my mind. Just wished that the bottle could be bigger so it can last longer :)"
DR.JART+-Ctrl-A Teatreement™ Cleansing Foam,Singapore,good ,this improves my skin and leaves my skin feeling hydrated without stripping away the natural oils from my face . very gentle and comfortable on the skin . have been using daily 
DR.JART+-Ctrl-A Teatreement™ Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,cleanser,"this is the best afce cleanser i've tried so far. it is so good for combination/only skin like mine. It lasts me around 2-2,5 month, considering I wash my face twice a day. It is also very good for problematic skin. "
DR.JART+-Ctrl-A Teatreement™ Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,good ,Total in love with this product. definitely would repurchase this again. suitable for oily skin. would recommend this for those struggling with oily skin. 
DR.JART+-Ctrl-A Teatreement™ Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,awesome!,My skin felt really soft and not dry after I’m using this product. Because I have dry and combination kind of skin . This product suit well with my skin
DR.JART+-Ctrl-A Teatreement™ Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Still having doubts...,Maybe i just dont know how to foam it up properly. There was no foam at all no matter how hard i try to rub it on my hands first. But does a good job with cleansing my face. Doesnt felt too drying after washing. Been using it for more than a month but dont see any differences. 
DR.JART+-Ctrl-A Teatreement™ Cleansing Foam,Singapore,tea tree scent,This doesn’t break out my skin despite the fact that I have extremely sensitive skin. But nonetheless it does help with my scars. But it’s  a good everyday cleanser for sensitive skin. 
DR.JART+-Ctrl-A Teatreement™ Cleansing Foam,Singapore,nice smell,i used this as a 2nd wash. really helps with reduction in my acne. leaving a clean and refreshed feel on my face. and relaxing and calming tea tree oil smell.
DR.JART+-Ctrl-A Teatreement™ Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Good,Pricey but you gotta get the whole set in order to see the results. Bought it for my son who has hormonal acnes. Tip - get the whole set during sale. And put the toner in the fridge.
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Philippines,okay cleanser,This is a mild acne cleanser that won’t dry the skin but whose effects may be on the tame side. Don’t expect much and think that it will dry up your acne. But it cleans the face well but keeps the skin hydrated. 
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Singapore,great product ,I got really bad maskne and this really helped settle and soothe my skin. it's got a fresh smell and you only need a bit. this has lasted me ages too!
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Singapore,DEFINITELY WORTH IT!,This product is one of my go to cleansers and will forever be one I rave about.

DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Malaysia,Good cleanser,"Gel texture, not drying, good cleanser. Always accidentally squishing too much; would prefer it if it has a pump. "
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Philippines,Holy grail!,"I’ve been using this for years! It’s not irritating, no sting, and really does the job. It’s very consistent with keeping my face acne free. I used to buy it in-store but when pandemic hit, it was pretty difficult to acquire. I’m glad it’s on Sephora and it’s so easy and quick to order."
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Singapore,Love it!,"Love this, and i think the price is also not unreasonable, although it's not a very big product."
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Canada,Can handle period breakouts,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have used this face wash for more than 2 months and can genuinely say I love it. I  wanted to use it long enough to cycle through 2 or  more periods as every month my breakouts rate and time is different.  This has been an awesome addition to my facial routine.  It has helped tame my hormone-related acne and reduced the number of breakouts. It also helped with how long the acne stayed, as most went very quickly.  It  did not dry out my face after using and made my skin feel clean."
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Singapore,get the big size!,"got this before in the smaller size to try it out and liked it enough to come back for the big. really good for breakout-prone skin, nice smell"
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Canada,Dermalogica Clear Start Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash - 177ml,"i like this but not as much as i thought i did when i got it as a free sample. has a bit of a scent but i dont find it too overpowering, my skin feels clean and it’s not too harsh but i feel like it leaves my skin feeling a little stripped & dry, not as bad as some cleansers but not quite the right one for me.

also good size for the price"
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Singapore,pretty good ,I love I love how it Does not leave my skin dry I love how it Does not leave my skin dry I love how it Does not leave my skin dry how it Does not leave my skin dry I love how it Does not leave my skin dry
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Canada,Dermalogica Clear Start Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash - 177ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Absolutely adore this everyday face wash and will be changing my skincare routine from Cerave face wash to this one! This face wash always makes my skin feels so fresh after using it and it smells clean and nice, but nothing too strong. It also makes my skin, especially when I get pimples, appear less red."
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Canada,A 'yes' for sure,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I was gifted the cleanser for testing purposes. Previously, I used a foaming facial cleanser from drugstores so I had something to compare the cleanser to: it's very good for cleaning the face, if you spend a few minutes rubbing small circles all over your face, you can feel just how well the cleanser works and honestly it works as well as my favourite cleanser so that's very good.

The difference here is that first, this cleanser has a very practical bottle, and it's got SA to help with breakouts, which is very useful. As you can see in the pictures, the acne did heal a little although I was left with red spots, and while a cleanser is not enough to clear your breakouts (I was using my prescribed acne cream too), it's a great start to make sure that on the days I'm not using the cream, I still use an active ingredient to fight acne, which prevented the daily ""maskne"" from making my skin even worse (other than the occasional extra small pimples).

Definitely recommend along with other acne products, but for the cleanser part of the skincare regimen you use, I have to say this cleanser is essential!"
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Canada,Dermalogica Clear Start Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash - 177ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have been using this cleanser for the past two weeks and I have noticed a great difference in my skin! It leaves my skin feeling and looking clean without drying it out. I also like that it is fragrance-free, so it doesn't irritate my skin. A little bit goes a long way with this cleanser, so it'll be a staple in my skincare routine for a long time. I would definitely recommend this product!"

I have oily acne prone skin, and i enjoyed using this 2-3 times a week when i felt my skin getting congested. It has a really light fragrance that is pleasant and makes the experience feel nice! In terms of the results itself, my skin immediately felt clean and less congested. I couldnt use this everyday morning and night as my skin is very sensetive to fragrence, but i like having this to rotate with my other cleanser. I would take the travel size/mini on vacation as well! Overall would recommend you try it #giftedbydermalogica"

Would definitely recommend @dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica"
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Canada,Great cleanser!!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Great face wash for acne prone skin, I’ve seen my face clear up a lot and my pores are noticeably smaller. It feels super refreshing and clarifying. #giftedbydermalogica"
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Canada,A good start!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It's a good cleanser for acne prone skin but it made my skin a bit more dehydrated (note that I already have dry skin). However, this foaming wash helped to significantly reduce the size and appearance of my pimples and blackheads on my face."
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Canada,love!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) this is a very nice and gentle cleanser. it did a great job of cleansing my skin without overly stripping it. i like how it lathers and felt like it reduced my breakouts. with continuous use of the cleanser, i saw results in a few weeks."
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Canada,Good Cleanser for acne prone skin,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have been using this cleaner for approx a month now and it has been a good go to cleanser. It does emulsify once you start rubbing git in which is the best part! IT comes out white and is gel-like at first. This product worked well for my acne prone skin and did not break me out at all! That was the best part since I do have sensitive skin. I have seen tiny improvement in my skin as my pimples have decreased! Will def continue to use it. #giftedbydermalogica
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Canada,Expensive but Worth it,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Yes this cleanser is pricey but it is completely worth it. I have been having problems with acne since high school and every cleanser I used was a temporary fix, however, with this one I haven't seen any new white heads pop up on my cheeks, except for my chin. The cleanser has a nice citrus-y smell but not overpowering. It is a gentle cleanser but very powerful. For someone that uses makeup everyday, this has been my holy grail cleanser."
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Canada,Dermalogica Clear Start Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash - 177ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have been using this product for about a week now, and I have pretty bad acne on my face. 
First thing's first, this cleanser does have a bit of a scent to it, that may be irritating.

I haven't been using this product for too long, so I haven't seen any drastic changes, but I haven't had any new pimples or breakouts happen since I started using it. I like the consistency of this cleanser, and that it feels thick and not watered down. I'm going to keep using the cleanser, and hopefully in the long run I start to see more of a change!

This is a great simple face wash, it doesn’t have a strong scent and leaves my face looking and feeling extra clean. The salicylic acid really helped with the pimples I had and helped keep them away as well. There’s also a push to open button on the bottle that I really like because it keeps the product closed tight so water doesn’t get in when I leave the bottle in the shower

DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Canada,Face Looks & Feels Clean!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really liked this! I think this is great for helping acne prone skin. Its gentle on the skin and a little goes a long way. It is a tad more expensive than others on the market, but what makes this product stand out from other foaming washes I have tried, is the very light citrusy - lemon grass scent. The smell is not over powering and doesn't linger. I actually look forward to using this product because my face feels and smells very clean after using. @dermalogicacanada @sephoracanada #giftedbydermalogica"

I love this cleanser foaming wash I was chosen by dermalogica to try and test for free mainly u to get over dryness with other acne washes but this didn't.  Wow!!
It didn't dry out my skin and was gentle.
When I received it I was excited to use it.

I wet my face and take a drop of this cleanser, you really don't need much its cleared up my acne I'm on cloud nine so happy!!!!!!!

And i massage it on my face. It smells amazing, really fresh, i love using it in the morning cause it makes me feel awake.

My skin doesn't feel dry at all after using it, which is great!

And my face feels very fresh and clean.

I also love the packaging, very hygienic.

I just love this cleanser and don't have anything bad to say about it at all but only that it's amazing !!! I would recommend it to everyone, no matter what skin type you have but especially for acne.

DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Canada,Great cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I enjoyed this product a lot, it is not too harsh and does not have strong smell either. You need very little of the cleanser on your hands and then apply on the face. I find it is a little pricy for this  pretty small bottle but because it foams so well, I would consider buying it. It made my skin feel clean and  noticeable less breakouts.

DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Canada,Works great!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) @dermalogicacanada, @sephoracanada, #giftedbydermalogica I've been using this clearing foaming wash for almost two months. I have extremely sensitive acne prone skin and this is one of the face washes that doesn't give me harsh reactions. I really like how it's foaming as well since I feel like I can get a deeper clean. I think the BHA and salicylic acid definitely does the charm here; I have been noticing fewer breakouts despite using heavy foundation and concealer daily. It does have a slight scent, however, it is very light and natural. I recommend this product for those who have acne prone sensitive skin!"

DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Canada,Like most Foaming Cleansers,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This cleanser is pretty good at removing oils and leaving the skin feeling clean but it is a bit drying. I also would prefer if it was fragrance-free.

DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash,Canada,Good Acne Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Tried the Breakout Clearing Foaming Wash for the first time a few weeks ago for my daily acne breakouts. i use it daily, a.m + p.m. It has a very nice lemon grass scent. The scent really leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed. It helped prevent my regular daily acne but if you have under the skin, painful hormonal acne, then this may not be for you. It has a thick consistency and a little goes a long way. Overall, good as a daily cleanser to keep skin clean from impurities. @dermalogicacanada, #giftedbydermalogica"

He's got pimples all over his face and he's tried many different brands but none works, with some even worsened his condition.

I wish I had more positive things to say about thus chance but the ingredients left my face overly dry and a thin white cast that triggered me to pick up a beauty blender and put on foundation. I used the main 3 : foam wash, toner, moisturizer and I loved the foaming action (I have way too much fun washing my face).

Skin feels soft and supple after using it. It is pricey but a tub of this lasts a long time! Recommended for boys/men out there who is trying to start up a proper skincare routine with this moisturising cleanser.
SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,Great fragrance and it works,I do prefer this fragrance and I have used it for years. The cleanser is very creamy and is great to use either with your fingers or an electronic facial cleanser. The prices are brilliant on here as the item is on sale from time to time as well. It's usually best to order a few at a time.
SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,Superb quality,Bought this for my boyfriend. He like this men moisturising cleanser more better than the facial treatment cleanser. Compared with facial treatment cleanser this men cleanser more moisture and soft and even make his face brigher. There’s no brighten on his face when used facial treatment cleanser.

SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,Good,Product is good at controlling oil especially for my boyfriend who has acne breakouts and oily complexion. I have noticed that his face especially his forehead is matte now as compared to before. However he will still tend to have a few pimples here and there so maybe this is a little too drying. Will get the spf moisturiser from this series as well in hope of balancing things out.
SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,gentle cleanser for men,"I got this for my husband to try as he tends to have acne. While it doesn't cure acne, he loves the after-feel of the cleanser! I tried it myself and i think it  cleans well without drying the skin. This is the second tube i am getting from luxola :)"
SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,really moisturising..,this cleanser is kinda different from the SK-II gentle cleanser. This one is more moisturising and no flower scent :p Good for man though.. Skin feel soft after wash.. sometimes when i was lazy i can jz go to sleep directly after wash without apply the night time skin care.. lol..
SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,Fantastic cleanser - and not just for men!!,I am female and ordered this for myself because the standard version was sold out (at the time). It says that it is moisturising and I figured that my face could do with a little bit of moisturising because I'm awful about sticking to a cleanse-tone-moisturise routine. I am SO glad I got this as I actually prefer the scent of this to the regular one and my skin has embraced it wholeheartedly. :) 
SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,SKII Men - Moisturising Cleanser,I purchased this product for both my husband and my father. Both love it and it is especially value for money when Luxola has a 40% sale. They have gone through at least 6 tubes between the both of them. I would highly recommend it.
SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,Cleanser,"Its a good men cleanser, my boyfriend use it and he loves it.
He said he felt very clean after using it. So this more a squeaky clean cleanser instead of those moisturizing one. Purchase it during the 40% sale so it's a pretty good buy :) "
SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,Good cleanser,"Really good cleanser, but whether it is worth the extra dollar it is yet to be seen! It did not strip my skin completely which I totally love (used Kiehls cleanser before and it stripped my skin and made it very dry). I like the scent and a tube last for quite a long time (only need a bit each time). Overall I am happy. Trying the normal version (non-men version) and will compare."
SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,SK-II Men's Moisturising Cleanser,My hubby was using this clenaser and i did try few times and found it have a pleasent scent and moisturising effect. Personally i haven been using the SK-II gentle facial cleanser for few years now and decided to switch to this instead as i find both cleanser are having the same price.
SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,2nd time purchasing,This SK-II Cleanser received good feedbacks from the user therefore it's my second time purchasing this. Comes in quite a reasonable size and it can last a few months. Definitely will purchase this again after it runs out. 
SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,Basic Necessities,An absolute joy if you can get it during the luxola great discount period. Feels good to the skin. Cleans well. Definitely your day-to-day moisturizer cleanser :) I look forward for more varieties  of skii men products sold in the counter to be brought in to luxola.
SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,Sk2 men,"Great product after friends introduced me with gift set and now I am so addicted to it. i will suggest guys who never believed in facial products to try this however when you first start to use, do not use it too frequently, allow the skin to be adapt to it first before daily use."
SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,SKII for men,"It was a purchase for someone else, hence I don't really know if this product is good. However, SkII's reputation is trustworthy and the men's range shouldn't be that far off too I suppose! Worth trying this especially on their Cyber Monday sale! 40% off!!!"
SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,smooth facial cleanser,"Bought this for my bf when it was on 35% discount, so it was pretty worth it. Feedback so far is that the facial cleanser is pretty smooth, and works well with oily skin. It is pricey when there's no discount, but would recommend to try it during promotion."
SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,look authentic ,"i buy for my father and uncle during sale 35%off  with cash back 100 voucher 
skii quite famous for female skin care and should be quite good for men . Delivery was really fast and deliver timely .i will.buy more in future "
SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,Ideal cleanser for Men,"Looking for a nice facial cleanser for Men? Give a try on SK2 Men series. I make it into foam on my palm and wash my face in circular motion. After some massage and rinse off, very smooth, clean and refreshing feel. You will addicted to it."
SK-II-MEN Moisturizing Cleanser,,Best I have used,This cleanser is my absolute favourite amongst all that I have used. It cleans without feeling overly tight and it does not leave any sort of residue. Proctor and Gamble has created a product I would be sure to repurchase. Perfect for skin that is either normal or dry. Half a star down because of the price. 
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Malaysia,gentle on sensitive acne prone skin,The product ingredients are rather simple and minimalist. However it is a promising cleanser if you are looking for a gentle formula for your sensitive and acne prone skin.
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Australia,Amazing,"I had been using the AlphaH with Thyme and tried this one and it is even better on my skin, feels so smooth"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,"Yes girl, buy the cleanser!!","This product is a game changer for my skin! I'm a normal to oily girl, and this product has made my skin so clear. I get hormonal acne and I feel this cleanser is keeping my skin clear of blemishes. It's so nourishing too! I'm definitely a big fan of this product and highly recommend it!!"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Australia,excellent cleanser,This is probably my favourite product from Alpha H! My skin really feels cleanser after using. It’s very gentle on the skin and perfect for acne prone skin like mine! Would definitely buy this again! Perfect for daily use! And the bottle is really big! So it’s value for money! 
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Philippines,Meh,"Good thing I got the small bottle first. I used this once and I didn’t like it! Maybe it’s just me, but I personally don’t like lotion type cleansers. Would have to agree that it doesn’t feel stripping, but it also felt like it did not cleanse my face at all. It’s a bit pricey too. I can get a decent cleanser at the same cost. Try at your own risk!"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Australia,Miss,I have been trying to find a face cleanser that doesn’t make my skin feel tight and horrible. This is the holy grail. I feel cleansed and no tightening afterwards so I would defs  recommend if you’re looking for something that doesn’t make your skin feel rly tight. 
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,surprisingly awesome,"I was shocked that this product worked. I tried it on a recommendation from a friend and it didn’t feel like it was scrubbing anything off me, but it did! It got 100% of my makeup off in the shower and left my skin feeling more hydrated. Absolutely stunned that it worked so well!"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,luxurious!!!!,"Besides the tatcha rice water cleanser I have never repurchases a cleanser more than once. Until I found this cleanser, first of all it’s HUGE. The bottle and amount of product you get is completely worth the money. The next is the texture, it’s unlike any cleanser I have used. It feels so hydrating but also feels like my skin is clean. My skin has actually improved since using this cleanser. I cannot say enough good things about this cleanser. For reference my skin type is dry and dehydrated with hormonal break outs and dark spots from post acne scars."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Malaysia,gentle cleanser,this is a very gentle cleanser. however it doesn't foam much. almost doesn't lather that well. so might need extra product in your hand for a wash. but it's very gentle and doesn't leave skin dry
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Malaysia,not bad,"I like that it has little to no fragrance. Your skin feels soft after cleaning, not too squeaky. Feels fresh and clean without stripping off too much oils. "
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,My new favorite cleanser hands down. I’ve been searching for a non foaming cleanser forever. ( I just think they clean better than getting suds all over the place) and here comes Alpha-H with the best non foaming cleanser ever! After the first washing my skin looked smooth and had rosy cheeks without rubbing. My wife was like “ Are you wearing makeup?” I laughed and said no it’s this new cleanser I bought. She’s sold now too. Guess we’ll have to share!
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Versatile cleanser truly providing balanced skin,"I love the versatility of this cleanser with it’s a lotion-like consistency- I use it on dry skin, as a second cleanse or even as a 5 minute mask. I can feel the aloe vera working to sooth my dry/combination skin after every use, without that tight feeling after you dry off, and my skin tone is looking more even and balanced. Even though the unique lotiony consistency and price tag are a little alarming (and also very few ingredients!?) I would totally recommend this to someone with any skin type in need of a simple soothing cleanser. I’ve been reaching for this product more and more often during the cold months where I’m looking to get hydrating benefits from every product in my routine"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Australia,Calming for my Acne,Helped to reduce my excess oil production and soothe the redness to my breakouts. Great to use twice a day as my skin felt so soft and smooth afterwards. Great as a first cleanse then a scrub afterwards 
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Singapore,non foamy cleanser but still does its job,This cleanser is quite light and suitable for sensitive / combi skin like mine. I suggest using non foamy cleanser with foreo or a cleansing tool to throughly cleanse your skin :)
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,"So gentle and moisturizing! This light, fluffy creamy formula never strips my skin or leaves it feeling unclean. It really did exactly what it says - balanced my skin! I have oily, acne prone skin that I use benzoyl peroxide on regularly. It tends to leave my skin dry or flaky but when I use this cleanser in combination with that, it absolutely helps balance my skin and helped keep the barrier in check."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Australia,Best Cleanser I've ever used!,"I've tried slot of cleaners...like 50...and this is hands down my favourite for my dry and acne prone skin. Simply gorgeous texture and scent, it cleanses well and your skin feels so soft afterwards thanks to the Vitamin E and aloe vera. Highly recommend!!!"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Australia,Love!,"I love this cleanser. Have already repurchased and will continue to do so! It’s really light and leaves my skin feeling clean and hydrated. My cheeks get dry from heavy cleansers, but this isn’t drying at all"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Australia,Pretty good for a gentle exfoliant,I'm used to stronger formulas but this is great if you're introducing chemical exfoliants into your routine. Smell is fine and works well to slough off dead skin. 
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Malaysia,alpha h balancing cleanser,This alpha h balancing cleanser is a cream cleanser which is best to use for my night routine. It contains aloe vera which can hydrates your skin and make it feel smooth. Pair it with its moisturizer for best result
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Australia,good cleanser!,A lovely silky smooth product that is very good for the skin. Very gentle and would cleanse the skin very well. Never made skin red and smelt lovely. 
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Singapore,never again,"I think this would work well if you have sensitive skin AND don't wear much makeup. this thing does not foam. I had to squeeze a bigger dollop onto my palm to make my face feel clean, and mind you i don't use much makeup, just powder and mascara. "
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Malaysia,Good Cleanser,it is like a creamy face cleanser. face feels clean and fresh after wash. it is gentle and do not give me any irritation. gonna buy full size after this. 
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,not the best,"This didn’t feel like it was cleaning my skin i had to use a scrubbing pad for my face to actually feel as it was cleaning. It also stung my face a little when i would use it, i thought i could switch to this cleaners but the inky list oat cleanser was much better price and did the beat job."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Worked well!,"I received this for free from Influenster and was so excited to give it a try. I use a full face of makeup daily so taking it off isn’t always that fun. But this definitely made it easier. I used it at night before going to bed to take the day off. It’s a super creamy formula and has a very mild light scent to it. I lathered it up with some water and it applied it all over my face. It didn’t get my eye makeup so easily but I wasn’t surprised since that’s the most stubborn to take off. But after lathering up a second time, it took everything off. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this did not irritate my skin in any way. I would definitely recommend!"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,"It’s great for sensitive skin. It didn’t break me out, and removed and melted my makeup instantly. I pump a little on a cotton pad and after applying water to my face, it wipes all my makeup off. Bonus it’s not drying at all!"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Great cleanser,"After Applying one pump of cleanser onto a dampened face I noticed it removed my make up easily and it didn’t dry my skin . 
After usage i apply moisturizer . Can be used during day or night."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Give it a try,I loved this wash. I received it free to try and it didn’t disappoint. With my skin any new change makes me break out this did not. It has the texture of lotion. Goes on smooth. It does not lather up like a face wash. Leaves the skin feeling smooth and refreshed. I am not one to wash my face in the morning however with this I have been and have noticed my skin feeling smooth. I wear two different mask at work and this I feel has kept my face hydrated so that I don’t break out from my N95. I recommend for anyone to try I have combination type skin
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H balancing cleanser,I love this cleanser! Especially for at night when you’re so tired. You put it on your face then wipe it off. It is very creamy. I wish it was more like a balm or a cleanser. This has the consistency of a lotion. It does the job and gets makeup off so well. Would definitely purchase!
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,"i love this cleanser! it’s creamy and full, smells amazing, and you can feel the tingle of the aha. i like that you can decide how long to leave it on to up the intensity of the tingle. seriously - it smells SO good. fruity and light and calming. highly recommend, it’s similar to murad’s aha, but better. love this product!"

ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Smoothing and softening,"This cleanser is pretty good. My skin did look and feel smooth and soft after the first use. I haven't tried it as a makeup remover yet, as I'm not wearing makeup often since masks are worn everywhere. My skin is pretty sensitive however and prone to acne if I don't double cleanse with something with benzoyl peroxide in it. I also prefer a cleanser to be mildly exfoliating, which this is not. It's not a bad cleanser, but my skincare needs are specific and I have a good system down, so I don't see it replacing my staples."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Would purchase again!,"I loved this cleanser. It’s not harsh like my cleansers in the past so I thought it wasn’t working at first. After a month of use, my skin is clear and moisturized even in this cold winter!!"

It effectively removes the makeup and residue from the day leaving my skin feeling refreshed. I really like the creamy texture of the face wash, and the packaging is nice too."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Works great,My skin was in serious need of serious help after this gnarly winter we've had.  In comes Alphahskincare with a balancing cleanser with aloe vera to the rescue.It gentle enough to not disrupt my sensitive skin but tough enough to remove all traces of makeup even waterproof.I love that it's non-greasy even though it has nourishing vitamin e and aloe so it leaves my skin smooth but not shiny. It doesn't dry out or irritate my skin which is a major plus.  My face feels refreshed and looks more evenly toned after a few weeks of use. It also makes my skin feel hydrated after use and lasts all day.The bottle is a generous 6.25 fl. oz so it should last a while . Overall really happy with how well this awesome cleanser works.
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Just okay,"I really wanted to like this cleanser, but after 4 weeks of use, it just wasn’t doing it for me. I never felt like it cleaned my face very well, even after double cleansing. I have sensitive skin and redness concerns and I never felt like it reduced the redness."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,"I love this cleanser! It’s great for my sensitive skin, have had no reactions, and is nice and clean smelling."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Love It!,"I honestly wasn’t expecting to like this product because initially, the consistency was similar to another cleanser I bought and didn’t care for. This stuff is AMAZING, I have come to find out. The consistency is creamy and soft without leaving an oily film over your skin after rinsing it off. It also smells mild, yet refreshing and clean. This is the cleanser I use after a makeup free day because I feel like it’s not going to dry out my skin. Overall, this is an amazing product and it makes my skin feel so clean after each use."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Must buy now!!,This cleanser is the real deal! I love how fresh and clean my skin feels afterwards! There’s no residue that lasts afterwards. I feel completely refreshed and that it takes all of my makeup and dirtiness off from the day. I highly recommend it! Never have I purchased a cleanser so amazing! I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest and real opinion.
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Good,"I like this product. It is a soft Cleanser that remove dirty from your face, even makeup and leave your skin so soft because of the Aloe that it has in the ingredients. The only thing I don't like it is when you use it everyday it feels more as cream than a cleanser but overall a great product"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,"I got this in a box to review. I like the gentle formula and that it gets all my makeup off. It’s a great cleanser and I will continue to use morning and night. It doesn’t strip my face, but keeps it the right clean feel. I really enjoy it."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,"I loved this product ! I found this cleanser so easy to use. It’s feels like a face mask , it’s such a great cleanser."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Australia,rashes and acne,"It felt nice to use, but it made my skin break out in nasty acne and rashes. My skin isn’t overly sensitive so I was surprised that a gentle cleanser would have this effect"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,One of my new favorite fave cleaners!,I have normal to dry skin and this is perfect for me! Its an amazing creamy formula that cleanses my skin and dulls out the redness and helps with dryness by moisturizing deep into my pores. Also has a lovely soothing and calming effect. The bottle is huge so it lasts a long time! Plus a little goes a long way! My skin is absolutely glowing. It's Insanely smooth after washing my face and neck with it. You can see not just feel the physical effects but can see a visible difference too! Highly Recommend!
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Soft and Clean Skin,"I loved this product!! Firstly, the packaging is so nice. It’s really aesthetically pleasing on my bathroom shelf. I also love that it is recyclable. 

I found this cleanser so easy to use. It massages in to the skin really well. It feels like a face mask and is very easy to wash off.

It left my skin feeling so soft and squeaky clean. I found myself excited to use it every day. I will definitely be buying this again and am excited to try their other products."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,One of my favorite cleansers!,"This is my very first Alpha-H product, their Balancing Cleanser with Aloe Vera. This cleanser is described as a gentle, creamy lotion that removes makeup while balancing the skin. There are no AHAs in this formula. This cleanser has an extremely mild scent (parfum is last on the ingredient list) but I find that it’s a very comforting scent. This can be used as the first or second cleanser in your double cleanse routine - I used it as both and here’s my experience:⁣⁣
⁣⁣
This cleanser is as described, gentle, creamy, and has a lotion texture. The concept reminds me of the Pond’s Cream Cleanser but this is way more effective and easier to deal with. As a first cleanse, it effectively removes makeup without irritation. You won’t really have to “work it in” or “warm it up” for it to do its job. You won’t have to tug at the skin either. This formula makes you want to massage your face . If you like cleansing balms, you will like this. As a second cleanse, I find it gentle enough to cleanse and it doesn’t strip your skin of its natural oils or leave your skin feeling tight. This honestly quickly became one of my favorite cleansers once I saw it in action. It rinses off easily and does not leave any type of film on your face. I just love it 
⁣⁣
There’s not much else I can say about this because cleansers are very straight forward to me. Does it work, yes or no? Is it gentle, yes or no? Does it irritate my skin or eyes, yes or no? Does it make me want to clean my face after a drunken night, yes or no? If all these things check out, I’M A FAN!⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Thank you to Alpha-H and Influenster for gifting and allowing me to try this cleanser out. What a great introduction and first impression to the brand!⁣⁣"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Does not remove makeup,"Initially I thought this was 5 stars because it feels like lotion but functions as a cleanser, hiwrver, this does not remove makeup snd I definitely had to double or triple cleanse to do the job. The size is great, love the look, def gentle and great smell."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,I like it but it’s not a very good product for my oily skin type! I love how simple it is and how clean it gets your skin but I just need a product for my specific oily skin and ridiculous acne!
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Hydration and Cleansing all-in-one,"I received this product free for testing purposes through Influenster and I must say that it is a great hydrating cleanser. Alot of cleansers can leave your skin feeling stripped and dry but Alpha-a gets rid of all the built up gunk from the day, whole still leaving your skin feeling supple and hydrated."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Yesssss,"I received this product to review from Influenster and I’m so glad I did! It’s such a great cleanser. It doesn’t leave my skin dry or tight, have left no offensive fragrance and lathers up nicely! I will keep buying!"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Good gentle cleanser- not good for makeup removal,This product is good as a gentle cleanser but it does not remove makeup advertised.
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Removes even the toughest mascara,"I seriously love when Sephora sends me products to try and I just ran out of my previous face cleaner so was super excited to try this. A big issue I have with my cleaner is it doesn’t remove my mascara at all and I’m stuck trying to get it off. This creamy cleanser is like a lotion and so moisturizing but it does a fabulous job at removing ALL your makeup. There was barely any residue when I wiped my face with a towel and it removed all of my mascara without any harsh wiping or rubbing. My face felt clean, soft, and moisturized after; This is definitely a winner for me!!!"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Good to use at the sink,"I like this cleanser I received complimentary from Influenster but I can’t use it in the shower. If I use it to wash my face in the shower, I feel like there is grease or oil still on my face. At the sink if works nicely because I can dry my face right away. I would recommend if you’re a mostly sink face-washer."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Hydrating cleanser,This is a great cleanser. I love that it does not dry my skin out but does a great job cleaning. I use it ever night before bed and have not had any issues. I highly recommend it.
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Love this cleanser!,"Creamy, moisturizing product with no obvious or offensive scent. Left skin feeling very clean, but not tight or dry.  Skin feels fresh and nourished!"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,"This cleanser hits the mark. It gentle enough for my dry skin. However, it also effective enough to remove all my makeup and cleanse (with face cloth or Clarisonic) that I don’t need a second cleanse. It really has a nice balance (no pun intended )."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,So soothing!,This cleanser is so beautifully made. It doesn’t irritate my super sensitive skin and the smell is so light and pleasant. The amount of product you get is absolutely worth the price you pay. I can’t wait to try for products from this brand.
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,Really like the gentle cleansing and clarifying AlphaH brings... very creamy and mild! Also love that it doesn’t make my skin feel stripped of natural oils. I just wish it didn’t contain fragrance!
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,"I really liked this product, it is a cleanser with a good aroma and leaves your skin soft, it feels very natural and not abrasive to the skin, I really recommend it!!"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,Honestly I was a little iffy about trying this or thought it wouldn’t work so well removing make up but it actually works wonders and it leaves ur skin so soft and I was honestly really surprised on how well it didn’t remove but I did have to add a bit more then the amount suggested Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,"Great morning cleanser! I love that it’s super creamy and leaves my skin feeling clean. It’s not super aggressive or foamy so if that’s what you are looking for this may not be for you. I like that my skin doesn’t feel irritated or look red after a wash, which is something I get with most cleansers. I do think you get a generous amount for the price."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Best Cream Cleanser I’ve tried,I’ve only ever tried a few cream cleansers and they don’t work so I haven’t been a fan of them until I tried this one. I had very low expectations but this worked perfectly! It removed not only my foundation and bronzer but also all of my eye makeup including mascara and eyeliner. When I rinsed off my face actually felt nice and clean.  I will continue using this
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,Product has little scent and is very easy on my combination skin. After use my skin feels super clean without being too dry. A little bit goes a long way.
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,"I really like this cleanser a lot! It leaves my skin feeling gently cleansed and does not strip away my top layer of moisture, so I never feel dry after using this. It’s great and the scent is very very light."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Great for all skin types!,"Like most people, skincare can be tricky to find one that works. THIS cleanser is perfection. My skin is dry and this is a non-irritating and non-greasy face wash. It clears all makeup and isn't over drying. I can't recommend this enough!"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Good cleanser with a moisturizer touch,"Good cleanser. I have used it for about a week and feel that it has helped to keep my skin moist. I didn’t feel like it removed the make up. I needed to use something else to clean all the make up, and then I used this cleanser. Good for dry skin."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,This is fantastic!!!,"Wow! I’m SO impressed!!! I love the smell and texture, option to wipe off or wash off, and omg the end result? Clean, fresh skin....my friend was visiting and I was like “Girl touch much face!!!! Where are my pores?!?!?” Absolutely amazing! Go get this! Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser THANKS INFLUENSTER!!! Complimentary sample from Influenster"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Not much of a difference,"It has a nice texture when you apply it to the skin, it almost feels like it doesn't really get deep in the pores though. I have sensitive skin with dry patches and it doesn't irritate me. I'm still not 100% on the cleanser itself. Texture and scent wise its nice but i feel like other products will really get your skin clean."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,My skin was too sensitive I guess,I like the smell and my face felt clean yet moisturized after on the first use on a makeup free face. I used it again to take makeup off and not all of the makeup came off. Also my face broke out a little after the second use. I am looking forward to trying other products from this company though!
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Moisturizing & Refreshing,"I really like the amount of product you get, I’ll say that first. The cleanser is more of a lotion, so it doesn’t foam up. I like that it doesn’t get super foamy though, usually those kinda of cleansers dry my skin out. It does a pretty good job at cleansing but it does a GREAT job at hydrating. The smell is pretty tame, the best way I can describe it is a “spa smell”. It’s very light & clean."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Love it,We received this as a free testing product and my daughter absolutely loves it! It’s soft and gentle on sensitive skin. It’s not drying at all!
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,"If you need to get rid of some texture, discoloration or anything of that sort. Give this a try. Not for sensitive skin though. Could be a bit much."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,LOVE,I really love this cleanser! It is very gentle on the face! It feels soft and leaves skin feeling soft and hydrated!
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Cleansing without drying!,I love this cleanser! It gently cleans off my makeup and grime without over drying. There’s no strong scent in my opinion. I can’t sit to try more of Alpha-H products!
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,This feels so good on the skin. It felt amazing. It definitely doesn’t leave your skin dry. I don’t have to immediately put moisturizer on my skin. I’m glad they sent me this because now this made me want to look into their other skincare products.
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,"I am shocked that I liked this more than I thought I would! It’s a creamy, lotion-like texture and it doesn’t lather much but it feels nice and on the skin. I hate when cleansers leave your face feeling tight and dry. This did not do that! It was moisturizing and my face felt very clean! *I received this product for free from Influenster*"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,"I just received this amazing product  and 
I really like it ., It cleans  all makeup off  from my skin. As I have combination skin I need a delicate balance of hydration and removing excess oil. My skin feels so good . I will repurchase again for sure! @alphahskincare &#sephoraxalohah"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Singapore,Interesting,"it's my first time using a facial cleanser that doesn't foam up. felt a little weird initially as it felt like it didn't clean my face. however, after washing it off, my skin feels amazing and very moisturising indeed. need to squeeze a bit more product than other cleanser so this is a little on the pricier side. but amazing for dry skin!!"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Malaysia,Awesome cleanser,I'll give it a five. it works well for my dry skin. My skin feels soft and non stripping after every wash. So gentle yet effective. definitely will repurchase 
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,New Zealand,Great Cleanser,"Very good cleanser & for the price, you definitely get a good amount of product. It's not drying & it leaves my face feeling super clean (I have dry skin)"

ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Singapore,Clean and Mild Texture ,This cleanser is suitable for dry skin as it is highly hydrated! The scent is good! It is not too dry for your skin and it removes light make up too! No bubbles!

ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Huge fan!,Huge fan of this cleanser!!! I have sensitive yet combo skin and this keeps my skin clear without over drying plus it’s not greasy at all. It kind of feels like it at first but once you rinse and pat dry you’ll feel your skin absorb the moisturize. My skin is so soft from this and the aloe helps soothe. I previously used the fresh soy cleanser and Boscia makeup breakup oil (which btw are also fantastic products) but this is an all-in-one cleanser and it makes my skin care routine easier  and less time consuming
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Not so great for me,I didn’t realize that this is more of a lotion rather than a cleanser so you have to wipe it off with a damp cloth. It doesn’t feel like it’s cleaning. I didn’t even take my eyeshadow off.
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,I have very sensitive skin and this is super calming on my skin. I have atopic dermatitis and it works great!
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Singapore,Just Ok,No major complaints but no major raves either for this cleanser. It doesn't leave your skin feeling too dry. Does a decent job of removing makeup. Best I can say is that it's functional. What I do appreciate however is that the brand clearly indicates on the tube that there are no AHAs/BHAs in the cleanser. Good info for consumers who may otherwise overuse acidic cleansers.
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Malaysia,All Purpose! ,"Without a doubt one of my favourite all time cleansers. The texture is velvety smooth on skin, and most importantly thoroughly removes makeup and is the perfect follow up product to double cleanse."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Singapore,30ml is too little! ,The 30ml one is really too little and not worth it unless you want to try the item. I have used this before but didn’t expect the 30ml to be so little. Disappointed! 
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Australia,best cleanser I’ve found!,"I’ve been using this cleanser for about 6 months now, and it’s the only one on the market I’ve found that consistently gives me clear skin regardless of what time of the month it is. My skin is sensitive and this leaves it feeling smooth and fresh. "
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Australia,Fantastic cleanser,"I’ve been purchasing this cleanser for years and I love it! It’s creamy and feels so lovely on the skin. It has a very light fragrance and helps make your skin feel refreshed and clean, without stripping away the oils in your skin. Alpha H make fantastic products! I’d recommend this cleanser to all skin types, as it is very gentle. "
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,Australia,Amazing Cleanser ,"Repeat buyer here, I LOVE this cleanser. Pleasant subtle smell, creamy feel and gentle on the skin. Face feels clean, fresh and soft after use. I have extremely sensitive skin and often struggle to find products that don’t irritate me, I find this very calming. "
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,,absolute fave,This leaves my skin feeling so clean and refreshed. I use it of a morning and night and it so luxurious to use and really calming on the skin! This is my favourite cleanser I have ever found and I never thought I would love a cream cleanser so much as I usually prefer foaming. 
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,,Gentle Cleanser,"This cleanser is gentle and effective, perfect if you need to cleanse more than once a day.  I wouldn't say I've seen improvement since my last cleaner (First Aid Beauty) but its on par results wise and much nicer to use."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,Didn’t know I was going to love this stuff so much. Genuinely think this has kept my skin in really good condition and I do not want to be without it!
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Gentle and effective,I have dry skin and this was super gentle and effective without irritating my skin.
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,,I think this cleanser has saved my skin,"My first impression wasn't great. It's a very gentle cream cleanser and didn't give me the feeling of super cleansed skin that I usually like. However, since using this, my skin has not broken out how it used to and I think this cleanser might be the reason. I will definitely buy this again!"
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,"low ph cleaner, must have for vitamin C","This cleaner is a game changer for me for my skin care routine. I never cared about ph level before and this totally elevated everything I do now. If you use vitamin C in it's most effective form, which is L ascorbic acid, you must try to use a low ph cleaner before hand to alter your skin's natural ph to a low 3.5 for the C to work properly. It also makes any chemical exfoliator more effective as well. I went through years without caring about ph, and now that I'm more aware, it has made a huge difference in the product orders in my routine. I use this alpha H in the mornings when I do vitamin C and AHA/BHA. I'll use a 5.5 ph neutral cleanser for evenings when I use retinol."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,USA,Alpha-H Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera - 185ml,"Gentle cleanser,  leaves skin feeling moisturized. Non irritating and doesn’t strip natural moisture."
ALPHA-H-Balancing Cleanser With Aloe Vera,,No.1 Cleanser,This has been my go to cleanser for the last 2 years. It’s super gentle on my skin and great to double cleanse with to remove makeup. Doesn’t leave skin feeling tight or stripped of natural oils. 
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,Singapore,2 in 1 Cleansing Foam,"Love it ! ,This cleansing foam does work deep cleaning. I feel like a little bit dry after face wash.So I recommend you should apply toner or lotion after your cleansing."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Smoooth and radiance ! ,"I really like this cleanser but why 4.5 star? I think the price if more affordable will be 5 stars from my side ! After using it’s not tightened my face and I feel smooth and glowing on my face , good for dullness skin. "
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,USA,Estée Lauder Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,"The actual face wash feels good on my skin and I definitely feel that it gave my skin more of a natural glow to it, but after I wash it off my skin feels like there’s a thin film left on it, almost like a residue after its completely washed off. Other than that, it’s a very good product."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Just so so ,I heard a lot about this cleansing foam so that I decided to give it a try. I have combination to oily skin. It’s not suitable for my skin. I don’t feel comfortable after washing. It’s drying out my skin. 
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,Canada,Washing never felt so good!,"I’ve been using this product for years now, and have found no other cleansing foam like it on the market. I appreciate that this product can be left on the face for a few minutes to give the skin a real ‘deep’ clean when desired. A very small amount goes along way, and I find it works great on other parts of the body as well. If you have combo/oily skin, I highly recommend this cleanser as it will make your skin feel refreshed day and night without that over drying feeling."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,USA,Estée Lauder Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,This is absolutely my all time favorite cleanser. It’s great as a daily cleanser and works even better as a mask. It leaves the skin feeling fresh and clean without drying it out.

ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Nothing special ,"This is nothing special for the price, I feel that I get a better wash with other cheaper products. "
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,USA,Doesn't remove makeup,"I had high hopes given there were many positive reviews and high price for regular face cleanser, but this is very subpar product and doesn't clean properly or even remove make up residues from your eyes after mascara. I look like a raccoon trying to wash hard with this cleanser (although it does foam good and not harsh-more like a creamy) and my under eyes still have black after several washes. Such a waste. I had to wash my face with other Murad product after it to remove leftovers... Face doesn't even feel clean. And honestly scent not that great, smells chemicals. I would not recommend this. I prefer Shiseido White Lucent Brightning Foam Cleanser Face wash to this one million times."

ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Best cleanser,"Been using this cleanser for many years now. Does the trick to remove residue expecially make up, but advisable to double cleanse for waterproof makeups. Excellent product"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,Singapore,bought this for my sister,"Bought this for my sister, she really loves this cleanser, she said she is sticking to this cleanser.. smell great, feels squeky clean, does not cause breakout to the skin.. giving it 4 stars as it is quite expensive"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,USA,Estée Lauder Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,Love this cleaning foam. It leaves your skin glowing and fresh. Not too harsh and has a very light smell to it.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,USA,Disappointed,"This product has mostly 4-5 stars reviews, so I ordered a full size. After all, it is a cleansing product, and most of the brands do pretty well on these, so I thought that EL one would be definitely a safe choice. However, I am rather disappointed with this purchase :( It washes your face to squeaky feeling and I find it weird: it immediately makes you think that your skin was just stripped of any protective layers it had (like after a drugstore soap bar). To be fair, for sure, it's more gentle to the skin than the soap bar. However, it absolutely can't be used in the eye area because it dries out the eye area very badly: I could see all the texture after using it, even the texture I didn't think I had. So I don't think I can use it as a face wash because I do like cleaning my eye area and using 2 face washes at a time is nonsense. I will try using the product further as a facemask, however, I don't think it really does anything significant: any clay mask might give the same benefits, honestly. On the bright side, it smells like nothing (very subtle soapy-creamy scent) so is probably a good option for smell-sensitive people. Wouldn't be buying again."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,Singapore,fast delivery ,I’ve been hearing reviews from friends about how good this product is & im so delighted to receive it.

ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,o.m.g,"i feel obliged to leave a review for the first time since this is the.best.so.far .. I've tried other bestselling products like Fresh, Gamglow n PTR (i dont know if I'm allowed to mention other brands here), but this is by far the best for my skin.. after long day at work or traveling, my face tends to be congested, appeared dull n oily, but using this it leaves my skin squeaky clean without really drying it..within only 1week of use, my face looks brighter (to be clear, i recently changed my skincare regimen with different faceoil as well) .. o.m.g"

ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Mask facial foam,"My skin type is combination, large pores on the nose. This cleanser texture was so smooth and creamy. Especially when you lather with water and rub on ur face. I can feel it cleans well only on the surface to the extent I can feel tightness on my face at times. It smells good, like berries? Hahaha. I haven’t see any radiant effect perhaps due to my skin considered fair. It causes tingling sensation when I used it, not everytime but frequently. I believe is due to a few acid ingredients on the product. Overrall, I feel it is a slightly above average kind of facial foam. My favourite part about it is, I can use it as a 2 minutes mask! But the con part about this cleanser is, it doesn’t work well with acne and blackheads. My acne last a week plus and came another.  Ladies with sensitive skin definitely not suitable for this. "
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,and,Bad customer service! I ordered item from Sephora with free gift. After 2 days told me that no stock for the gift. And said:”Even if it has been added on your cart it doesn't mean that it will be really in stock since it will still be processed at the warehouse.” Cheating company!

Apply amount of it on the dry face without damping it, then massage my face for a few seconds. Add moist gradually, keep massaging. If you have Foreo Luna, you can use it as well.

Its very effective at cleaning deeply while also maintaining skin moisture! However, I personally need something a bit more hydrating for my second and morning cleanse. Another cleanser I will repurchase for days that I need a deep clean without the worry of stripped skin. Antioxidant rich, Soothing, Lightly foaming and goes a long way. Wonderful cleanser all around. Worth the cost as the ingredients are premium, formulation is beautiful and can last at least 4-6 months with daily use."

ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,USA,awesome!,"I currently work for Estèe Lauder, so I use all their products. I found this cleanser after a school I attended a few weeks ago. I was using the perfectly clean face wash, with decent results, but I still found my face to be oily and more likely to have breakouts. But After using the sample I recieved at the school, I fell in love with it, and bought the full size as soon as I could get to the store!! My face has completely done a 360, I have no oil, and my breakouts have ceased! I pledge to lauder products!! This is by far my favorite face wash/mask! I will recommend to everyone! **also try the moisturizer, with advanced night repair as your serum***"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,USA,"Decent Cleanser, Doesn’t Remove Makeup Well","It helps my skin to feel clean and refreshed, but I wouldn’t say it makes it anymore radiant or glowy. I’ve had this product for a good month.

I will say that it doesn’t get full marks due to the fact that it takes three washes to remove makeup. I don’t wear full faces, and usually do touch ups and maybe some highlighter—so it’s not much product. For the amount of product that I have to use to cleanse, I wouldn’t say it justifies the price."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,,it can be a mask too,i just want to give it a go as i want to try another foam cleanser to replace my korean range. less foaming which i like. never try as a mask yet but i believe it is going to be a space friendly during travel. 
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,USA,great for normal skin,"My skin is normal-dry and I've been using this for about 2 months. I received a smaller size from my grandmother, would never buy it for myself due to the price.

But it's soooo gooooood. It didn't dry out or irritate my skin,it didn't break me out at all. My skin is better than it has been in over a year. It has a nice citrus scent, lovely for the morning. Works better as a wash than a mask, imo. 

If I could actually afford this i would use it forever."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,USA,YES!,My skin tends to be on the dry side due to medication and the cold weather.

It got rid of my texture, it keeps my skin feeling clean and refreshed! What I do love about this cleanser is it doesn’t make your skin feel dry after using like many cleansers do ! It leaves a clean & glowy base !"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,USA,Estée Lauder Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,"This product feels creamy and leaves my skin soft.  I agree with other reviewers that it doesn't do a great job of removing make up, especially mascara and eyeliner. I'm an older woman and don't use much makeup, so this would be a real problem if you use a lot. I'll be looking for something else when I've finished the full size I purchased."

If you have dry skin dont waste your money"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,USA,O-M-G!!!,"Listen this product gives me so much life no other cleanser can compare!!!!

I went through a ""let's get serious"" about skincare phase and it was too much too fast because so many different product combos nearly distorted my beautiful face. I nearly cried from how bad my break out was and I couldn't pin point what the heck was causing it. Long story short I return all the products sooo many people seemed to rave over on Instagram and YouTube and went with the brand that has never failed be in the past. BOOM!!!! It was like facial crack over night my breakout had disappeared like if it never existed. 

I love how smooth it applies to your face, the scent is amazing and not overbearing, it's a freaking two in one for Christ sake!!!! And my face has never felt so clean and vibrant. I usually apply it to my face as a mask first and then apply water and cleanse I feel like I get a deeper clean that way. 

Give it a try trust me you can go wrong especially if you want that fleeky glow in the am!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,USA,"Not effective, slippery feeling on skin :/","This didn't work for me. I do have dry skin, maybe that's part of it. For me, my makeup isn't entirely removed with this, so i have to use multiple removers. Also, my skin feels too slippery after, almost stripped. Some people enjoy this, but it really wasn't a good feeling for me."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,USA,IN LOVE,"Always looking for a good cleanser to pair with my clarisonic and this one is perfect. It leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed and has a nice cooling sensation when applied. Unlike other foaming cleansers this one doesn't go all over the place when you rub it in which is a plus for me, it foams just a little and you don't have to use much product. For $30 this is 10000000% a repurchase!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,USA,Repeat buyer!,I love this cleanser and I have purchased it on Sephora as well as the Estee Lauder website. It helps balance out my face and it cleanses great. Will repurchase it again.

ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy 2-in-1 Cleansing Foam,USA,Cleanser For Dry Skin,"I have dry skin but I hate using milky cleansers because I feel like my face is still dirty afterwards. However, most foaming cleansers leave me dry.

This one didn't...and I washed my face with lukewarm water -which usually tends to dry me out more. This left my face fresh and soft, no tightness or flakiness. Don't know if I would say my face was ""radiant"" but it definetely looked clean and fresh - which I was very happy with. I did follow up with a moisturizing toner though - Black Tea Toner from Fresh. So my face felt extra comfortable.

This foams very well, but doesn't drip off your face, a little goes a long way, about a pea amount will give you a rich lather.

Will definitely work with Clarisonic - will probably make your face feel EXTRA clean.

Smells really good, kind of a mix between floral and fruity. Not overpowering at all. Just enough to enjoy washing your face.

Since this was such a success for me, I'm looking forward to trying the entire line."

DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,Canada,Best Foaming Cleanser,"This cleanser has quickly become my new favorite. I prefer foaming cleansers over non foaming cleansers so trying this one was a treat. It has a pleasantly mild lavender scent which I adore. It does a great job of cleaning my skin without stripping it or making it feel dry. You can tell that Dermalogica chose ingredients to add to this cleanser that would be gentle yet effective. I use this AM and sometimes PM and I never have any issue with my skin drying out. Another thing that is important to mention is that this cleanser is cruelty-free, vegan, sulfate-free, and has recyclable packaging (among other things.)"

DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Special Cleansing Gel,"I’ve been using this for about a year now and can’t say enough great things. Try it! A bottle lasts a long time, I love the powder- it’s also the best for when you’re traveling don’t have to worry  about this leaking in your bag. A little goes a long way! I use it with a facial brush or just with my hands and I get a clean smooth feeling face -no tightness, no greasy or filmy feeling. I love how my face feels after using it"
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,Nice!,"This is one of the few cleansers that I feel actually cleanses and clears my skin. I have fair, combination/acne prone skin and this doesn’t dry me out. It has also really improved the texture of my skin. Wouldn’t recommend for people with dry skin as I think it might dry them out, but for me with somewhat oilier skin, it really works."
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,Canada,amazing,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I just go have little bit of acne on my forehead, and when I bought this it cleared it up so quick. In under a month. It’s amazing for acne."
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Special Cleansing Gel,Great for sensitive skin like mine! This product is gentle and doesn’t strip your face.
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,skin always feels so soft after,This is has been my mom’s go to cleanser forever and I always steal it when I visit. Now I’ve bought my own. It’s so gentle and really just a high quality basic cleanser that for the quantity is worth the price tag at least at 16.9z
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,Canada,DERMALOGICA Special Cleansing Gel,The best cleanser for my combination skin. Tried switching to another cleanser because of the price but always come back to this product. I have repurchased this about 5 times now. Doesn't dry out your skin or irritate.
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,the best cleanser of all time,My favorite cleanser of all time. I’ve been using this since I was 10. I’ve tried other cleansers but they always made my skin feel stripped. This cleanser does not. Worth every penny.
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,Canada,love it!,One of the best cleansers I have used by far. I have dry skin but didnt find this product too drying or harsh. Has a slight citrus smell which I love. I bought the value size and have been loving it!
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,Canada,not worth the hype,"This product was not efficient at breaking down makeup. I would have to double, sometimes triple cleanse to really feel like my skin was cleaned."
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,BREAKOUT CENTRAL,"I wanted to love this so badly, but my skin just continued to break out on my jawline for weeks. I thought it was hormones until I stopped using it and my skin finally calmed down."
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,Canada,Best for sensitive skin,Best for sensitive face. I will only use face wash by Dermalogica
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,Canada,Makes my skin incredibly dry,I’ve used this daily for a year - one bottle lasts a long time! But over that year my skin got VERY dry and flaky. I also bought their exfoliating scrub and it smells gross and too small to do any real exfoliating. After cleansing and exfoliating and moisturizing my skin would still shed and appear very dry. I went for a recent facial and was told to stop using whichever brand of cleanser and exfoliate I was using because my skin was much more hydrated at my previous facial. Would not buy again and cannot recommend.
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,great cleanser,This makes my skin feel SO clean after use. My natural oils are still present but my skin is soft and supple after I wash with this gel!
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,Canada,DERMALOGICA Special Cleansing Gel,have been using this for only 3 days now and has already gotten rid of my comedonal acne
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Special Cleansing Gel,Good but leaves my face extremely dry. Wouldn’t buy again.
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,Canada,AMAZING,This is such an amazing product. You only need the littlest bit and it goes such a long way. Definitely my favourite cleaner ever.
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,Love the Dermalogica Cleansing Gel !,Such a nice and gentle facial cleanser that I like to use daily . I have a sensitive skin and I feel like this product is doing the job and makes my skin feel soft and clean . I would definitely recommend it .
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,Canada,DERMALOGICA Special Cleansing Gel,Dermalogica has saved my skin. This is one of the only cleansers that have worked well with my skin
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,Canada,"It works, but nothing crazy special","For background, my skin: fair, combination/oily, several patches of rosacea, occasional acne

I used to use cheap, drugstore Purpose Gentle Face Wash all the time, but can no longer find it widely, so have been searching for a basic, everyday replacement. I'm not at all a fan of Cerave (never felt like it cleaned well, smells weird) and I've tried a few other drugstore brands without the love. 

I tried this and several other ""basic"" face washes (YTTP Superfood Cleanser, Origins Frothy Face Wash, FAB Pure Skin Facial Cleanser) all at once to try and find the best one for me and this one was honestly probably my least favorite. It cleanses just okay - it doesn't quite remove the light amount of makeup I wear, but does get rid of any morning oiliness without stripping. I know ""foaming"" can be just a psychological effect without providing any extra cleansing benefit, but I do wish it would foam/spread a bit more - it tends to stay as a gel consistency throughout cleansing. Overall, I will certainly use it, but for the price, I feel like there are much better values out there."
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Special Cleansing Gel,"Such a nice and gentle facial cleanser that I like to use daily. So far love how it's easy to use and not overly stripping of my face oils especially when my skin is drier in the winter, although it's still important to use moisturizer after. I do get some light acne on occasion and haven't seen any difference on that end but will continue to use daily. So far it does the job! Product complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for honest review."
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Special Cleansing Gel,I've been using this daily for over ten years- keeps my sensitive skin clean without turning me beet red.
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,mediocre face-wash with bad packaging,I ordered this product about a week ago and finally got it today. I have tried Dermalogica in the past and it works fine for me. It's nothing mind-blowing but when I got my package and the tamper seal was broken. I didn't feel comfortable using an open cleanser so I just had to accept the loss. Overall it's a decent cleanser in my opinion.
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Special Cleansing Gel,"This Daily Microfoliant is very good because I can use it every day, and for someone with sensitive skin this is great because it does not cause any irritation when rubbed on my face, it leaves my skin soft and without impurities.  now I want to know more about this brand and its products.  Complimentary from Dermalogica"
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,"face cleansing gel washes the face well, the smell",".face cleansing gel washes the face well, the smell is ok. does not leave a dry, unpleasant to the touch face. the packaging is quite large. I have nothing to fault with this product. performs all its functions. Gifted by dermalogica"
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,Trusted Cleanser,This product was gifted to me by Dermalogica. Really like this cleanser! My face definitely feels very clean after using it and it comes from such a trusted brand like Dermalogica. I would recommend this as your first cleanser and then using a hydrating one afterwards.
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,Been eyeing for years,"Ive been eyeing Dermalogica for years now, only heard good things about it. This was one of the first companies on the market for skin cleansing. This was gifted by Dermalogica. Ive been using this with the PreCleanse (oil) and been feeing great bearskin! It does leave my skin dry but moisturizer fixes everything! 
Great product, worst the every penny!"
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,Skincare favorite!!! :),"Absolutely love this cleanser I was gifted by Dermalogica! It is such a gentle cleanser on my skin that equally offers it a deep clean. After every cleanse, it leaves my skin feeling hydrated, balanced, and soft. I have also noticed some older acne scars fading away once I introduced this into my skincare routine. Overall, I am loving this cleanser as a part of my daily skincare routine."
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,Formula Change,I am so sad to give this review because I used this wash for a couple years. Recently they changed the formula and now it smells funny and makes me break out HORRIBLY. Wish they could go back
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,Love this cleanser!,"I really enjoyed this cleanser alot, that I received complimentary from Dermologica. It says it's a ""gel"" cleanser but to me it's more of a cream cleanser, which lathers up really well. I love how gentle it is, so it would be perfect for any skin type and to use daily. It is super hydrating and my skin feels super refreshed after!"
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,Clean and moisturize ♥️,"This was Gifted by  dermalogica in exchange of my honest review. 
I love the opportunity to test and use demalogica cleanser gel not only because if works as intended but also moisturize your skin it’s not like that squeaky clean skin feeling some others leave, this cleanser leaves your skin smooth and neat after."
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,DERMALOGICA Special Cleansing Gel,I loved this cleanser so much! It was so gentle yet still a deep clean. It gets pretty foamy so a little bit goes a long way. I only used a dime sized amount and it covered my whole face and even neck. The scent is light and fresh not super fragrant like other cleansers tend to be. It’s the perfect daily cleanser I highly recommend!
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,So gentle and keeps my skin balanced,"I love this cleanser I was gifted by Dermalogica! The gel like texture makes a good light lather that doesn't feel like too much. It feels gentle on my combination skin and it leaves it feeling balanced and smooth, not dry at all. I had a few breakouts and I feel like this helped clear them out instead of irritating them further.  I also love that this formula works great with my cleansing device too. I actually use this on my body too, back of the shoulders where I was getting some body acne and it worked wonderful for that as well. Right now I have no breakouts, my skin has stayed clean and clear."
DERMALOGICA-Special Cleansing Gel,USA,get it!,This is the first product I’ve tried from dermalogica and I am literally obsessed! This cleansing gel makes my face feel really clean without making me feel like I have striped all of the oils from my skin. I’m definitely repurchasing this again
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,New Zealand,love love love,"so good, I have combination skin and it’s healed my dry patches without making me oily!! good price for what you get too. surprisingly smells good for a fragrance free product, most smell awful. will definitely buy again. "
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,Soft skin,"The inkey list is such a great brand especially the hyaluronic acid cleanser is my favourite,every time I use it it makes my skin so soft and Glowy
,I will be purchasing more in the future 😁"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,so good,cleared my skin up so good! had bad acne for a while and tried everything but nothing cleared up my skin as much as this product! such a staple in my skincare now
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Malaysia,a gem to be discovered,"I didn’t expect that i would actually like this product cause im so used to tatcha, estee lauder and it cosmetics vibe cleanser and woah it did a 360 on me! My skin is not only softer but my pimples seems to be alot less than im used to (hormones up and down) and the price is wayyyy cheaper too!"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,Great for sensitive skin,"My previous cleanser started to break me out and I wanted to try a wallet-friendly replacement. My skin is usually dry and really sensitive but has responded amazingly to this cleanser! My only issue is that it does not remove eye makeup whatsoever, so now I’m adding another step to my routine to remove mascara at the end of the day. But aside from that, my skin looks amazing and is super hydrated without getting oily!"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,2 in 1 product,"Very different from other cleansers I have used. Doesn’t leave skin dry and takes off traces of make-up. Good affordable cleanser. A bottle lasts a long time as you just need just a dime size product. Overall very good cleanser, will be repurchasing it until they stop making it ;)"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Malaysia,great,Its hydrating to the skin and not drying after wash. The Smell is not my favourite but I like the texture of my skin after washing. Its supple and smooth.
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,Jodie,"Another good product from the Inkey List. Cleanses my skin, doesn’t strip it or sensitise it. Gets the job done without fancy bells and whistles. If you want to remove makeup I’d suggest using their oat cleanser balm first which I love before cleansing with this."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,Hydrating cleanser,This hyaluronic acid cleanser is great for those looking for a non-stripping clean! I use this cleanser after removing my makeup to clean away all of the residue. Moisturisers and serums should still be used afterwards! I definitely recommend this daily gentle cleanser. 
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Singapore,love it,I love this cleanser. It didn’t break me out and i have sensitive and acne prone skin. Face feels clean after every wash. Affordable too!! Would definitely purchase again 
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,it's a mehh cleanser,"I bought this cleanser just to try, its very affordable and I enjoy the serums from this brand. Unfortunately I did not enjoy this cleanser, even though it has no added scent the smell that has naturally occurred is very off putting for me, I also felt that it left a layer of some sort on my skin and my skin didn't feel or look cleansed after works."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,New Zealand,best for dry skin,After devolving dry skin after iostretionoin my skin was always lacking moisture this product helped to heal my skin barrier. Would highly recommend to anyone how is looking for a hydrating cleanser
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Malaysia,Not suitable for oily sensitive skin ,Not suitable for my oily sensitive skin. It’s make me breakout more. Just buy the Simple brand face wash it’s more worth it. Don’t waste money for this face wash
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,New Zealand,Good cleanser ,I’ve seen an improvement in my skin and after i wash my face it feels nice and smooth. the bottle is also nice looking for on my vanity xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Malaysia,Hydrating ,A very hydrating gel cleanser for my oily skin. A small amount is adequate enough to clean the whole face. Highly recommended for those who wish to have non-foaming gel cleanser! 
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Malaysia,just okay,Something that you dont really need because you will wash off the benefit. But give it a try if you have dry skin. But i prefer using my usual cleanser.
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,Very Drying ,Not a fan. I have oily dehydrated skin so I thought this might help with that. After use my skin felt stripped and dry. I wouldn’t even recommend this for oily skin either as you don’t want to completely strip your skin of all moisture or it will produce more oil to compensate. This felt like putting washing up detergent on my face. What a shame. Stick to something else. 
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,Huge pass,I wanted to love it but is not as hydrating as La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Face Wash or the Ordinary squalene cleanser. Honestly is huge pass. Will not purchase again.
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,New Zealand,Simple cleanser ,This is a great cleanser when you want something gentle yet effective. I use this every morning and gives a great base to start the rest of your skincare. Don’t feel stripped but also has a nice consistency 
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,love it ,"Perfect addition to your skin care regime. This is a lovely product. Not overpowering in smell, but effective. I would recommend this product for the price point. Love xx "
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,"It don’t make foam but it cleans the face very well, leave a moisture on the face."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Singapore,The best,"I’ve been dealing with Sensitive oily acne prone skin. It’s hard to find the right skincare. So far, this cleanser has done it’s work! Been using it for 3 weeks and i love it! Will definitely continue using this"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,New Zealand,AMAZING,"LOVE LOVE LOVE. GET THIS PRODUCT! It is so nice and refreshing. My skin feels clean, hydrated and plump! Such great value for money! I would recommend buying when in-stock because this cleanser is so popular it can be hard to get your hands on! "
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,just okay,"For the price i guess you could expect limited impact. While this is a very affordable choice, doesnt make my skin feel very clean even when double cleansing combined with oil cleanser prior to using this one"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Malaysia,face cleanser ,This is my first time trying this cleanser out my go to was the oat cleansing balm and this product amazed me as well it leaves your face looking healthy and hydrated since it has hyaluronic acid in it !
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,Instant Glow,"Immediately achieved glowing (dewy, not greasy) skin after first use; however, did result in a month-long purging period before skin became clearer in conjunction with other exfoliating products and treatment serums.

Pleasantly light and thorough but not stripping, an excellent morning cleanser or single step in a double cleanse."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,Heavy and sticky but amazing,"First time I’ve used this product and i found it heavy when i put it on but after i washed it off, it was like magic on my skin! i had dry flakey skin all winter and this product made it soft and i love it! will definitely recommend to people i know that are just starting to do skincare!"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,New Zealand,amazing ,"So good at removing makeup!! Fav product I’ve ever used. Feels super hydrating. Wont ever go back. Really seems to help dry skin while also doing a really good job at clearing off makeup and dirt 


"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Malaysia,hydrating,loooooveeeee should hrab this one and love ittttt very hydarting and yeahhhh must try and hope it suitable for guys tooooo and purchase during saleee so worth it
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,Cleanses well without tight skin feeling,"I have combination acne-prone skin, wear makeup often, and this cleanser cleanses my skin so well. No breakouts, no tight feeling, just fresh clean hydrated skin. This cleanser has a lightweight gel cream formula that feels nice on the skin. Cons: kinda smells waxy and doesn’t lather but that doesn’t bother me too much."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,"This cleanser is so smooth, a must have. It definitely improved my skin"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,Great,Great product. I use as a second cleanse and leaves skin feeling clean but not dry or tight. 
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,"it’s a pretty mediocre cleanser however super hydrating, affordable and never leaves my skin tight! it’s a nice lightweight texture that works best all year long for that extra boost of hydration and dew."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,Didn’t seem to do anything for me,"This cleanser was okay but I feel like it didn’t clean my skin very well. I never really saw a change in my acne when I used it. It didn’t dry out my skin though, so that’s a plus. It’s also affordable. It wasn’t terrible but personally I don’t think I would buy again."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,Really good!,"I mixed this cleanser with my usual face wash and it really helped my skin to glow after only a couple weeks of using it. Would definitely recommend! 
"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,I am really enjoying this product at the moment. I haven’t seen too much improvement in hydrating my skin however I do like the texture and how it feels. It seems to do a good job cleansing and too not drying. Overall I would recommend.
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,"Unscented, gentle and removes makeup!","Unscented, gentle and removes makeup—a win-win for my sensitive skin. This is one of the few products that I can use that I am not allergic to and does a good job cleansing and removes makeup. This will be a staple in my routine."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,It's a pass for me,"This cleanser is just ""okay"" at best. I much prefer the salicylic acid cleanser from Inkey list, I couldn't stand the smell of this cleanser, it smelt like wax/crayons and is very oily feeling and my skin did not feel ""clean"" after using it. I wouldn't purchase again."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,Better than I expected,"My skin is sensitive, prone to acne and oily. This product is amazing! It's great for the price. Your skin gets cleaned and it doesn't make it dry. I have purchased this two times and I will keep purchasing it."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,New Zealand,Mrs ,Just love this product..works well..follow instructions and you will get the results..wish I had discovered these products when I was younger but at least they do there job even at a late start in life..hydrates my face and after a week of using them I can already feel and see the difference..will highly recommend it..top of my list
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,I love this cleanser,I love this cleanser..very hydrating.. I’m using  this cleanser with oat cleanser from inkey list. Great for double cleansing of shaving your face. Or just in cold days when your skin needs extra hydration 
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Love this cleanser feels so amazing and does the job so good
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Malaysia,ms,"Tried today for first time and I love it! I use this after remove my makeup with oil makeup remover but I can see alot of mascara came out during cleansing, surprisingly. Recommending to all especially with this price tag. 
"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,love it,Love it! The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it claims to be “intensely hydrating” which is fairly exaggerated. Overall it is hydrating and does the job well but still strips enough that I’m personally uncomfortable if I don’t follow with a moisturizer.
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Would buy again. Kinda reminds me of Vanicream? Re the texture and scent (unscented scent) and gentleness.
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,New Zealand,quite impressed ,"My skin is normal to dry and I'm late 40s.  This is a really nice cleanser.  You only need a small amount, it cleans really well and it doesn't make my skin feel a bit tight after. A great  cleanser for a great price!"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,"didn't really love this cleanser, although i do find it to be more effective than the salicylic acid one. the contents also last for a surprisingly long time. deducting points for the HORRIBLE PACKAGING and the CAP THAT BREAKS AFTER A COUPLE DAYS. i've been through a few bottles of the inkey list's cleansers already and every single bottle's cap has broken off. without fail."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,Nice,This has been really nice. It doesn’t bother my sensitive skin at all. It works well. It’s a good price. Worth it.
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,New Zealand,Great Buy,Slightly more viscous than imagined it to be but it’s a good thing though. This did not break me out! Amazing! Swapping my chemist brand face wash for this.
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,So good for the price!!,"For being so affordable, it exceeded my expectations! My skin had cleared up after using this product for only a couple of weeks, and I saw a difference in a matter of days. 
My skin is also quite dry around my forehead, nose, chin and cheeks, and this did not irritate or make it any worse. 
Along with another moisturiser, my skin has never been better."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,Love it,GREAT cleanser i have nothing bad to say i use it as my second cleanser when i double cleanse
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,Best (accidental) purchase ever!!,"So I normally use the Salicylic Cleanser by Inkey, however in a rush I accidentally grabbed this one at the store and didn’t bother looking at the container before I poured it in my hands. Me being lazy I decided to try it out and see how it works for my very hormonal skin. Safe to say this is now my go to cleanser. It’s hydrating, feels like a gel, and leaves my face feeling like a fresh canvas. As someone who struggles a lot with acne finding a basic cleanser is a challenge and I really lucked out with my oopsie! I now rotate this with my salicystic cleanser depending how my face feels and have had great results."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,the inkey list,definetly love this brand and cleanser so smooth on my skin and cleans so well will definitely be buying again in the future for sure!!! Love love love it 
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,cleanser,I absolutely love using this cleanser. I usually use Cerave but decided on a change and I was pleasantly surprised. It doesn’t lather excessively and that’s okay with me. It’s great at removing makeup and leaves skin looking nice and plump. 
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Works okay in the morning but doesn’t sufficiently wash off the oil cleanser in a double cleanse.
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,Basic cleanser,"This is a simple, gentle cleanser that does the job. I don't find it too stripping. Great value for the price. Unsure whether I'd repurchase as it's nothing groundbreakingly amazing. "
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,3/10,"Gentle moisturiser, removes make-up well. It does leave my skin feeling tight and dry which is surprising since it has hyaluronic acid."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Singapore,combi skin,Great cleanser for combi skin 
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,Great product!,"Love this cleanser. It doesn't dry my skin out, but also works well only 'a bit oily' t-zone! 
It's overall a very gentle cleanser, doesn't dry, and leaves your skin prepped for your skin care routine!"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,honestly this clears my skin up so fast and I feel like it also makes my face super soft :)
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,Amazing cleanser!,"Great cleanser. Super gentle, but cleans great! Takes off all the make-up and leaves skin very very clean!"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,good product ,For the price it’s one of the best in the market at the moment. Made my skin bright and sold and definitely will buy it again. Might be irritating to sensitive skin would suggest a patch test first  
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,A must have!,"I only write reviews after I've used a product for awhile.  And the INKEY Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser? A must have!  I've been using it for about a year and for my skin it's perfect. I follow up with the Retinol a few times a week and the moisturizer (another product I have to review - awesome).  My skin has been consistently calm, looking refreshed, and compliments abound!  LOVE!"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Malaysia,Good,This is a new product from The Ordinary. Just thought of giving it a try. I have been using their Fulvic Acid Cleanser and let me tell you- that is 1 hellofa cleanser. 
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,So-so,"I got this because the salicylic acid cleanser would dry my skin out after using to where I’d have to immediate put hyaluronic acid on, so I figured this would be a decent alternative and wouldn’t dry my face out. It wasn’t drying, but I feel it didn’t also do much of anything. It doesn’t lather well, and I didn’t feel or see much of any difference. It’s just not for me, but I’ll sure others would find it great."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,I really recommend this product for people with sensitive and dry skin as it doesn’t irritate my eczema prone skin at all and is very moisturizing. My face dries up really quickly so this cleanser has really helped with it not flaking up overnight while still being effective in getting rid of all the buildup on my face throughout the day.
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Five star product my skin feels fresh and plumbing
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,Gentle hydrating cleanser,I really liked this cleanser because it was gentle yet able to remove my sunscreen and makeup.  I like to alternate between this cleanser and their SA cleanser
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,Lovely for dry skin,"I have combination skin and this product worked for me it is a gel formula with no sud’s and is quite gentle on the skin, a perfect morning cleanser perhaps in the night a more deep cleanser would be sufficient. Overall recommend this product is wonderful for the skin and great price always a win with inkey list."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,Horrible! made me break out,"broke out sooo bad, I cant get rid of my acne now bc of this! Do not buy!!!!"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Malaysia,Lovely Cleanser,I used this cleanser as my first cleanser and second cleanser. Great to pair with oat cleansing balm and polyglutamic acid but not a great routine if combined with hyaluronic acid serum. Can use with niacinamide serum. 
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Was a fan of the salicylic acid cleanser so I wanted to try this one and I love it. My skin has never been softer or more hydrated. I never get compliments about my skin but someone told me recently I have a great complexion and I think its partly because of this product. Does an alright job of removing makeup so I make sure to use a makeup remover before using this product.
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,"Wow, I immediately broke out in a bunch of small bumps all over my face! It might work for some people but it definitely didn’t work for me. Hoping I can return this and try something else."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,100% Satisfactory,"I liked this cleanser enough to purchase again. It doesn't leave my skin overly dry and removes my makeup well. It's perfect for my combo, sometimes oily skin. I wouldn't recommend it for drier skins. I really like the container because it allows me to get every last drop of product out without wasting it. It doesn't have much of a scent which is good but also doesn't smell so amazing that it makes me look forward to washing my face with it. It foams nicely. The price point is amazing for the size. I would definitely recommend trying it."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,broke me out,Broke me out bad!! Do not use this! I’ve always had clear skin but once I tried this out everything went wrong!
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,not for very dry skin,"I want to love this cleanser. I have very dry skin and hyaluronic acid cleansers always leave my skin feeling soft and moisturized, but not this one."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Malaysia,"yes, yes , yes",This is one of my fav cleanser. It doesn't leave my face feeling tight and irritated and leaves my skin hydrated and soft. It doesn't do a good job at taking make off tho.
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,This made my skin so itchy! I’ve tried a lot of this brands products and my skin just isn’t a fan.
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,not what I ordered,Ordered the Hylauronic acid cleaner and received the chia seed curling hair cream? Not what I ordered? How do I go about exchanging? …………………. . ? ? ? ? ?
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,It is a gentle cleanser will take off foundation but not eye makeup. Skin feels not overly hydrated but not stripped either. Would recommend as part of a double cleanse routine
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,How good is this!,Amazing Suff!  This is just the best and is such good value for money.  Takes a full face of make up off no problems. I will definitely be buying this again!
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,perfect for my oily skin ,I really like this cleanser. I use this as my second cleanse and it really gets the rest of what my first cleanse missed. My skin feels clean and I do not get any tightness afterwards. I will definitely be repurchasing. 
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,The best!!!,The cleanser feels good on the skin. so refreshing!!! and it's affordable too.
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,Cleared my acne and hyperpigmentation,literally so good you can feel it unclog your pores when you massage it into your skin. it doesn't leave your face feeling stiff or tight and you can see actually results. removes makeup excellently even the bad gal bag mascara comes off on the first cleanse with this cleanser. 10/10 my fav
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,Amazing,I LOVE this cleanser!!!! I have super dry skin when I wake up and this is so hydrating but not like other hydrating cleansers that feel like ur using lotion to clean. the price feels like robbery its so cheap for how great this product is. A true staple in my routine.
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,I love it!!,"It makes my skin feel hydrated and clean, i use it in the mornings before the rest of my products and at night after the oat cleansing balm, i do dislike the smell as it reminds me of dish soap but i love it otherwise!"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,simple and effective,"I have very dry skin in the winter and this cleanser is the only one I've tried that doesn't strip my skin in minus 30 climates. It doesn't really lather, it only slightly foams so I didn't get that squeaky clean overly stripped feeling. It's not a ""fancy"" cleanser but it does it's job well. My skin does in fact feel clean after using it, and I'm planning on buying a second bottle.

I do usually use a micellar water for my eye makeup as cleansers usually aren't thorough enough to remove my mascara, eyeliner etc."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,"Good if you have really dry skin, otherwise I wouldn’t recommend this product to people with oily skin. Also, the face wash doesn’t have suds and it doesn’t feel like you’re face is being washed for how non-soap like it is."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Australia,Loving it,"This cleanser is so mild, and refreshing. It doesn’t break me out, and love the price too. It is the cheapest one I own, as I normally go for more expensive ones, but it is one of my favourite "
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,It broke me out pretty bad. Not recommending for sensitive skin or combination skin at all.

THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,Great cleanser when your face is going through it,Very good cleanser when you are really having a hard time getting your skin to recover from acne. Will help clear skin in days of a breakout or blemish. Love The Inkey list brand. Love the price too affordable and works better than the expensive stuff. Way to go!
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Great product that I got to try for free for a honest review about the product and I have to start by saying that my skin looks fabulous and well hydrated
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,This cleanser worked really well on my skin. It was very gentle for my sensitive skin which I loved!!! I also noticed a difference in my redness on my chin after using
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,"Very good, but not my favorite! I noticed it did help with my hormonal acne and I loved that it didn’t overly dry out my skin. But it did take a while of using to experience the full affects. I would still recommend!"
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,"It doesn’t lather as much as I like, won’t do a great job of removing make up. But fine as a second step cleanser."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,Didn't really work for me.,I've been using the Inkey List hyaluronic acid cleanser on my body as I suffer from some chest and back acne. I don't feel like this dries out my skin like some other cleansers but I also have not been super impressed with the effect it's had on my acne. Maybe for others it will?
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,USA,So much relief from Inkey hyaluronics!,"I have a dry chapped face. This cleanser doesn't sting, burn, or leave me dry and tight. I follow with Inkey hyaluronic serum while skin is still damp and air dry. I use Inkey collagen and Brighten-i and finish with Inkey Omega Water. No more painful, chapped face and flakey makeup."
THE INKEY LIST-Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser,Canada,Doesn't Feel Clean,"I was looking for a moisturizing cleanser for the winter so I tried this. I don't usually have issues with my pores, but I noticed that after using this for a while, my pores became more visible due to being clogged up. I had to use my clay mask a few times and a better cleanser, and my pores were back to normal."
THIS WORKS-Evening Detox Cleansing Water,Singapore,detox cleansing water,Super duper great product.  I tried it on the shop and was absolutely sold. It has a watery texture. it cleans up like a breeze and does not leave any sticky residue. My face feels so clean. It has a soothing scent too.

DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Water + Refill,Malaysia,this is a need ,Dermaclear Micro Water  from Dr Jart will be always my number 1 for double cleansing. It makes my skin feel so clean and also fresh!!! 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Water + Refill,Singapore,"Not great, just average","This is a bit of an underwhelming product. The formula is pleasant and quite light but as a makeup remover, it's not great. It often leaves a lot of residual makeup behind. "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Water + Refill,Malaysia,Dermaclear Micro Water,"This product is really good. It is more than just a cleansing makeup remover(and it does that very well!). This stuff is a treatment with some really good ingredients such as Royal jelly, Pearl Powder and Ferment Filtrate (Sake), which is similar to SKII at a fraction of the cost."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Water + Refill,Singapore,Okay ,"Acts just like any other micellar water product, I mean it’s just a cleansing water, I can’t expect it to do wonders to my skin. I use it like a lip and eye remover cause I absolutely hate oil based remover on my eyes or lips. So this does the work for me. Sometimes when I’m too tired to do double cleansing I’ll just go in with this for my whole face. It’s not the best way to remove makeup since double cleanse is mandatory in order to remove every residue of makeup. This works once in a while as a full cleanse, I don’t get break out the next day even though I only did one cleanse with this. "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Water + Refill,Singapore,sensitive skin & Dry Skin please read!!,"I love this product at the starting. Only starting. This product definitely can be counted one of the best cleanser I ever use even compare to eve lom. This product can remove waterproof mascara etc at 0 pressures. However, i don’t know what happened when I use the product turn till 2nd month, the products went wrong. I get sensitive, red small dots, full on my face. I even experiment using my half face to try whether is the product issue. And result is yes. I bought 3 set of this cleanser, every set went to same result. I’m not sure whether the product easily went spoiled. But it definitely can’t be use if explode to air for a long time."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Water + Refill,Malaysia,"nice product , Poor online shopping experience ","Finally got my order after 1 month++, is really long wait till I finish all my cleansing product at home .... I love the product but very disappointed with Sephora online shopping experience. I don’t think I will dare to online order any product from Sephora again! "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Water + Refill,Malaysia,My Holygrail ,"I have purchased it 4 times already. One of the best micellar water I ever had. I don’t really like oil cleanser to remove makeup, but this one works like wonder. It took only 2 cotton pads to clean the overall makeup on my face. It does not sting my skin at all. I love very much!!!"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Water + Refill,,meh,on the packaging it says could be used alone but it feels a little sticky/ uncomfortable on the skin. skin is not sensitive yet when i use this my face would sting. panning it due to the price but would definitely not repurchase.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Water + Refill,,Wished it works better,"I wanted to love this so badly because my skin is tired of the Bioderma series (there seems to be nothing else that truly works for my skin). However, this was disappointing and left my eyes stinging even if it hadnt been in contact with the product. It works; but just barely compared to the one swipes im used to. Would pass. "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Water + Refill,,love it,"this micro water has a citrusy scent and i really like it. it does a great job at taking off my makeup too and it doesn't sting my eyes, which is great!"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Water + Refill,,good,Like water don’t have chemical smell better than other make up removal not oily no chemical smell and worth of price will consider buy it again I think
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Water + Refill,,causes redness,"My skin is not super sensitive usually yet this makes it red and itchy. Wouldn’t recommend for someone with skin sensitivities. Smells nice, non greasy."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Water + Refill,,Not bad,It works well. Remove my makeup effectively and does not break out my skin. It has a pleasant scent too. Super worthy as I purchased during sales.     
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Water + Refill,,this is good and not drying,this is a great makeup remover. not drying and doesnt sting my eye. i even use this to remove my waterproof mascara. i make sure to place the saturated cottonpad on my closed eyelids and lashes. leave for a few seconds and then only gently swipe. does a great job. am glad to get a chance to purchase this at such a great price
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,I bought wrongly 🤭,Actually I  want to buy this ckeanser in pH level but I couldn't see when I was buying it's quite dry my face it's not good for my skin jst average it is

DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,abit drying,I love it as it cleanse really well. But it feels dry after washing. Will not repurchase as I have found other clean yet not drying cleansers. Not bad for oily skin I feel.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,a good beginner’s cleanser,perfect for all skin types — does not dry out your skin and builds up nice and foamy as well. very creamy and non-scented. gets the dirt and oil out without the tightening sensation. 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Australia,Mr,"Good cleanser, foams up nicely and not drying."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,Micro Foam,It really Micro Foam like what was stated. A tiny bit using the bubble net can create like whipped cream. Really fine bubbles the can cleanse ur skin so well without over drying. Great Dr Jart
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,light cleanser,"Very light cleanser but somehow can cause dryness. Doesnt leave skin squeaky clean , and when i cleanse with a toner, there are still significant residue. "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Canada,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,A favorite of mine. I already went through several packages.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Canada,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Really great cleanser for my combination to dry skin type!
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,good,Foamy cleanser . It’s not drying as well which is good ….. glad to hv purchased this….. hope to try other products ….. from dr Jart …..😊😊😊😊 the sheet mask has been my fav 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,Ms,"When use morning & night, face keep matt for whole day. Oil control, face squeaky clean & plump up after cleansing. Size last for few months use. Price is affordable. Thoroughly cleans dirt & oil. Results visible. This Korean trustee brand is worth the try. There are many oil control cleansers brands, I did a check on reviews, seems this brand produces results. Will continue to use product. "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,Cleans well but stings eyes,"Gives skin a clean feeling, I use this in the evening to rid of oiliness. Bad thing about this is how it stings the eyes a lot, so I have to wash it off almost right after slathering on and foaming. "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,amazing ,"this is sooo good, it is so hydrating and cleans the skin very well"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,so-so,"Got this for the husband, tried using it myself.. It was so-so as it kinda have the drying effect and skin felt tight after each wash. Dont think i’ll repurchase this."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Canada,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,I got this cleaner after a friend recommend it. I used every night when I shower I washed my face and it just feels so clean and nice after. I would completely recommend to try it!
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,Gentle Cleanser,Gentle on the skin and helps to prevent breakouts. Smell is mild but pleasant.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,Repeat Purchase ,Been buying this for a while now for my sister and she loves it. She does have a bit of a sensitive skin too. It lasts for a really long time as well so definitely worth every penny. 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,amazing!,"I have been on and off using cleanser since I thought my skin is fairly okay, and am afraid if I use something it will damage my skin. Dr Jart cleanser is just the perfect product! Love the after effect, the price and size are great too! Recommending this to anyone who wants to start on something :)"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,Effective cleanser for men,"My husband use it, not me. He really likes it and he's on his 3rd bottle. It did not cause any breakout. His skin type is combination to oily, but it doesn't make his skin totally oil free throughout the day. That said, there is no single product to improve oily skin and different factors play a role in minimizing it. Overall great product."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,a little too drying ,"This product cleanses okay. If you do not use makeup, you may use this for double cleansing.  But if you have thick makeup on, it would be better to use cleansing balm or oil first and then this for the second cleansing. After use, my skin feels clean but wiping the water, skin starts to feel so tight like it’s gonna crack(I’ve got combi skin). The pH version for this product would be better for combi skin. More moisturizing."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Canada,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,"I like Dr. Jart+ Dermaclear™ Micro Foam.
My daughter and my son also like it."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,foam cleanser,"Foamy cleanser , not harsh to skin. Keeps the skin cleaned and no complain about it.

DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,all time fav!,"This is the best facial cleanser i’ve ever have! It feels so clean after wash. The scents are very soft and floral,it suitable for sensative skin as well. After wash my face it wont feels irritating or dry. This already is my 4th bottles."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,does not remove makeup.,Really did not love this product. I use a lot of dr jart products and this one is prob the worst. Does not cleanse well and def don’t remove ANY makeup. I can wash my face 5 times with this and use a cotton pad and still have makeup on my skin. Do not recommend.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Canada,Worth the price!,A little goes a long way and lasts long. If your thinking of a facial wash try this one or the Cicapair facial wash. One of my holy grail! Great for sensitive/combination skin.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Canada,Love it,Love this. A little goes a long way! A small dot lathers up like crazy. Face fees so clean. Definitely recommend.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,"It smells terrible smells like hand soap. And broke me out everywhere looks like i’m a Teen going thru
 puberty"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Worst Dr. Jart product I've used,Dr. Jart brand of skincare products is a favorite of mine. This cleanser felt terrible on my skin - it feels like it's stripping away moisture. The only cleansers for my face worse than this are bar soap and the facial cleanser from Saturday.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,average,Just an average product. Nothing much to do on my skin. However The smell is nice. Also having no problem with the texture and finishing of the product
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,love this!!,Only face cleanser that works for both me and my husband. He has very oily skin and I have combination skin die also gets very dry. We are both very active and acne-prone. It’s really worth it only a tiny bit goes a long way. It stings a little if you leave it on for too long but honestly nothing works better than this in my opinion
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,excellent daily facewash,"Such a nice creamy formula, just need a little and it foams up perfectly, doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin and leaves my face feeling super clean, but not dried out."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Philippines,feels good! ,I love how this feels on my skin! Creamy and easy on the skin. I have sensitive skin and I didn’t break out from this. I use it mostly in the morning. Very gentle and doesn’t have a strong scent. Highly recommended! 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,nice one,Already use it for around 2 months. One of the best face wash that i have been using. My skin felt very clean n fresh every time i am using it. Very nice and will repurchase!!!
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,Not bad!,One of my favourite cleanser. The foam cleanser cleans well without leaving the stripping feeling on dry skin. Scent is okay. One tube lasts for months.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,not too bad,i used it for a bit and changed to another cleanser. this cleanser was fine but nothing too extraordinary. it wasn't too harsh on my skin and did do the job.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,all time favourite,"my all time favourite cleanser for the past year. it does not leave my skin dry after cleaning my face at all. yes, doesnt strip off the moisture from my skin, but at the same time, it makes your face 100% squeaky clean!"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Canada,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Really good for combination skin. Feels great in the skin and doesn't have a strong smell.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Philippines,Okay Cleanser,"It’s a cleanser, it does it’s job. I was afraid that since there were ingredients like Myristic Acid that it might break me out, although fortunately it didn’t. Although, for what it is, I’m pretty sure you can get something similar elsewhere."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Canada,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,"This is the BEST cleanser ever. I was suffering from breakouts due to trying other tea tree line and this cleanser removed them!! It foams beautifully, totally recommend it"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Canada,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Good for oily skin in summer but wouldn’t recommend it for use during the colder seasons as it can be too drying for skin.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,does the job,Clean every make up and leave the skin really soft. You need literally a small smallest quantity with some water you will have a lot of foam!!
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Canada,Cleared Up Stubborn Breakout!,"I had been trying to clear up a breakout for over a month with my previous cleanser. This cleared it up in just over a week of use! My skin has never looked better. I have Very sensitive skin and I haven’t reacted to this in any way. It does have a very soapy smell, kind of like those decorative soap balls grandmas always have on the back of their toilet. And you have to clean out the lid after almost every use, otherwise it doesn’t close all the way. But that doesn’t really bother me because it’s done wonders for my skin. And a little goes a Long way."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,foamy,"When I m using this type of cleanser, it will make my skin feel fresh after I washed using it. Very foamy. Not too dry for my skin and easy to apply. Would recommend to others"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Yay Dermaclear,This cleanser is all-around lovely. It foams up and leaves a satisfying clean for my sensitive skin. A bottle lasts ages!
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,love this cleanser,I love this product! It only needs a tiny bit but does wonders for thoroughly cleansing your face :) would purchase again!
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Perf for Sensitive Skin!,"This is my second bottle. I usually have two cleansers that I alternate between, depending on my skin's needs. This is the one for when my skin is feeling super sensitive [such as this week from retinol use]. I use an oil cleanser first and outside the shower. In the shower, I rinse off the oil cleanser, then I use this. I find that a little goes a long way. If I'm wearing sunscreen that day, I will run it over my arms to make sure all the sunscreen is off. Definitely give it a try, especially if you're sensitive to scented products."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,"This is the best cleanser I’ve ever used, and I have tried many. It is light, foams up perfectly, and rinses away quickly and easily. My toner pad comes away clean. I do use micellar water to remove makeup first. Normal to dry skin."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,"It smells heavenly, and a little bit of a product is enough to get sufficient foam to clean the face. I love it..."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,great for sensitive skin,"Best cleanser I’ve used. 
I have sensitive skin, and this is such a gentle but good cleanser. I can literally feel my skin clean."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Canada,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,my favorite cleanser by far!  skin feels nice a clean without over drying the skin
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,"I like this product a lot. I’ve been through a few different cleansers and this is good for a super clean feeling but still not feeling dried out/stripped. You only need such a tiny amount to get a good lather/foam going, a little goes a very long way. And the minimalist packaging sparks joy for me"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,"I have been through several bottles of this product. My skin feels so refreshed and clean after using it, but it doesn’t feel too stripped of moisture. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, and this had been my ride-or-die cleanser for a while."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Feels good; didn't clean 100%,I like the smell of this and it has a really interesting slippery gel-like texture. I just don't think it really cleans that well. I use my SK-II toner afterwards and the pad will have noticeable dirt on it. This was after not wearing makeup for the day.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,Excellent cleanser,"I love this cleanser! It feels that it does the cleaning thoroughly. The texture is wonderful and feels smooth and cooling on the skin. I use with another cleanser before it , but even if you just use this one cleanser, it will be enough."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,Easy to use,"I had to find an alternative face wash when the one (Shiseido Lucent Whitening) I've been using for the past 8 years stopped production. 

I'm picky and have tried a few brands in my attempt to switch over. This is by far the one that leaves my face squeaky clean - I know bad for you but I love the feeling. I use Clarisonic with this, and wash my face twice a day.

Will continue buying as my daily face wash."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Amazing product! Leaves face clean and feeling amazing
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,So far so good. I've used it three times in a row and all the same results. First time was after wearing makeup and other two were fresh faced. It makes my skin feel really clean and taught but not over drying! Feels like it's really working.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,nope,Not really a fan. This cleanser leaves my skin feeling tight and dry
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,I love this cleanser! I’m giving 4 stars cuz it’s not very foamy; it’s more creamy in my opinion but washes off easily and cleanly and it’s gentle yet effective
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,Ms,By far my fav foam cleanser ever! It’s cheap and works super well! Literally a pea size is enough to wash my super oily face. I love how it foams up especially when I coupled it with my Foreo device too. Have been repurchasing for years 👍
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,Love it,"I've tried Dr. Jart's face masks and loved it. So i decided to try out their facial wash. I have been using it since April 2020 and love it so far!
Smells good and cleans well! Definitely recommend this product."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,Good buy.,I like how it has an exfoliating feel while washing. Skin feels clean and fresh after using. It has a lychee-like scent which got me awhile to get used to. 
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,Digital Content Creator,"Amazing cleanser. Quick built up. Feel refreshed after one wash. Recommend to use only twice a day. It does tends to strip off natural pH, but great for deep cleansing."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Changed my skin,"I started using this cleanser while on a trip when I had forgotten my usual cleaner (CeraVe as recommended by my dermatologist) and had to resort to using my friend’s Dr. Jart Dermaclear foaming cleanser. I loved it so much I bought it by the end of the weekend. I never write reviews, but felt compelled after using this for a few weeks now and I can’t believe how much this changed my skin. It’s never been so clear and the texture is completely different - smooth, no more little bumps on my forehead, less redness. I also use it with the Micro Water (I use the micro water after the wash because I feel like the wash leaves a bit of residue, and then rinse the “water” off with water). I also started using the milk peel and wow — the three work together wonderfully. Highly recommend !!!"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,favourite! ,i have been using this product for about a year now and this is my 3rd time repurchasing it. definitely love the way it feels and how it makes my skin look after i wash up my face. i do not have any complains for this.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,must buy,I love this face wash. I use a few different brands. Tatcha  and Saturday skin. This is different how it’s goes on. It’s like Silk my face felt super clean and soft. And you could really feel it cleaning your face. Oh and for the price... tatcha 65-and this 22 bucks lol it’s really great.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,Keeps my skin supple,"After using this product for about a month, I can tell that my skin is less dehydrated. I use only a little for each wash, so I think this could keep me going for half a year or so."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,whats good for me might not be good for you,"use it with PH micro foam for a month. it smells like a grass jelly. really. but not in an annoying way.  i gave it to my man since it does make my face feels itchy every time i use it. then few pimples coming out. so i stop after a month. so far, he said he doesn’t feel itchy whatsoever. so lets wait n see if it work best for his skin. hey, what works for me might not works for u, right? so yeah"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Canada,Gentle and Practical,"This is a very simple cleanser. Moisturizing, non-drying and A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. You just needed a pea size of it and it'll definitely give you a good lather. It has MINIMAL scent to it but it didn't bother me at all. For the record, I DON'T WEAR FOUNDATION NOR EYE/FACE MAKEUP, I only wear EITHER tinted moisturizer or tinted sunscreen and an SPF loose powder that's all. It works really well for me as my second cleanser after my balm. It serves its purpose well for me hence I have already finished 3 tubes of this. It washes the sunscreen well and no residue left on my face at all."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,"I love this cleanser - I was hesitant to spend extra money on a face wash; however, I love Dr. Jart products so I wanted to try it out and it is WORTH IT. I only have to use a tiny amount to get a rich lather and my skin feels clean and balanced afterward. I wouldn’t use this cleanser at every wash however especially if you have sensitive or dry skin...definitely works best with a nourishing toner and a good moisturizer."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,A perfect gentle cleanser that minimizes acne as well as its scars without providing any further irritation to my skin. A perfect product for oily and unpredictably troubling skin like mine!
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,"Leaves my skin clean, fresh and balanced!","I have dry skin in some areas and oily in others. I am also prone to adult acne. I've never been able to find a cleanser that left my skin feeling clean. Although sometimes it has a drying effect, using Dr Jart's moisturizer/primer after leaves my skin perfectly balanced!"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Canada,Problematic skin? You have to try it!,This cleanser is awesome. You only need the tiniest amount to get a full lather. I purchased the full Dermaclear line and my skin is thanking me. I’ll definitely be repurchasing. Truly my new staple cleanser!
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Pretty good!,I have sensitive skin and use the cica line and this wash is really great you only need the tiniest bit to lather and it doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry or right. It’s a fave.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Canada,Made me break out,"I was so excited to buy this product because so many beauty bloggers were recommending it (but I guess they were paid for the ad). 
It literally does nothing - my face did not feel cleansed at all and I had to cleanse with another product afterwards. The worst part is that I started breaking out immediately after I used this product and I don’t even know why - I always check the ingredients before purchasing something. 
I really do not recommend this product and I wish I could return it but the stores are closed."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,"I was really excited to use this product. I thought the price point for it was a deal until I used it more than twice and suddenly it started extremely irritating my skin. My face was extremely red, too tight and dry."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Waiting for a partner as reliable as this,"Very FAVORITE face wash. I have rosacea and horribly sensitive skin and this does a great job cleaning my skin deeply without irritating any of my skin conditions. This face wash is the kind of boyfriend you’d feel safe bringing home to mom, and honestly, if they proposed early on in the relationship you’d say yes because they never once showed a sign of a red flag."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Singapore,no regrets getting this,was looking for an alternative facial cleanser for oily skin and chanced upon this. love the foamy texture and the squeaky clean feeling after washing. so far so good!

I feel like I don't need to apply moisturizer afterward and it also has pleasant clean fresh. A little goes a long way. Great fir night cleansing after removing makeup. Super affordable for it's qualities, highly recommend!"
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,better than Cetaphil,"i have cleared up my skin using Isotretinoin, however i could not find a cleanser that made me feel clean once my treatment was completed. like Cetaphil, cannot compare. this face wash IS THE BEST for acne prone skin."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Really difficult to squeeze product out,"This product does cleanse well. However, it is extremely hard to squeeze out of the bottle and leaves your skin feeling a little dry after you rinse off. Would not recommend for dry or sensitive skin."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Gentle but effective,Very gentle cleansing foam that leaves my skin feeling clean. I have sensitive + combination skin type and this is perfect for clearing pores yet gentle enough not to strip.

I like the smell I don’t think it’s weird like others have said and I’m funny with smells.  It is definitely hydrating not stripping at all.  I could go without moisturizing if I really wanted to.  I can be dry in the winter and oily in the summer so interested to see if I will will be too moisturized in the summer but until then I’m a fan!
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Hubby and I love it,"Really great product. Lathers like a gel, not like a soap with lots of bubbles. Leaves your skin feeling hydrated, almost like it has a layer of lotion on top. Made me feel really clean. Husband loves it too, great option for me who already love the Dr.Jart+ line of products."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Canada,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,This did a good job of cleansing my face however it did strip my skin after routinely using it. My skin felt like it was gone.
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,,No fuss cleanser,"Foams up easily and cleans well. I use it with my Foreo and it's been a good combo so far. I like that it's mild enough that it doesn't leave your skin dry or taut, yet heavy duty enough to get rid of waterproof makeup. "
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,Canada,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,"best deep but gentle foaming face wash. i love that it lathers so well and a little goes such a long way.

DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,Dr.Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,"I don’t normally review beauty products, so this is kind of a first for me, but this stuff is incredible. Don’t get me wrong, like everyone says, it smells real weird. Not necessarily bad, but definitely weird. HOWEVER, since I have added it to my routine, I have not had one single breakout. Even when I got my period a couple weeks ago, nothing. And usually I can tell it’s coming by the number of lurkers that pop up on my left cheek. But I swear this stuff has kept them at bay. It’s the only change I’ve made to my routine and it has had an incredibly positive effect. I use it after an oil-based makeup removing cleanse, and then follow that up with this cleanser. It means business, so make sure you moisturize after using it."
DR.JART+-Dermaclear Micro Foam Cleanser,USA,my favorite,"this stuff is awesome.  cleans really well, and a pea size amount cleans your whole face.  my favorite"
LAB SERIES-All-In-One Multi-Action Face Wash,Singapore,husband has been using this for years!,"My husband is not one who believes or uses expensive skin care products but this facial wash from Lab Series is an exception, and has been a mainstay for him for years.

SK-II-Facial Treatment Cleansing Gel,Singapore,SK-II always flawless ,Awesome product doesn’t dry out the skin after use and almost able to wash off most of the make up. Seems small package but still have more than half despite using twice daily for almost a month now. Worth the price 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Good,"Definitely a good product, doesn’t feel oily after wash like other double cleanser. I’m not sure whether it is capable of removing heavy make up but this is is good for removing sunblock. Not sure whether I will repurchase as I can buy other double cleanser with the similar result + cheaper price."

But is quite good , after washing will feel smooth and clean , Dane the smell was good 👍🏻"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Mild cleanser,"Didnt remove my makeup completely. Mild foaming power. Wasn’t memorable after finishing it, would not repurchase it given the price point. Its just ok ?"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Foam,"This is not foamy at all, it's very oily on my face even after washed with water. Not refreshing. At the end I used another cleanser. I'm disappointed. It is on the shelf untouched after that."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Fragrance in skincare,I like this cleanser as it leaves my skin clean after a day of wearing makeup. It did not make me break out but the fragrance bothered me a bit because I have sensitive skin.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Foam,Singapore,too moisture,is a little too moisture for 20+ years old skin. maybe it should be more suitable for aging skin. but after wash feel very good. the skin feeled very suppled and soft. 
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Foam,Singapore,This does not foam,Looking for a new foaming cleanser so i decided to try this one. Apparently this does not foam at all upon lathering with water. This is more like a cream cleanser which did not make my skin feel clean. 
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,ms,"I was looking forward to using this product however, it was just mediocre and did not see any great changes on my skin. if you do not mind a non lathering cleanser then this may be the cleanser for you as it does not foams or lathers up nicely, it feels more like a cream cleanser with slight beading that melts quickly onto your skin without any harsh abrasiveness.   "

The high-performance cleanser rinses easily and leaves skin feeling fresh and clean"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Foam,Singapore,so so ,"Not sure if I love it as much as the other Estée Lauder facial wash. Skin doesn’t feel dry after use, but it doesn’t feel entirely clean either. It’s gentle on the skin, but would rather purchase the Estée Lauder micro algae cleansing jelly instead."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Foam,,Good,"It is really very gentle, and good for sensitive skin morning use. Though it does not have foam, it can cleanse quite effectively. 30ml is just nice to bring for travel. However, I don’t quite like the smell. Still prefer SK-II and Decorte but they do not sell in travel sizes. "
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Foam,,Good product!,"I love how it does micro-cleanse my face but does not leave my skin feeling tight afterwards. The texture I could say is creamy, but not foamy. However, it turns yellow after a while though."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Foam,,Good,"Bought the travel size to try out before purchasing a full size item. Product was alright. I like the fragrance of it. Overall, just a simple cleansing foam, doesn't do anything special."

ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Foam,,Good,"I find this cleanser very mild and gentle. Very silky and smooth, doesn’t foam much, but it does cleanse well. Leaves skin soft and fresh without drying. "
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Foam,,great for night double cleansing,"I use it after using a deep cleanser to sooth my skin down for a mask after. it's not much of a foam cleanser, it's more of a gentle milk cleanser feel, I have combination skin and it does not break out my skin "
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Foam,,Content with my purchase ,"at first I was upset at the size of the product, but after using it I realised you didn't need much. It removes makeup great and I feel that it left my face with a slight glow. i have combination skin, and I felt like this product didn't leave me too oily unlike other products :) "
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Foam,,very good,"a very good foaming facial cleanser. no strong scent. foams well and did not dry or irritate my face. will defiantly repurchase in future.

CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,Foaming Cleanser,"Clinique foaming cleanser cleans my face thoroughly after my make up.  However, you will feel your skin a bit dry after using it. It's very effective in removing your make up and deep cleans your skin."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,Clinique foaming cleanser,"Effectively cleanse off all oils. But it doesn't suit normal combination skin like mine. It can be very drying with all traces of moisture and hydration removed, Dislike the awkward smell too. Wonder why there are so many good reviews"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,Clinique products are the best ,I really like using this. A great product to wash the day off without it feeling dry. I think Clinique’s products do no wrong and are great for every day use! But I think there are cheaper products out there that deliver the same results! 
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,convenient,"small size easy to bring around, and when use this i can skip my make up remover, this is strong and clean enough."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser,Australia,yikes!,This dried out my skin out so badly! Leaves an icky film on the skin after cleansing… it didn’t do a great job at removing makeup either. Wouldn’t buy this again 
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,very nice,clinique products are very nice and I've been using cleansers from this brand for so long. bit expensive for a cleanser but totally worth it. suits sensitive skin.

"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser,Australia,Squeaky clean skin - I'm in my mid 50's,"I use this in my night time skin care routine if its been a full coverage makeup day or night.  After using a makeup removing balm I cleanse with this. Sometimes I follow through with a double cleanse with another product (because I like to not because I  need to). This does an amazing job, doesn't irritate and a little goes a long way.  
When I've had a makeup free day or light coverage with a BB gel day I dont use it as it & instead use another product because this is a super cleanser and too much cleanse for daily pollutants in the air.
I am very happy with this product and have been using for over a year. "
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser,Australia,Good product,Clinique often goes unrecognised however their skin care products continue to impress

CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,No,This cleanser did nothing to remove traces of makeup. It left my skin feeling like it had a layer of thick plastic on it after cleansing. The liquid facial cleanser from Clinique definitely does a better job. Pass

CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser,,Does it's Job for Oily Skin,"I ended up buying this product because my usual Clinique Anti-Blemish cleanser (which I love) was out of stock. Didn't realize that this was more for normal skin. However, the product still works for oily skin like mine - you need very little as it lathers quite well. Giving it 4 stars as I find this to strip the skin oils slightly more than what I would like - the Anti-Blemish cleanser is milder on the skin."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser,,Perfect - does a very good job,"I use this everyday, especially after cleansing the face with the Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm . You only need a teeny tiny bit ( smaller than a pea size) of the product, it foams up very well and leaves skin clean without drying .

CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser,,so so cleanser,"This is a not-bad cleanser. But if compare with similar cleanser from other brands, I would prefer origin's frosty foam cleanser or chanel foam cleaser. All are about the same price, but better quality"

CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser,,all times favorite,all times favorite make up cleanser! i have repurchase many times! recommended  to me many years ago by my sister . Cleansing good enough and not over dry my skin! in future i will still repurchase this product
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser,,Great Makeup Remover,"An awesome makeup remover. Works well for eyeliner, mascara, even the waterproof types.

Has a nice fragrance and very suitable for sensitive skin.  It lathers easily and needs a few drops to clean the whole face thoroughly.

Recommended to use a face wash AFTER this product. "
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser,,Suitable for my sensitive skin,"My skin is super-responsive to things like changes in temperature, alcohol etc so am picky with what I cleanse with. I'm a long time user of Clinique skin care but their very mild cleansing milk isn't for me, and I don't like using cleansing bars. This cleanser is a little tingly on the skin at first but cleanses brilliantly. A quick sweep of Clarifying Lotion and Dramatically Different Moisturiser after that and I'm clean and happy."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Rinse-Off Foaming Cleanser,,Great cleanser.,"I repurchase this because i love how it cleanses my face. Clinique items never fail to make me fall for it. Therefore, i will always be repurchasing this. Bugger and last longer as you only need to use a lil ti cleanse ur face. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Prebiotic Clean Skin Gel Cleanser,Australia,gel cleanser,"Fantastic cleanser, is smooth on my skin and gets all of the makeup off, including my mascara which I’ve had trouble removing with other cleaners. Would definitely recommend."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Prebiotic Clean Skin Gel Cleanser,Malaysia,All in one.,Loved it! Great make-up remover. Great face wash. Skin looks fresh after wash. Value for money. Sustainable and highly recommended. Best so far. Replaced for AMA sephora face wash. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Prebiotic Clean Skin Gel Cleanser,Malaysia,Average ,"bought this after felt like fresh soya cleanser wasn’t helping much and the staff mentioned that this was good product. i felt like it’s tooo soapy, hard to take off and make my skin a bit drier. i came back using soya cleanser from fresh. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Prebiotic Clean Skin Gel Cleanser,New Zealand,Very Nice,"I really like this cleanser, it feels super gentle and doesn’t strip my skin. Can’t say I noticed much difference in my skin after using this, but it didn’t make my skin worse so that’s always a plus. The only thing I don’t like as much is that I have to wash it a few times before I feel like I’ve gotten all of it off my skin - but maybe what I’m actually feeling is the hydrating ingredients. I really like that this has probiotic ingredients and overall this is a really nice, gentle product that I would buy again. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Prebiotic Clean Skin Gel Cleanser,New Zealand,so good!,I love this product!! Leaves my face soo silky smooth not drying at all it’s just an all around great product. If you want a face cleanser that’s not super expensive and does the job plus more get this one 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Prebiotic Clean Skin Gel Cleanser,Australia,Really good cleanser! ,"Affordable and leave your skin with a nice sensation. I only use it at night and my skin loves it (combination skin, don't use much make up and prone to blackheads and pimples). My  pores are much more decongested. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Prebiotic Clean Skin Gel Cleanser,New Zealand,So this is how clean feels,"I think it's a good formula, non drying and doesn't leave that squeaky texture. It's light and odourless. I use it every day and it feels good on the skin when I apply the rest of my skincare
"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Prebiotic Clean Skin Gel Cleanser,Australia,fresh dupe but better???,I usually use the fresh cleanser but found a site that said this was a dupe! I actually like this one better and think that it has actually helped my acne prone skin calm down and clear blemishes. I also have sensitive skin and this works perfectly. Love the texture! Definitely a dupe for the fresh at at least half the price; love it 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Prebiotic Clean Skin Gel Cleanser,Australia,Great Stuff,I heard great things about this cleanser so I'm really glad I tried it. I'm not sure about the benefits in the long run but my skin reacts well to it so far. Might just be a regular purchase from me. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Prebiotic Clean Skin Gel Cleanser,Philippines,Ms,I purchased this product as an alternate to DE Beste. I have used this only once and so far so good. No bad or negative reaction. Its clean and doesn't feel heavy on the skin.Ill update my review soon when I use this product more frequently.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Prebiotic Clean Skin Gel Cleanser,Malaysia,A MUST HAVE FOR COMBI SKIN!,"I bought it because the salesgirl said it is new thing in store and gentle to skin. I love the ingredients which is Aloe Vera that soothing my skin.I have combination skin and dry sometimes.At first, my skin got purging on cheek. After few week using this my skin feels smooth and i notice dark spot also fade . I love this cleanser because I feel so fresh and it is fragrance-free which is very good to my skin! "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Prebiotic Clean Skin Gel Cleanser,New Zealand,sedhe,Very gentle on skin. Absolutely recommend . Product is affordable and leaves skin very clean and smooth without ripping off natural skin moisture.I am using it for almost 5 days now and my skin is more bright and clear then ever
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Prebiotic Clean Skin Gel Cleanser,Singapore,so far so good ,no complaints thus far. got it because it's clean product and wanted to try out a new facial wash. staff recommended it and so far so good. I have a dry combi skin and I'm in my late 20s. works well and doesn't dry me out. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Australia,cleanser ,"Fantastic cleanser, leaves my face feeling smooth and fresh. Other cleansers made my face feel dry after a wash but this cleanser is the best by far and also helped with my acne."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,JUST WOW! I finally found my forever cleanser!!,"First impression: I think I finally found my forever cleanser. This cleanser feels like it has been engineered to perfection. It has a very gentle scent, refined and more spall like version of tea tree oil scent. It feels soft on the skin, gel like. It does not strip my already dry face. I am so surprised at how well it removes make up, and for those who do the Korean skin care routine like myself, this is an excellent double cleanser after you do the oil cleanse. It removes any oil residue from the oil cleanser, without compromising the moisture. I highly recommend this for dry skin, I am definitely going to be using this every day and again I don’t think I will be trying anything else, I finally found a cleanser that works with my skin.￼"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,"Previously, I was using harsh acids with Retin-A. It was really damaging my skin, as Retin-A is strong enough. I switched to everything, including my cleanser, to be more moisturizing. This is a great cleanser that helps hold in the moisture your skin needs!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,decent cleanser if you like ylang ylang scent,this is a decent cleanser. nothing to rant and rave about. I would have given it four stars but I really dislike the smell - ylang ylang I think. not my taste.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Love this wash and a bottle of it goes farther than much of the competition.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,Cleanser,Purchased multiple times. Love the gentleness of the cleaner and that it comes in a pump bottle. Likely to repurchase again.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,This is my GO TO cleanser!!! I have been using it for the past couple of months and omg it has made me feel super clean but not leaving me feel stripped and dry. I will definitely repurchase!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Australia,Gentle on skin,"I find this provides enough lather to make my face feel clean, the texture is a little strange but I have had no problems with irritation or over drying the skin. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Great for sensitive skin!,"I use this in tandem with the Shiseido Cleansing Oil for my double-cleanse routine, and I love it! The smell is nice, a little mix of floral and medicinal. The consistency is a loose gel, so I think this would be a great option for anyone with oily skin. It lathers up well without being overwhelming, and one pump with water goes a very long way. I'm able to wash my face, décolletage, and ears with one pump, so I think it's very effective. 

I have pretty sensitive skin with acne, and it has not negatively affected me at all with this past month of usage."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,a solid cleanser option,"I've been using for two months as my morning cleanser after the gym. I really enjoy it, as it gets the grime off my face and helps me feel clean. It foams nicely, and the dry parts of my face don't feel stripped. The light scent is lovely! Overall, it does its job on the days I don't need to fight a breakout with a medicated wash."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,A Great Squeaky Clean,"This cleanser leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean without being stripping. Some cleansers make my face feel tight, but not this one. The smell is a little much, but please don't ask me to describe it; there are no words. Not that it is bad, but just strong. You get used to it though. I am sad that I am almost out of it, but it has last me for quite some time using it twice a day: morning and night. It has been almost two months and I still have at least 1 quarter of the bottle left. I will definitely re-purchase when I run out."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Nice and Refreshing but not good smell,"This product is the best! I have oily skin, so many pores, and acne. While using it, I must say feels so good and refreshing and after washing my face it was so nice and I did not feel dry. I only use 1 pump"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Great in My Double Cleanse Routine,I love this cleanser. I use it with the Biossance cleansing oil to double cleanse. It is super gentle and my face doesn't feel stripped of its oils and moisture when I use it (even if I'm lazy and don't use the oil first). I have dry/combination skin and it is exactly what I was looking for to use in my double cleanse.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Meh,"Cleans face but didn’t feel like it did much at all. As someone who gets a lot of acne breakouts & has huge pores, I definitely felt like I could be using many different products that could be helping actively with my issues. This kinda felt like I was wasting time."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Wanted to love it,"I did not notice any improvement on my skin what so ever, I didn’t like how it lathers on the skin either and overall did not minimize my pores or reduce any other skin concerns it claims to do"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,"Nice cleanser, fragrance warning","A great foaming cleanser! Bottle was easy to use, closed up well when traveling. I loved how clean it made my oily skin feel but I wouldn't recommend it to those with dry or sensitive skin because I can see how it could be stripping. It also had a lot of fragrance so I wouldn't recommend to those with sensitivities. I would love this product more without the scent. Overall it worked well and did good for my skin type."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,love this. it's super gentle and can be used as a second step in double cleanse or first thing in the am. I'm happy with this and would repurchase.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,After I used this product for a couple weeks can see the difference on my face. Looks better every day... this is a great product... 100% recommended
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Nope,Not sure what makeup this is supposed to remove but could not even get my NON waterproof basic mascara off.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,"It’s a great cleanser and removes most makeup as well, the only reason I didn’t give it a 5 is cos the smell is too strong for me."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,love,"absolutely love the texture and the smell, my forever wash now."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Highly fragrant and irritated my skin. Started having weird breakouts on my cheek and forehead. If you're sensitive to fragrance then be mindful of that.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Stinky Seaweed Smell,"After hearing so many great things about Biossance, I purchased a discovery kit and this cleanser was part of it. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get past the rotting seaweed smell to use it more than a few times. Worse, the stench lingers. My skin didn’t overreact or dry out with this cleanser - so that’s a positive note. In any case, it’s in the recycling bin now."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,New Zealand,combination skin,"feels great on the skin, does not fell like it strips the skin or feels tight, huge bonus to me! will buy again"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,one of the best cleanser right now!,"This cleanser does wonder to your skin and you will feel great using the cleanser. I got the full size after trying the samples and there is no going back. It does cleanse your face but it doesn’t dry it out, leaves your skin feeling supple. It smells amazing too!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,Gentle yet EFFICIENT!,"This is my first time trying Biossance product. I super love it gentleness, it does have a herbal kinda smell. Its very soothing smell i have no problem with it. It cleanse my face without drying or overstrip my skin. Been using this for 2 months. Im using it 2-3 times per day. I bet this whole bottle can last until 4-5months. I will repurchase this cleanser 😍"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Australia,Fabulous cleanser,"I love how gentle and effective this cleanser is. It removes all traces of oil and makeup from my face, but does not dry out my skin or leave it feeling tight. It’s particularly effective when I use it with my Foreo cleansing device. Will continue to repurchase. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,I previously used the jelly cleanser but I love this one even more. It lathers well and cleanses my skin better. Really like it!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,not the best…,"I really wanted to love this cleanser, but unfortunately it did not work out at all. The smell is overwhelming, and honestly I think it’s too fragrant and that’s what has been causing breakouts. Even though it’s a wash off treatment, I’ve noticed I’ve been getting really weird breakouts on my jaw and cheeks. My boyfriend actually has been using my cleanser without telling me and he even start developing acne on the lower half of the face too. It’s a shame because I love this brand, but highly recommend not buying this cleanser and going with something else."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Fragrance too strong!,"Nope! I use many of the Biossance products, but this one has too strong of fragrance. Also I have irritation on my skin after trying a little on my jawbone. All the creams I use from this brand are unscented so not sure why this smells like I’m repelling bugs."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,calms my skin down ,"Having frequent outbreaks nowadays, this cleanser calms my skin down and reduces the outbreak by almost 50%. Have already bought my second bottle to stock up! "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Not a fan,The scent is not enjoyable. This doesn’t make my skin feel stripped but bothers my eyes. I feel like I have to use a lot to wash off my balm cleaner.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Super nice GENTLE face wash,"I enjoy using this wash EXCEPT I feel like I have to pump mad times in order to get it nice & lathered up to where I feel like it’s actually cleansing my face. It’s so light and gentle I would recommend using it with a facial brush, foreo etc I use it with my foreo to help remove sunscreen and all of my products I had on throughout the day and it helps make my skin feel super clean without any dryness. Even without my foreo I just like to use it to ensure everything is removed. But yeah I actually kinda love it. You just have to use like 3 pumps lol"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,Good cleanser,It doesnt dry your skin. I still can feel softness after cleansing and you just need a little bit. My skin feel fresh after using it.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Australia,Love,Firstly this smells like marshmallows and musk to me which is really nice while washing my face. The cleanser itself is really good. Lathers nicely and leaves my skin so soft and clean but not that squeaky clean. 10/10
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,"Great cleanser, a little bit of an odd smell but doesn’t strip my skin at all."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,"Good, but not for me","I have a combination skin - oily forehead and dry cheeks. I was excited to use this cleaner because it was listed for sensitive skin. once I use this cleaner all the area around my go dry, it did feel refreshing. I tried to like it, but my skin around lips and cheek went dry. hope this is helpful for some one."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,feels so good on my skin. rinses off easily and removed my makeup well. i don’t really like the scent all that much thought
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,the only cleanser that’s worked for me,"If you have semi-oily skin, redness or are acne prone. BUY IT! It’s so amazing, hydrates my skin while controlling oil, helps with redness and has not clogged my pores. The only cleanser that’s worked and I will never change it. Yes the smell is strong but it’s clean and you get used to it! Amazing"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Tried lots of cleansers and this is my new fave. Gentle and moisturizing but does a good job cleaning off make up. Will repurchase
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,"It'll clean your face. Like, squeaky clean. I didn't wait to see if that would become problematic - returned it immediately. I have dehydrated oily skin and prefer something that doesn't leave a squeak."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Love this gentle cleanser for my combination skin! I have an oily t-zone and normal everywhere else. This cleanser has balanced my skin out evenly and gives my complexion a beautiful glow! My skin looks so clear and healthy. It took a few weeks for me to notice a difference! Try it out if you have normal or combination skin!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,not for me,"Really don’t like this but it’s a brand new bottle so I have to finish it now lol I have oily t-zone and normal everywhere else skin so I prefer a foaming cleanser, the lotion like cleansers are not for me. This one foams but not enough for my liking and what I dislike the most is the scent. It smells like rosemary, tea tree and lavender, very outdated ugly scent. I also don’t feel like it cleanses the skin well if you have layers of skincare and/or makeup. I haven’t tried to remove makeup with it but I tried it over sunscreen and it was literally like I had used air to remove the sunscreen because nothing happened. This is a good morning cleanser or night cleanser for people who use nothing but a moisturizer throughout the day. Definitely would not repurchase or recommend."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,not for dry or acne-prone skin,i love biossance but this cleanser doesn’t remove makeup (especially mascara) very well. it’s also very drying if you have dry/sensitive skin. im acne prone and don’t think this helped my skin very much. ended up returning
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,"Amazing. I am a very sensitive and redness probed skin so very picky with my skin care products. This cleanser is indeed very gentle and leaves my skin smooth, calm and hydrated, don’t even need to apply moisturizer right away. And it does a great job washing off make up and dirt with very little product."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,"I really like it! A comfortable cleanser that does a good job removing my normal light makeup. I like to switch up my cleansers but I can see myself buying this again in the future. I have acne prone, normal skin."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,Like this,this works for my combination skin - as a second cleanse.  Love the scent too. 4 stars as it could be cheaper. buy on sale
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,"Drying, too much fragrance & white heads","I got a small sample size a while back that I never tried.  So I decided to give it a whirl. I used it two nights in a row and not only did it dry out my skin, it had an a bearable amount of fragrance, and it caused whiteheads to start popping up. Now, I feel as though I’m doing damage control with my skin. I’m never using these products again. I wanted to like it but i just can’t recommend."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,New Zealand,Highly recommend ,"Love this! It's refreshing, calming and removes all your built up dirt and leaves your face feeling fresh and smooth. A bit pricey but a little goes a long way"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Highly Recommend,I have dry skin and This is an amazing product!! I alternate between this and a milky nonfoaming cleanser depending on how dirty I feel. To remove makeup I definitely suggest using micellar water or an oil based cleanser before hand.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Australia,Perfection in a bottle! ,"This is an amazing cleanser! The scent is divine, the packaging is perfection and the way it cleans the skin is exceptional - no stripping or drying it out at all. I have combination skin with an oily T-zone if that helps. Great product and well worth the money! "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Not for very dry skin,"I do not understand all the five star reviews, because my experience was exactly the opposite. If you have oily or normal skin I think this cleanser would do. but if you have dry to very dry skin, this is not the product. I tried this product for a week and every time I used it I found that my skin became even drier and felt extremely tight. I used it just as instructed on the package. it did cleanse my skin nicely, but stripped it of its natural oils. I am left wondering if this actually has any squalane at all. I was so excited to use this, but bummed now, especially considering the high price point."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,"Not a stand alone cleanser,maybe for a 2x cleanse?","Not a stand alone cleanser. I always need another one to strip off makeup, this one smears it around. The oil kind of burns your eyes. When using this to double cleanse you hope the oil will keep you from feeling dried out but I really did not see that with this. Love this brand but not this product."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,love it will buy again,I need the whole line of BOSSANCE I love this cleanser it does not dry out skin at all. My skin feel so calm after using
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,best cleanser ever for sensitive skin!,"15/10!! I am OBSESSED with this cleanser! I’m gonna start off by saying I’ve been so discouraged about finding a good cleanser for months and this is it!!

I was using VaniCream since my skin is super sensitive but I’d have to wash my face 4-5 times to just feel clean (even had to use an oil cleanser as well along with it) 

After my first use of this cleanser, i felt refreshed, soft, and CLEANSED. The fragrance is overwhelming sometimes, but it’s truly incredible. It’s been a month of me using it and my skin feels clearer as well. So good for sensitive skin + u feel the cleanser working, thank u Biossance!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,slight natural scent ,"Not exactly a stand out product… just meh to me… Gel texture, doesn’t strip the moisture out of my skin… it’s an okay cleanser nothing special to me… don’t think I’ll repurchase "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Works for my acne prone skin,I used this product for 6 months already and it's the only one for which my skin never had a bad reaction like a break out !
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,AMAZING,It gets better I promise! This cleared my acne in two days!!! I have been struggling with maskne for the past year because I can’t believe that wearing a mask for so long has affected my skin below my eyes. I have tried everything and this is my holy grail yall and I can remove makeup with this although they recommend the oil one but I’ll try that next. I love gel so this is by far my fave cleanser ever!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,"This was a nice gentle cleanser, but as for reducing acne scarring and helping with breakouts, I would say is minor. I have sensitive skin and felt like this had a stronger scent. It did not dry out my skin or cause any further breakouts so I’m sure it’s good for normal skin."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Australia,smells like a spa,i love the texture and smell! it cleans my skin really well and makes it fell clean without leaving it feeling stripped! 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,i love this product. gentle on the skin but washes away impurities. i have combo skin and need something gentle enough so it doesn’t cause irritations during other treatments and this does the trick!!!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Effective but drying,"I purchased this after reading the positive reviews for rosacea and acne. At first I found it to be a good cleanser in terms of removing my makeup, and calming the redness across my t-zone. Sadly, I found twice daily use to be very drying over the long term. Especially in the winter, my skin was left feeling pretty tight afterwards, so I had to switch to using this once a day only. A little annoying to have to have two cleansers in my bathroom, but will finish the bottle. Will continue to look for a cleanser that has cleansing, calming, and non-drying properties."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,A Truly Gentle Foaming Cleanser!,"I wish I'd come across this cleanser sooner than I did!  I have very red, reactive, combination skin, and when it's in flux, it can really overproduce oil.  This cleanser has helped balance my skin nicely.  A little goes a long way, and it rinses easily, leaving my skin feeling perfectly balanced and soft.  I've also been using it as a cleanser for my chest and arms, because of how well it works and how soft my skin feels after using it.  I'm definitely going to purchase this again."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Me and my husband love it!,"I bought this for myself because I like to use a gentle cleanser in the mornings. I have very dry skin, rosacea, and hormonal acne on my chin. I need something that won’t trigger my rosacea or irritate my acne, also without stripping my skin. This does a great job at doing all of that, and it has a very pleasant smell to it. The texture is really nice, gel at first and then builds to a nice small velvety foam. My husband saw me washing my face with this and was really interested in trying it. He has very oily skin and gets acne from clogged pores. I’ve tried getting cleansers for him for years but none of them were right for him so we gave up trying. He actually loves this cleanser and it got him into cleansing his face! He agrees that it does a great job with cleaning our pores without leaving our skin dry. I’m shocked that we’re able to use the same product on our faces since our skin is so different, but it goes to show how great of a product this is. Truly a miracle worker!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,AMAZING,10/10 recommend!!! They best cleanser I have ever used and will continue to use it works so good for me my skin looks so amazing now
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,New Zealand,Great daily cleanser,A little goes a long way. Does not leave skin dry or feeling tight after use. Can use twice a day without causing irritation. Removes sunscreen and also mascara. Would recommend as a first step in a double cleanse. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,I use a lot of high-end cleansers. This one has been a winner. I cleanse with oil and follow with this one (one pump only). Excellent consistency and quite gentle.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,"This is the my first step in the morning, and the last step at night as part of my beauty routine! I’m totally and completely hooked. I’ve repurchased this cleanser several times, and I even put a little water in the bottle to get the last drop. It is so gentle, doesn’t burn my eyes, doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight, and skin feel’s moisturized."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,A MUST HAVE!!!! LOVE!!!,The best gentle non drying cleanser smells herbal and fresh!!! It reminds me of the Youth to the people but without the overdrying of the skin I find that one drying. This is just super deeply cleansing and gentle at the same time. You need it!!!!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,So nice,Lovely product. Makes me feel like I’m at a spa. Gorgeous smell.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,buy immediately,I absolutely love this! My face feels clean without drying out and I love the smell! Almost like being at the spa. Biossance does it again!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Love,"this cleanser not only leaves your face feeling clean without drying it out, but you smell like you are at a luxurious spa"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Great product. It doesn't dry your skin. I love the smell.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,I have combination skin in the winter - oily skin in the summer ! This product is great. Might not be gentle enough for dry/super dry skin though
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Love it!,"A little goes a long long way! Feels great on my skin, and always leaves me squeaky clean without making me feel SQUEAKY clean."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Love this! It’s super gentle yet makes you feel like you get a good clean.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,"This is great! It's a gel cleanser that's super gentle, but effectively wipes off makeup"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,all thats missing is the spicy salmon roll,"I can not get past the smell of this product. I used it twice and had to return it. It smells strongly like the pickled ginger and wasabi paste they include with sushi rolls. If you can get past that part, i’m sure its a good basic gel cleanser"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Great Cleanser,"This is a good cleanser for dry skin. It’s gentle, it lathers well and my skin feels really clean after! I have noticed a reduction in breakouts which is great. I don’t love that it’s got fragrance in it, but it’s a wash off product so I don’t find it irritates my skin."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Super Gentle!!,I love the scent and how gentle it is. I have normal to dry skin and I usually prefer cream cleansers but this one is super smoothing and gentle. My skin never feels dry or tight after using. Will be repurchasing!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,"Love the subtle scent, reminds me of a spa or yoga studio scent. Gentle but effective foamy face wash. Will buy again!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Excellent,Very gentle on the skin.. Not at all harsh. Perfect for daily use
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,"My new all time favourite cleanser. Gentle, effective, lovely little foam, intoxicating (but not overpowering smell) and it leaves my skin soft."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Best hydrating cleanser for combo skin,"I rarely write reviews but I read many of them before I buy products and I have to give this cleanser 5 stars!! Not only did this cleanser tackle my stubborn blackheads on my nose but it’s so hydrating!! The smell is absolutely invigorating and I can FINALLY say I found my staple cleanser.

P.S The hype is real!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Gentle + Powerful,I've tried many cleansers...MANY cleansers but this one is only of my absolute favorites. It just .... gets the job done. Its gentle enough to not strip your skin yet powerful enough to erase makeup. My skin feel clean and refreshed after I use this cleanser
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,simply not for me.,"just not in love. if you’re looking for something very very gentle, clean and lightweight this is for you. i’ve been using it for a week now and it’s not for me. i prefer something that foams up or produces a richer lather, the scent is a little too ‘green’, & i don’t feel all that cleansed after use.  All in all if you have skin that is mad at you, or sensitive skin, this might be more up your alley."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Look No Further !!,BUY IT! I have struggled with hormonal acne as a young adult and have tried every product possible when it comes to cleansers. I am the type of person who will scroll through all the reviews and comments before buying a product and I truly love this product. Some cleansers can make your skin oily or super dry but this cleanser is a happy medium. It makes my skin feel clean and soft. I use it in the morning and at night and I love the gel like consistency. It has not only helped clear my acne but as well as helped with acne scars. A must have!!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,So far so good!,"I’m very pleased with this cleanser! I had been using something else for a long time, which I realized may have been too drying/stripping. So I’ve been wanting to try some Biossance products for a while and this did not disappoint! I also have sensitive skin and I didn’t have any bad reactions. My skin feels clean, soft and hydrated after cleansing daily!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Gentle and good foaming cleanser,I’m on my second bottle. This cleanser is very very similar to the Youth to the People Superfood cleanser but I find it is less drying on my skin personally (probably because of the squalane). It’s cheaper than the YTTP cleanser as well and the scent is very mild.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,"I miss the cleanser that came in a tube. I really like this one and how it doesn’t dry my skin which most cleansers do, however - I find it takes a lot of product to wash my face so the bottle goes quickly. The old formula used to last me way longer. I find this jelly like formula also slips off my face before I can even foam it up so I loose a lot of product as well. Please bring back the old cleanser!!!!! That was my ultimate #1 favourite, zero complaints about that one!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,astonishing,"Doesn’t strip✅ Smells great✅ No irritation✅ basic ✅ Lather✅ Hydrating✅ it’s a basic cleanser and it’s become one of my favorites as of now!! If you YTTP cleanser, this one is so similar!! but better!!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Philippines,The Best Cleanser!,"This is honestly the best cleanser I’ve ever tried. I was hesitating at first because it is a bit pricier than what I used before but it is worth it and a little goes a long way. I have dry skin and this worked wonders on it! My skin didn’t feel too dry after washing with it and it felt like it normalized the oil production. My skin now feels and looks healthier! It didn’t break me out, it even calmed down the small pimples that I previously had. Please don’t ever discontinue this! I am inlove with this brand ❤️"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Australia,Ouu ,"So, I bought this for aesthetic reasons mainly haha but the product is not bad. It does what it says it does which is a very gentle cleanser, leaves my skin feeling so soft after using it. But it’s a little pricey. I thought it was a glass bottle that’s why the price point was like that. But it’s plastic. So, it’s up to the person who is willing to spend that much on the product but overall I like it "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Philippines,ok,As cleanser it’s okay. Nothing ground breaking. I bought this coz I thought the price was alright but It doesn’t foam much so I tend to use more I’m not intending to repurchase. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Spa in a bottle!,"The best facial cleanser I have ever used!  This will be my forever cleanser. It is literally spa in a bottle…from the beautiful smell, to the luxurious lather, and leaves my skin feeling and looking amazing!  I gifted this to my adult children and their partners for Christmas…they love it too!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,simply amazing,"One pump is enough. Such a good cleanser, much better than the jelly."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,love it,"Says it’s for dry skin type, but I have oily and acne prone skin and this helped with my acne. I needed a basic “plain” face wash that didn’t have any harsh ingredients and this helped with my skin tremendously!! Probably the only face wash I’ve used that didn’t leave my skin feeling stripped after using. Oily skin needs hydration too. I highly recommend this for oily skin."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,My favorite,Been using this for a few months now. I love it. my face feels clean and doesn't cause any issues on my face.  lasts a good while too
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,"just ordered my second bottle of this face wash. This is new #1, favorite face wash. 
For a long time I was a fan of Youth to the People faces wash (which is still great!) but this is better for my skin!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Amino Aloe Gentle Cleanser,"So impressed!!! Wasn’t expecting much from this, as expensive cleansers usually don’t tend to do much for me aside from what a drugstore cleanser does. I have dry skin and was SO pleasantly surprised. Removed my full face of makeup well and left my skin noticeably smoother!! Biossance has been knocking it out of the park for me lately. Definitely worth the money"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Creme Cleanser/Moisture Mask,Malaysia,estee lauder,This product is really amazing. Can see satisfy results within 2 weeks. Really love the texture of really light and easily to wash off. The scent smells really good and it refreshes my day everyday. 
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Creme Cleanser/Moisture Mask,Singapore,Imma Super Dry Skin in aircorn room.,"I almost spend my holiday in aircorn trim during quarantine. My skin tare down especially my nose. This product help very well. Very moisturising, smells very good. Highly recommend for dry skin to own this amazing product. Normal it once a week will do but Super dry skin maybe twice a week. I believe it does help to lock the water in your skin, but the most efficient way is to drink more water."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Creme Cleanser/Moisture Mask,,Would not purchase again,"It smells great but that's all that's good about it. While using it, i can't help but feel like im putting oil on my face and as with all oil based product, it leaves your skin feeling like there's a layer of oil on it. Not my favourite facial wash or mask."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Creme Cleanser/Moisture Mask,,an ok product.,"This Estee Lauder's Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Creme not my really one of my fav  but its still ok for me. It leaves
my skin feel clean after wash and
 the smells is very nice .furthermore it's does not causing any bad side
 effect on my skin . "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Australia,Amazing,"Not many products can keep my oil under control during a full day, smell amazing and last forever.

For work I need to have a full face of makeup in air conditioning and no matter how hard I looked no cleanser could maintain the matte finish through the day and night. Thankfully a staff member recommended this one and I haven’t looked back since. One tube goes a lonnnnng way and smells amazing. Definitely coming back to this one!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Australia,nah,If you don’t have sensitive skin like me then I think this would be a great product. However I broke out like crazy after using it consistently for about 6 weeks :(
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Canada,Ole Henriksen Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser - 150ml,Amazingggg! Love using this after workouts and during the summer times! Definitely helps me with oil control!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,USA,Staple item,Holy grail for me! Doesn’t try out skin and has glycolic acid which works well with my skin. A little drop goes a whole way.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,New Zealand,My go to ,This cleanser is great for my combination skin prone to pimples. Leaves skin clean but not stripped. This is my third purchase and even when I go and buy something else to try always coming back to this one.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Canada,New Go-To Cleanser!,I've been using this almost daily and it has become a new favorite! I really love the smell and how soft it makes my skin feel.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Australia,best for Comvination skin,"i have used many cleansers but this works best on my skin with moisturiser as well... now want to try its toner cozz i have acne prone skin, hope it will works."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,New Zealand,Really nice cleanser,Lovely cleanser. I use this in between my Knockout cleanser by Tarte and the two compliment eachother really nicely. was also really good when used with the matching toner and moisturiser 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,USA,Just okay,I really wanted to love this. I have very oily and acne prone skin. This helped with my oily face tremendously but it did nothing to help with my breakouts. They didn’t get worse once the purging was done but they never went away
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,USA,Ole Henriksen Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser - 150ml,I’ve had problems with acne for years and am always so scared to try a new product but this actually helped clear it a lot
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,USA,OK cleanser,I switched from Murad to this cleanser and noticed that my cystic acne did not improve and I still had significant oil in my T zone after weeks of use. The product has a nice scent but didn’t quite work for me.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,New Zealand,miss,It does work! Used it for about a month to see clear results. My pores appear a lot smaller and has a menthol feel to it as well. Perfect for getting makeup off and doesn’t leave my face feeling cracked and dry after using. You only need a small amount each use so the 150ml last awhile. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Australia,Perfect for my skin,I have combination skin and I really feel this cleanser takes out the oil and it keeps it away for a long time. It really works for me compared to other brands I have used in the past
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Malaysia,It was so-so,Been using it a few times but I have yet to see my skin reduces oiliness. Will continue to use and monitor. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,USA,Holy Grail,This product is one of the keys to getting/keeping my face clear. I started using this a couple of years ago after a sales member recommended it to me. I've tried other cleansers since and nothing has compared. I love the smaller trio size as well because they are a perfect way to take your favs while traveling and not skip a beat in getting an amazing cleanse.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,USA,Ole Henriksen Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser - 150ml,"Cleanser is great with the toner. However, not my fave when it comes to fully cleansing the skin on its own. It does help with oil and keeps things matte. Unsure if I will buy again due to the price point and effectiveness."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,USA,Ole Henriksen Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser - 150ml,Love this cleanser!! It’s so refreshing & cleans but doesn’t leave my face feeling stripped which has been a challenge for my oily skin! I can’t say anything bad about it I will keep repurchasing!!!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,USA,incredible face wash!!,This has been my boyfriends ride or die face wash since we began dating 6 years ago. I couldn’t tell you what bottle number he’s on. When he runs out he will try others but nothing compares to this! When we first began dating he had oily acne prone skin. Since using this he has none-barely 1 breakout on random occasions. I highly recommend this face wash!!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Malaysia,just okay,"it is expensive for what it is. i think we can buy any products thats same as 'tea tree' at any drugstore for way more cheap than this. 

the good thing is the smell is refreshing "

OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Canada,literally incredible!!,This is the best cleanser if you have oily skin!! I’ve tried so many other cleansers and I always come back to this one!! So amazing and it feels so nice and incredible!!! I cannot recommend it enough
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Canada,Not too bad,Didn’t work for me. My skin problems were still the same nothing really changed for me apart from that it’s a good cleanser.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,USA,Ole Henriksen Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser - 150ml,"I love that my face actually feels clean after using this cleanser, not stripped. It does take a bit of time to work it into a lather but it doesn't dry out my face and the smell doesn't bother me."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Australia,Nice But Not Amazing,"it's a nice face wash, you only need a little bit to wash your face. It has a pleasant peppermint smell, and I do like it but I don't think I'll re-purchase as it doesn't seem to control oil too much for me."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Australia,refreshing n soft ,"leaves your skin feeling refreshed without drying out the skin, great for everyday cleanings or for double/ second cleanse to remove make up minimal smell and does the job with care not leaving skin feeling dry or tight "

OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,New Zealand,My go-to cleanser,This has a lovely minty scent and leaves my face feeling clean and soft.  It definitely helps a lot with my oil levels too.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,New Zealand,Harsh on the skin.,This along with the other Ole Henriksen products were very harsh on my skin and unfortunately made my skin worse so I have switched to K beauty products. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Singapore,spicy on eyes ,"when used, this gets into eyes and nose areas, feels spicy. I need to close my eyes very tightly and hold my breath for a while. does a little to help oily skin and control the oil for a while."

It helps keep my skin for getting super oily throughout the day and makes my skin feel super soft. This is a must have in my books
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Canada,Mattifies Beautifully,"I’ve tried a lot of different oil control products, including the highly raved Cerave. But it never helped keep me matte for more than an hour or two. I tried the small bottle of olehenriksen cleanser and my skin stays wonderfully matte throughout the day! I pair it with the ordinary oil control moisturizer and it’s a great combo for oily skin!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Australia,it goes a long way but I can't use it every day,"can dehydrate a bit: um using this to my advantage by popping on the oiliest and least like, bouncy-hydrated parts of my face. really can require a wash cloth or similar to gently exfoliate, makes skin sort of flat... squamous even... if not manually doing that. I can't use it over my sinuses though or my skin dries out. complicated! but I wish this line would stay forever because it's kind of working for my face."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Singapore,Pretty Good,I have been using this for about 3 weeks now. Face feels really clean and fresh after however not too sure about how it helps my oily skin. My skin still gets oily at the end of the day.

OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Australia,New to face cleaning ,This has been great! my face is sensitive and it has been helping my breakouts 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Canada,Helps with my oily skin,"I am extremely oily on my nose and chin area, but normal on the forehead and cheeks area, so I usually buy products for oily or combinational skin. I do not consider my skin to be sensitive. It made my nose and chin nice and clean and it helped with the oiliness. For my forehead, it dried it up right after using it and made it flaky, so when i rubbed it little skin flakes would fall out. This only happens if I waited more than 10minutes to continue the rest of the routine. I did not mind it because this was instantly solved after using any toner or moisturizer, and it did not cause any long-term irritation. This cleanser, as long as I followed up with any toner or moisturizer, made my skin soft and nice, my face would not be as oily nor it would get dry for the rest of the day. I have repurchased it"

OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,USA,my skin doesn’t feel clean after,"I really liked this at first, except for the consistency. It’s really thick. It seemed to clean my skin until a couple weeks later. Now it dries out my skin, but somehow I also have acne."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,USA,Dont understand the hype with this,"I was impressed when I first got this. I have combo skin and can get greasy at times. This kept it as bay for a week when first started using. Now I cant tell a difference. My pores are the same size, still oily and still have break outs. 

Worst side effect, which I believe may be due to this face wash is my eyes are always red now. My eyes are no longer clear and really dry but this all happended when first started using this product. So it seems very irritating to eyes, or at least for me."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,New Zealand,love ,I freaking love this product hence why I got the big bottle it removes all the sebum from my skin and I wake up with super soft skin. All my bumps disappear with it too.I’m so glad I purchased the small one to see how it went

Weird hand soap pearly texture.

Just ok - not offensive but in no way good. Love the Ole vitamin C range, will be sticking to that.
"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Canada,Great for my adult acne & large pores.,Finally bought the large size after getting the small one twice! I notice a difference with my pores being smaller and less acne too. The eucalyptus smell is very refreshing - but also intense! I like it but if you don't enjoy that scent beware. This is now the only face wash I use.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,Canada,works,I have extremely oily skin. This does the trick without over drying.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Find Your Balance Oil Control Cleanser,USA,Great cleanser!,"This cleanser was perfect for cleaning my skin while not drying out my sensitive, drier areas. Would definitely buy again.

I bought this for my girlfriend as she has more oily skin, whereas mine is more mixed to dry, and nevertheless we both agree that it does the job well, is very well priced and smells great with a mint-like finish that feels clean and fresh. Always happy with this company’s products, however I tend to go for the more expensive stuff and generally get better results. If you’re looking for reasonably priced, good products, OLEHENRISKEN will not let you down and will provide you with solid results. Love trying out these different products and will continue to give everything I try a fair shake."
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,Malaysia,Basic cleansing gel ,This is a normal basic cleansing gel . I used it at morning cleaning route. It a so-so product and more suitable to dry and sensitive skin type. I will not repurchase again in future. 
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,Singapore,not drying ,Mild cleanser that serve the purpose to cleanse and does not dry out the skin. Doesn’t foam and hence it will not give you the tight feeling after washing. Will buy again especially when skin is sensitive. 
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,Botanical Facial Gel,"I've been using this product for 8 months now and it is really gentle on the skin, it reduced the oiliness of my T-Zone, especially on my nose and also reduced my pimples keeping it smooth but the down side is that it dried and tightened my skin but overall, still a great product. "
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,Not For My Preference,"I guess this would be a good-enough facial cleanser for people who don't like ""bubbly"" cleansers. Personally, I like it when my cleanser produces foam. This is exactly why this product didn't work out for me."
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,doesnt really work on me,I’m really oily on my t-zone. Especially my nose and between my brows. Been using this for 5 months now and i dont really notice a difference. Maybe i should use it for a longer time? 
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,gentle ,Love how this facial cleanser is gentle on skin.. has a very clean scent but not too strong that it feels like a sterile product. Effectively cleans the skin but doesn’t dry it out. Also leaves skin feeling quite soft.
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,i dont like this,"i dont like this cleanser, or maybe i am just used to cleansers that makes my face feel clean. this does not provide the lather that i like and its really warm on your face. "
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,Break Out,"I thought this product is mild as it is also in gel form, but no, it brought me to my long lost friends, my high school acne. Mario Badescu Botanical Facial gel is not for me."
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,So so,Won't repurchase. Big bottle but stings eyes. Smells nice but didn't really clean face well either. Not the most effective cleanser. Others from the same brand are more effective. 
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,great for sensitive skin,"Mild and gentle formula for sensitive skin! Cleanse the face gently, doesn't dry out the skin and does what it says though it does not do extra work but it definitely helps to keep the problems by the bay."
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,Does the job,Been using the cleanser for a while now and am  almost till the end. It smells nice and does the job well I.e. cleansing the skin. For those who likes the lathering of a cleanser - this is not for you. It's a light weight cleanser for daily morning cleanse and night time cleanse after a thorough make up removal.
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,husband loves it!,"I’ve tried for one or two times and don’t really like it because my skin still feels like it’s not clean enough. Maybe because I’m wearing makeup.

However, my husband really love this cleanser and been using it everyday. His acne skin is getting better from day to day. I guess it depends on individual. What works for him might not work for me, vice versa. Depends."
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,good,Im loving this item so much as this facial wash suit me well. With no bubbles i consider this facial wash as the best to avoid clog on my skin. Recommended to use morning and night. Use with cleansing tool will be the best.
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,So-so cleanser,Bought this during a sale. The bottle is quite big but I tend to use a lot of product since this doesn't bubble up so I think the bottle would last me about 3 months with everyday use. I don't hate it but I won't repurchase. Stings my eyes and doesn't give that clean feeling after washing my face. It's probably good for those with sensitive skin tho. 
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,Botanical facial gel,"Decided to give this a try after I finished the Enzyme version. Loving it so far as it cleanses without drying out my skin. I'm used to non-soapy gels - in fact prefer cleansing washes without them. Likely to repurchase as its cheaper than the Peter Thomas Roth facial gel that has similar ingredients and so far, similar results."
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,ms,"This is a non foaming facial cleansers, not freaking me out as I used to have cetaphil as my daily cleanser. even thou it’s non foaming , I can still feel my face is squeaky clean after cleansing . People that are used to using foaming cleansers might take some time to  get used to it "
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,Love it,"Great texture- it does not foam as it's a gel. Totally is not harsh, does not dry out the skin at all. I find that it gives a very smooth afterfeel. I have been using it for a few days and i just love the subtle scent. My skin type is oily."
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,Love it!,"Firstly, the smell is amazing. It literally smells like you've stepped into a flower garden. I like the smooth non-sticky texture! It cleanses very well and removes my make up easily. I don't feel the need to use a soap-based facial wash using this product!"
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,so so product ,"i like the texture of this gel, but it didnt really do much to my skin so i was quite bummed as i had my hopes high for this product. as it is pricey and im broke, i just used the whole tub so that my money doesnt go to waste hahaha"
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,HG cleanser,"A very mild cleanser, non-harsh. I have oily to combo skin and am very concern about using very harsh cleansers...especially foaming cleanser. Bought this out of impromptu. Been using this for 5 months, on and off with Clarisonic. Loved the fresh feeling without being too squeaky clean or dry after wash."
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,Good cleanser for oily skin,"I used up a whole bottle of this. It's has a soap-free formula. So it's good for oily skin without making it excessively dry. It also doesn't give my skin a taut feeling after cleansing, which I enjoy. Makes my skin feels clean without overly drying. Doesn't really do much to prevent breakouts though. Maybe my acne is just too persistent. It's a good size too. Might repurchase this."
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,Gentle Cleansing,"This facial gel does not foam much so sometimes you may be unsure of whether you've cleansed thoroughly, but I like the fact that it is very gentle, and surprisingly if you massage it onto your face with water longer it removes makeup as well!"
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,Nice scent,I love the mild scent. It is a gel texture oily base. Great at removing make up. But I would recommend to use it with clarisonic. It doesn't work by just using hands to rub against your skin. Great product no doubt but orange cream cleanser works much better. 
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,Mario Badescu Botanical Facial Gel,This is a refreshing oil controlling cleanser. It is non-foaming gel cleanser is deep cleansing and refreshing for oily skin. Bought this for my sister who has oily to combination skin.Works great on oily skin but I shall recommend once per day usage if you have sensitive or dry skin.
MARIO BADESCU-Botanical Facial Gel,,Gel face wash ,"Didn't expect this product to not lather at all! It is really pure gel. It has a nice natural scent and didn't dry my skin, but I had to use a lot of product to get my face feeling clean - I have oily skin. "
PIXI-PinkSalt Cleansing Oil,Singapore,pink,"regular use has even helped keep clogged pores at bay: ""It has helped tremendously with sebaceous filaments and leaves my skin feeling incredibly clean after my second cleans"
PIXI-PinkSalt Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Great multipurpose oil! ,I use this on my neck/arms and on my face when I need to do a double cleanse! really great decongestant for the pores due to the salt! Helps with the bumps/discolouration on my arms a little too from KP! Very detoxifying! Use as the 1st cleanse of a double cleanse routine followed by a regular gel/foam or cream cleanser! 
PIXI-PinkSalt Cleansing Oil,Singapore,it works,love the feeling after cleansing because it is not sticky and there is no residue left behind! unfortunately i’m not really a fan of the scent and the salt chunks tend to clog up the pump.
PIXI-PinkSalt Cleansing Oil,Singapore,cool,"lightweight  oil applies to the skin with a moisturising oil texture to create a smooth and glowing finish. Enriched with pink salt love it look very pretty too
"
PIXI-PinkSalt Cleansing Oil,,"No results, not worth the money",I wish I could give it 0 stars because it really didn’t do anything to my face! The consistency was weird and there was no proper instructions on how to actually use it. First thought was that it looks nice and different but really it’s not worth the money and the smell is too strong. Would not recommend or repurchase this.
PIXI-PinkSalt Cleansing Oil,,Interesting product,i like this not super oily cleanser for skin. Skin is not dry or too oily after washing. i hope it can clear up my skin. Good price for such a product. I wish it is in a lighter packaging tho!
PIXI-PinkSalt Cleansing Oil,,Always some product left on skin,"Bought the cleansing oil a few months ago. I’d been using it to remove my waterproof liquid lipstick. Despite vigorous rubbing, it always left some product behind. It was very obvious because I use dark lipsticks. 

I thought it was just something I had to live with, since cleansing oils are supposed to dissolve makeup easily. My lipstick is pretty hardcore! However, at the recent Sephora sale, I decided to pick up the Clinique ‘Take the day off’ cleansing balm. Holy moly, I found a winner! The “paste” easily melted off my lipstick, with just gentle massaging. Don’t waste your money buying the Pixi oil. "
PIXI-PinkSalt Cleansing Oil,,moisturising,"I use this as a daily cleanser at night after I remove my makeup with micellar water. it hydrates the skin and gives it a soft supple finish. it also has a lovely scent that I like. I find that it removes traces of any mascara that remains, which is particularly useful for those longwear mascaras. "
PIXI-PinkSalt Cleansing Oil,,Too Oily for Me,"I find this a bit too oily for my skin. After cleansing off with water, the oil still sticks to my face, very much unlike any other cleansing oils I have used before. The product smells off to me. This is definitely not for me. Might be more suitable for matured skin."
PIXI-PinkSalt Cleansing Oil,,Helps me with my ance,"Helps to reduce my pimple, acne and it scars. Such a life saver and it is worth its price. Definitely would buy it again. Highly recommended for people who is struggling with pimple, acne and  it's scars"
PIXI-PinkSalt Cleansing Oil,,good cleansing product,"This is the best cleansing oil I have ever had. The formula is nice, not sticky, and remove make up really quick. For the price is also good, not too pricey for the ingredients and performance."
PIXI-PinkSalt Cleansing Oil,,Pink salt for detoxing,"I heard that pink salt is great for detoxing. So when i first saw this ingredient in cleansing oil, I am so tempted to try. You can cleanse and detox at the same time. I found my skin to be clearer and felt cleaner."

For so long i was with tatcha, and recently i decided to change and wow i am not disappointed at all!
A must have in my routine clearly!"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Mattifying Facial Cleanser,Philippines,not mattifying ,not mattifying but a decent cleanser and seems not to irrititate due to its mildness. it has thick consistency so a little does go a long way. cheaper alternative for mild cleansers
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Mattifying Facial Cleanser,Philippines,LOVE,I love this. I now have an alternative cleanser to my Indi Lee one. Perfect for someone with sensitive skin and very little goes a long long way. Definitely recommend.  
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Mattifying Facial Cleanser,Canada,Great Product,Removes makeup really well! My breakouts are gone after a week of consistent use. Highly recommend if you have an oily T-zone.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Mattifying Facial Cleanser,Canada,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Mattifying Facial Cleanser,I got this product from the salon I work at and I love it. It’s great if you have oily and acne prone skin. It remove makeup like no other cleanser I’ve used and leaves a squeaky clean feeling on your skin. If your pores get clogged easily then this product is for you!! I’d say I’ve seen results after a week and my skin feels so clean!
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Mattifying Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Meh,Did not really do much for my skin..... probably had too high expectations lol~ For now I am just gonna find and maybe switch to another cleanser......
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Mattifying Facial Cleanser,Canada,Awesome cleanser for oily skin!!!,"Love this cleanser. Left my skin feeling very clean, but not dry at all, and left no residue. I used it with the mattifying moisturizer and I can definitely say my skin is less oily. Will keep using"
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Mattifying Facial Cleanser,Canada,YES,Wish this came in mega size. Feels so fresh and clean. Using purity cleansers for years now.
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Mattifying Facial Cleanser,Canada,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Mattifying Facial Cleanser,"I would say this product is OK. I was using some generic neutrogena cleanser before that made my skin feel incredibly tight and dry. I switched to this and do not get that at all. I wouldn't say it does much to help minimize pores, but its not super drying which is great! Since I have combination skin its difficult to pinpoint exactly what makes my skin too dry vs too oily and I have not noticed any negative effects of this product. I'd say its a great escape from your nightmare cleansers but again, nothing too life changing."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Mattifying Facial Cleanser,Canada,Nothing Special,"I’ve been using this product for about 8 months and unfortunately I haven’t noticed anything special about this cleanser. 
I suffer with brutal hormonal acne and I found that this product gave me more blemishes and didn’t clean out my pores despite my using facial tools."
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Mattifying Facial Cleanser,Canada,really nice cleanser,Leaves my skin feeling really clean but not dry or tight at all. Also doesn’t break me out! Will be sticking with this cleanser from now on
PHILOSOPHY-Purity Made Simple One-Step Mattifying Facial Cleanser,Canada,Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Mattifying Facial Cleanser,"Really love this cleanser! With maskne, my face was a wreck, but this helped clear it up along with the Sephora Clarifying Pads! I have combo skin and this did dry me out a tad, but that is to be expected with a matte cleanser."
GALLINÉE-Perfume Free Cleansing Bar,Singapore,gentle and super good for acne prone skin !!,It’s a face and body cleanser but I only use it on my body. It’s gentle yet cleansing and it works really well with my slightly acne prone chest and back area. I find that I do not get any active body acne or breakouts when using this. Plus it’s fragrance free !! Doesn’t leave that tight feeling that most bar soaps do and :). Giving it 4 stars because it runs out quite fast . 
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Worth the money,"Never thought it can be last be last this long, love the smell and texture, and very gentle to my skin, would definitely buy next time. "
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Product is drying on skin,"After using this facial wash, my skin feels tight and dry. I would not be repurchasing it. It’s unfortunate as I use other Lancome products and didn’t have any issues. "
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Worth to buy,This cleanser is suitable for me as my skin will not be very dehydrated after used this. It can cleanse my face wisely and not make my face become sensitive.
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,So so….,This cleanser doesn’t cause any problems to my combination skin but I don’t see any result after using it for 2 weeks. I will not purchase this again.
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Love this cleanser,Have been repurchasing this cleanser over and over again. After washing my skin feels comfortable. Not too dry and yet have that clean feeling. The smell is soothing too.
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Singapore,its an old stock,products looks like an old stock/fake as its watery rather than more solid form
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Same result as other cleanser,Smell good and clean well. The price is actually acceptable. Texture is good too. But to be honest it has no difference from other cleanser. Repurchase? Maybe not. Maybe yes. 
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Comfortable to use,"This is a very good but basic cleansing foam. It leaves the skin feeling refreshed but not tight. There is also no overpowering scent. A little goes a long way, so I believe the product will last me for some time. "
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Okay product,Not suitable for my combination and sensitive skin. The product is very foamy when lathered with water. My skin will be in “squicky” clean feeling and dry after use. 
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Big fan of this cleaner. ,"It is a thick foaming cleanser. About the size of a mung bean is enough. Takes 8 to 12 months to finish 1 bottle. This is my 5th bottle, if not wrong. No strong fragrance. Less acne if I wash my face twice a day. But now I stay at home didn’t makeup so I only wash my face with it before going to sleep. In the morning I only use fresh water to wash my face. My skin type is between combination and dry. "
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Satisfy,I so happy with Lancome Facial Cleanser. It suits me well. I have combination oily skin. I'm using it for a week already I see the positive effects. My skin not oily anymore plus I can feel that my skin really smooth and clean. 
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,love it ,"I love foamy face cleanser, and this one is the most foamy I ever tried. You need sooo little to get so much foam. Love the results after face wash, it feels super fresh and clean, without any tension. "

LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Australia,Best cleanser I've ever used.,I tried this product as a sample and now won't use anything else!
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Philippines,Lancome Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,"The Lancome Gel eclat clarifying facial cleanser does not dry my skin at all. I usually use a very small amount but it produces a great lather that is really fine, smooth and voluminous that it easily glides on my face - it truly feels so luxurious on the skin. In addition to that, this product smells really nice plus it easily removes makeup and impurities in a gentle way."
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Squeaky clean feeling,Great for oily / oily combination skin. Have that squeaky clean feeling every time after wash. A little squeeze of product goes a long way. May not be suitable for dry skin.
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Really good,This cleanser really good. Smells nice and i love it. It does work on my skin (combination skin). Just use little squeeze and the foams incredible. For my using it will take  long time to finish this cleanser. It’s worth for me
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Best face cleanser for combi skin ,"Been using this for years, I have combination skin which means I need a cleanser which effectively removes oil and cleans pores, and yet not too drying on my skin. This works perfectly, I’ve tried other brands but this is still the best for combi skin in a hot and humid weather. "
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,great for combination skin,smells nice. cleans extremely well. i have dry to normal skin. it does leave my skin taut after cleansing eventhough i used a pea sized amount of gel. however my skin seems to absorb my serum and moisturiser better everytime after i cleanse my face
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,,really comfortable to skin,"i’m have an oily combination skin and this facial cleanser is really comfortable on my skin. It foams up a lot and takes away the dirt from my skin but gentle at the same time. i really love the scent of this product too, will definitely buy this product again."
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,Australia,Really good results,Bought this previously and decided to buy for daughters Extremely happy with product and small amount used for great cleanse

LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,,very good,"
I bought it at a 20% discount. Discounts are very cost-effective. Sephora shopping is very convenient. I am now a gold card.

I bought it at a 20% discount. Discounts are very cost-effective. Sephora shopping is very convenient. I am now a gold card."
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,,Good,"I have been using this since January and I love how it does not strip away my moisture but cleans the impurities very well. It is actually a basic cleanser for normal to sensitive skin. If you are on a budget, better buy something cheaper coz this does not really give any extraordinary results. Just a normal cleaner but lived up to the descriptions. "
LANCÔME-Gel Eclat Clarifying Facial Cleanser,,my favourite!,This is a great face wash especially for people with combination / oily skin. I'm on my 3rd tube now and do not intend to change to any other face wash. The smell is very fresh and nice and leave you feeling very clean. Would definitely recommend!
SHISEIDO-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Favorite cleanser,A bit of the foam already ensures a good cleanse. My favorite as it gives me a squeaky clean feel (I have oily to combi skin).
SHISEIDO-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Singapore,A little bit goes a long way!,Rich foaming cleanser. Only need a tiny amount for the whole face. Skin does not feel tight or dry after wash. Absolutely gentle. Good value for a quality product. Love it!
SHISEIDO-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Australia,Mr,Great cleanser that is not too drying.
SHISEIDO-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Love this cleanser,"Second time repurchase, and I can say that this product is so good. I’m so in love with this and I definitely will repurchase it when I finish my product"

SHISEIDO-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Loving it !,Loving the texture of the product and my face doesn't feel dry after cleansing and yet my face feel very clean after each use.  Will definitely buy again.
SHISEIDO-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,Singapore,-,"I didn’t find that it did anything amazing for my skin when i used this, but it did clean quite well and i finished the whole bottle, i probably wouldnt repurchase "
SHISEIDO-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,,very good!!,"Very good cleansing foam, does not make my skin dry or tight after wash. Like it’s texture very much, creamy and moisture. Hope Sephora can sell more Shiseido products like Eudermine and Bio Performance LiftDynamic Cream."
SHISEIDO-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,,Good cleanser but a bit drying,"A good facial cleanser, it can remove light make-up, face feels squeaky clean and soft after use. it can be a bit drying but the normal basic 3 steps routine (clean, tone, moisturize) will resolve the dryness. It is best used with Shiseido lotion and moisturizer of the same range."
SHISEIDO-Clarifying Cleansing Foam,,second purchase ,"I first purchased this last yr and it lasts till 2019, 6-7 months for me. After using this, no breakout or acne problem anymore, not even pimples. It may be a little bit pricey but it worth the price and really works on me. Highly recommended.!"
SHISEIDO-Deep Cleansing Foam,Singapore,love it,I've been using this product for many years.
SHISEIDO-Deep Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Deep cleaning foam ,"I have been using Shiseido products for 
several years, and I must use them every day to wash my face, especially for oily skin.  This cleanser is very useful for my oily skin."
SHISEIDO-Deep Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Love Shiseido Cleanser,"Love Shiseido’s Cleanser especially the White Luscent Brightening, sadly it was out of stock for quite sometimes, had to get this instead to replenish my cleanser. Been trying out different brand’s cleanser but still prefer Shiseido’s as it makes skin throughly cleansed and fresh. other cleanser usually doesn’t fully cleanse some of there are still oil residue on my face especially around the nose, but for this I really love how it feels after wash. I love to pair it with Foreo’s Luna Play Cleansing device as it complement and makes the cleanser works even better. "
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Milk Oil Cleanser,Philippines,Good Buy,"It feels nice on skin and it moisturize my skin and a great oil cleanser for those dealing with damaged skin barrier. As for the price it's a bit more expensive than basic cleansing milk, but it's a bit different too. Can definitely find a cheaper alternative. "
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Milk Oil Cleanser,Singapore,new staple for my routine,"i had heard mixed reviews about it so i wasn't sure if i should get it because i'm one of those people who love cleansing oils more than balms but then i decided to just go ahead and try it because everyone's skin is different and so far, mine has reacted quite well to it. even though they say you can skip the double cleansing step, i still do it just to make sure all the spf and dirt is off my face before bed"
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Milk Oil Cleanser,Singapore,Light weight but gets the job done,"This is my second purchase of the Milk Oil Cleanser after trying out the try out kits and I'm likely to keep getting the same one in the future! Sometimes, my skin reacts badly with cleansers that that are too strong or breaks out easily especially during the time-of-the-month. But since using this Cleanser, the breakouts are minimal and clears up quite quickly.. I must say its definitely worth trying. "
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Milk Oil Cleanser,Singapore,Cleanser,Love how soft the texture of the cleanser. Removes base makeup well. 
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Milk Oil Cleanser,Singapore,Feeling moisture on face ,"My first time try this milk oil cleanser.Laneige product suits me well. Price is reasonable.
I will buy more skincare from Laneige.
Good product and suits my skin.

"
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Milk Oil Cleanser,Singapore,So so,"It's a great gentle cleanser for the morning, but I wouldn't use it as an oil cleanser as it's almost too thick.
I think people with dry skin would like it better! Also, smells like glue."
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Milk Oil Cleanser,Singapore,nice cleanser,"Second buy for this milk cleanser, have been using this every night for my first cleanse to remove sunscreen, and morning for a gentle wash. The texture is more runny compare to other milk cleanser but it’s with oil so it removed light makeup efficiently as well. No scent too."
THREE-Balancing Cleansing Oil R,Singapore,Does the job,"Have been using this product for over a month. It’s not drying for my combination-sensitive skin. It doesn’t irritate my hypersensitive hormonal skin. I’m using this as part of double cleanse routine. It’s not too oily either. Doesn’t need to use a huge amount to clean entire face, just 2 pumps should suffice. "
THREE-Balancing Cleansing Oil R,Singapore,Good oil remover,"Non sticky, lovely to use remover. Very light and does its job with very little. it's a bit of a splurge in my opinion but a little goes a long way, so it's quite worth it. "
THREE-Balancing Cleansing Oil R,Singapore,Balancing cleansing oil,"Love this Japanese brand, is so moisturising after using this oil my skin felt super hydrated and clean, very light weight and the smell is mild and highly recommend."
THREE-Balancing Cleansing Oil R,Singapore,hands down the best ,"Cleans off well and you do not need to use cotton pads which is a many pluses for me! Skin is very moisture and smooth after each wash. The citrus scent is also a plus! Love this, after using this I never went back to bioderma miscellar which is what I have been using prior to this"
DRGL-Cleanser Sensitive,Singapore,not bad ,"Item is in liquid form and light & beige In Color. Not sure if it’s supposed to be like that in Color. Again the pump has a safety position to press down, which is good. But it’s hard to find the right spot to pump. Not drying so it’s much better than my previous. Can buy again"
DRGL-Cleanser Sensitive,Singapore,DRGL cleanser sensitive ,I have been using this since 2019. A gentle cleanser which effectively cleans my face twice daily. Doesn’t dry my face. A bit pricey but the quality is there. 
DRGL-Cleanser Sensitive,Singapore,Love it! ,"Great product! Would recommend it to others. Doesn't make the skin dry, effective. Feel really ""clean"" in the skin after usage. I will recommend it to my friend and family :) you should try too"
DRGL-Cleanser Sensitive,Singapore,Cleanser Sensitive ,An absolute fan of this cleanser. Non foaming and non drying. Gentle for sensitive skin. So good I could use it everyday without feeling any dryness of the skin. 
DRGL-Cleanser Sensitive,Singapore,PRICEY,Cleanser Sensitive  DRGL products are expensive but the quality is there. The consistency of this cleanser is creamy and which I personally don't prefer as it does not make my skin feels clean. 
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Australia,great cleansing oil ,"Gently removes makeup, doesn’t sting eyes and all around a great cleansing product. Great product! Will be purchasing again and recommending this to my friends and family "
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Australia,not too oily leaving skin refresh,does the job of removing stubborn make up and clearing your face free of dirt. however you still need to use a proper cleanser to wash your face after use of this product. 
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,I love this,"I’ve tried a lot of cleansing oils in the market but I keep coming back to this one. I love how thick and rich it is, you can really feel the quality of the oil as you massage it into your skin. After rinsing it off, my skin always feels so moisturized and healthy, I can notice a difference when I don’t use this. Along with the soy face cleanser and the kombucha facial treatment essence my skin has never looked better. Dare I say, radiant! I truly believe this is worth the money! My ONLY gripe with this though is that the packaging sucks and the bottle will leak oil somehow and it’s a little frustrating because it’s messy/wasteful. Fresh, PLEASE fix the packaging I want to keep repurchasing!!!!"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Canada,Glowing skin!,"I bought this as a light cleanser for no make up days but it works for make up removal too. I use two pumps on my dry no make up face, three pumps of I have make up on, and let it sink in for a minute. I then lathered it up with a little water and rinse off. I’ve never had such a moisturizing cleaner make my skin glow so nice. It was great over the winter and so far it doesn’t make my skin any oilier in the summer. I highly recommend this cleanser!!!"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Australia,great,Enjoying this product however it is still unclear how much to use and whether or not adding water is beneficial. At the moment I use 3 pumps and I’m going through it quick but it doesn’t lend it self to covering large spaces unfortunately. Very hydrating and smells great! 
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Australia,Good at removing makeup but not the best,"It does a decent job at removing make up and leaves the skin not feeling dry or stripped. However, I find some cleansing balms better at removing the makeup as this takes a while and sometimes two goes to fully remove my water-proof mascara. "
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Singapore,favourite cleansing oil right now ,"Very particular about cleansing oil and I have oily/combi skin. It is very hard to come by something that cleans well without feeling oily, and I’m sticking to Fresh because my skin feels good with it. "
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,FRESH Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,"Pretty nice. Has an earthy smell and works to quickly remove makeup. It also doesn’t irritate my eyes. A little goes a long way, which is good as it’s a touch pricey."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Melts makeup - even eye - gently and completely,Love everything about this product - Melts makeup - even eye - gently and completely. Love the scent and that it's good for my skin.
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,displeasing cleanser,"I'm not sure what is happening exactly but there is a pile of cleanser after every use. super messy. I have to wipe my counter every time. the oil does an OK job but not the best. it doesn't easily remove liquid eyeliner. it is hydrating, I'll say that. I wouldn't buy this again due to the messy product packaging and it doesn't melt my eyeliner. it doesn't feel like it's drawing out any sebum as well..."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,This cleanser saved my skin!,"Skin changes. You will no doubt find that what once worked wonders in your skincare routine, just doesn’t cut it anymore. Seaberry Skin Nutrition 
Cleansing Oil gave me my skin back. I was struggling with redness and combination dry patches and oily skin. It was horrible. I was glad to be able to hide behind my daily required surgical mask. Once I tried this cleanser, the irritated red breakouts on my cheeks calmed and dry patches seemed smoother. Give this a try if you’re struggling with aging changing skin that’s not responding well to anything.
Have to mention my fave moisturizer, Lotus Youth Preserve is amazing too."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,"Love the product, hate the bottle",This works well to remove makeup and sunscreen and doesn’t cause breakouts. The bottle or the seal on the top or something is not good. It leaks somehow. I thought maybe the first bottle might have been the issue but now the second bottle has the same problem. I store this upright and don’t shake it or anything but just tilting it when I grab or pump the top causes some product to leak. I won’t buy it again unless I can’t find a suitable replacement product.
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Canada,FRESH Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,"I’m on my 5th bottle, have been using it for years. I’ve tried many, many other cleansers and cleansing oils and nothing compares. I wish it was more affordable but it’s just incomparable to anything else on the market. It removes ALL makeup with just 2 pumps and leaves skin so soft. I follow up with a serum and a moisturizer. I don’t know how it’s not more popular!"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Australia,favourite make up remover,"Love this product! such a quick and effective way to remove make up and due to it being an oil base cleanser, it doesn't leave the skin feeling super dry and stripped like other cleansers."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Australia,Silky Feel,"Used a few days ago, so nice & gentle on skin with no irritation on my face or my eyes. I’ve only trialed this removing sunscreen, so I can’t comment on makeup. Since Covid lockdown I have no use for makeup, but I’m assuming if it’s removed my sunscreen then it should remove makeup. That testing is a for another day hopefully. Only issue I have is the pump it’s not that smooth I hoped it would be. But product is by far the best oil remover I’ve  tried for first cleanse!"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Australia,"Beautiful oil, cleanses exceptionally well ","I’ve used the Go-To cleansing oil and much prefer this one. I find this removes makeup better, emulsifies well and 2 pumps is plenty for the whole face. "
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Amazed - Replacing My Cerave Hydrating Cleanser,"I have been using Cerave hydrating cleanser, along with their AM/PM lotions since I can remember. My skin is fine in terms of acne and pretty much breaks out due to normal changes every month or if I don’t drink enough water, so it has been “manageable”. However my skin also generally feels dried out but so so oily! After simply deciding enough was enough, I decided to change things up hoping for a difference. Got this oil cleanser, Keihls 24hr everyday facial lotion, and the Murad hydrating SPF. I love the way this cleanser feels after using it. I don’t do a double cleanse (I don’t wear much make up, so use it to really take the day off, and I feel it does).  It leaves my skin feeling clean but not tight or red. I didn’t know an oil could make my face feel so refreshed! Coupled with the Keihls lotion (tiny bit in the morning, and a little more coverage at night) my skin feels so good! No immediate break outs. Slightly less oily off the bat, but only time will tell if it makes any more substantial change. If you are looking to rip the bandaid off your normal cleanser, like the recommended Cerave, this was a great entry point for me."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Singapore,great cleansing oil,"Great cleaning oil even for waterproof mascara.
Work well on dry skin.                                              

                  
                     
 "
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,FRESH Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Makes my skin clean and not dry. Doesn’t smell like much of anything.
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,not my favorite,Didn’t love this. It didn’t seem to easily break down my spf and rinse clean. Prefer amorepacific cleaning oil.
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Australia,boring and smells like a grandmas product,"Didn’t take my make up off well, was basically just like an oil that shifted everything around, my face didn’t feel clean at all after using this and I would still end up with make up residue on my cotton wipe from my toner AFTER showering off the  cleanser. Plus it smelt like a product my 85 year old grandma would use. "
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Canada,Does it’s job well!,"I’ve been on the hunt for a good cleansing oil and have tried many, but this one is definitely my favourite so far! I much prefer the pump to scooping product out of a jar. I usually find myself using 2-3 pumps for my skin and then 1-2 pumps for my eyes, depending on how much makeup I’m wearing. Most of the time I’ll need a face cloth to finish off my mascara - no biggie. 

I use this as step one in my double cleanse routine, before the Soy Face Cleanser (also by Fresh) and the duo is killer. My skin is always so soft afterwards!"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Canada,Doesn't Remove Waterproof Mascara,Doesn't remove Tarte Lights Camera Splashes. I had to use my cleansing balm to remove. Shu Umera cleansing oil works much better.
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Singapore,does the job but so so ,The oil does the job- it cleans off the makeup. However I really can’t say I enjoy the 2 minutes as the smell is not pleasant. It’s a personal thing as some people would argue the smell indicates the no additive was added (and I believe so). But for the price think we can get something satisfy the customer from all angles 
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,FRESH Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,This is make up remover is amazing! Works well and smells lovely.
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Must buy if you love your skin,Great for daily cleansing in a double cleanser routine and the best for makeup removal. I don’t even buy wipes anymore this beyond does the job and leaves skin so nourished.
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Singapore,clean and fresh,Have always love an oil cleanser for double cleansing especially after a heavy make up day. It effortless clean my make up and oil on my face before my 2nd cleanse! Definitely a good buy. 
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Almost Perfect,"Decided to try this oil cleanser but I feel like its using more product than necessary. I use 3-4 pumps which made me go through the bottle more quickly compared to the Farmacy makeup balm cleanser (which would last me a few months and is cheaper). It's also a bummer because the pump leaks out product from the neck of the bottle which wastes product. Not entirely sure if I will purchase again. It does remove my makeup really well and I follow it up with a foam cleanser.  It just doesn't feel like I'm getting all the bang with my buck, hence the 4 stars."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Canada,Hydrating & Gentle,"This is an incredibly hydrating cleanser with a luxurious feel. Lately it's been my go-to first cleanse, which I follow up with a foamy cleanser such as the Youth To The People cleanser. 

It takes off makeup, including stubborn mascara and eyeliner. I love the smell - light and spa like - and reach for this when my skin is feeling dry or I want to 'massage' and take my time cleansing. 

I don't know how this would hold up as a sole cleanser i.e. I've never used it without following with a second cleanse. Seems like it would leave a little film of oil left behind if you didn't second cleanse. 

Overall, 4/5 stars. Would repurchase."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Australia,Exceeded my expectations!,"This was something I bought on a whim. Having never tried an oil based cleanser before, I wasn’t really sure what to expect but after 6 months of use, it has become one of my holy grail products. I love how it doesn’t leave my skin dry and you only need a small amount to remove makeup and sunscreen. The fragrance is a little strong but not overbearing. I recommend massaging the product into your skin dry before adding a small amount of water to emulsify it. Definitely a product I will be purchasing again. Highly recommend!"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Canada,FRESH Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,"Smells amazing, removes makeup efficiently and comfortably and doesn't dry my skin out. Half way through the bottle and am happy with this purchase to the point I plan on purchasing again."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,"Meh, I’ve had better...","This is very gentile, but not very effective. I wear very little makeup and this does not remove it. As a result, I only use this in the morning. There are much better oil cleansers that are just as gentile and more effective. Will not buy again."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,FRESH Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,"I fell into purchasing this item due to some “hype” and recommendations. Definitely not a “love”. I feel like I have to use this product two or three times in a row just to remove my eye makeup - and I usually have mascara remnants. There are better makeup removers/cleansing oils out there. On a positive note, this product did not aggravate my combo acne prone skin."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Not for sensitive skin,This was very disappointing. All I read was promising for my sensitive skin but definitely this dries up my skin.
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,FRESH Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,"I love Fresh and have given this a chance for 2 week... unfortunately my skin is looking so bad. I have horrible texture all over my face... forehead, cheeks, chin and jaw. This is the only new product I’ve added to my routine so I have to blame it. Really wanted to love it but I have to return :("
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,10/10,"I know it’s cliche, but I never review anything unless I believe and actually use the product for some time. Anyways! This is by far the best cleansing oil ever! I have dry skin for quite sometime now and it honestly removes my makeup completely & it also leaves my face feeling soft AF even before moisturizing which is amazing! Definitely recommend to all the dry skin babies out there! Will buy again. It pairs good with Fresh Rose deep hydration face cream."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Canada,FRESH Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,For eye makeup you do need a few pumps. Overall it gets makeup off and is very gentle. I have dry skin and it’s been fine for me.
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,FRESH Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,"Great product! This thoroughly removes my makeup, including waterproof, and leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed. I use this as my first cleanser in my nightly double cleanse and as my only cleanser in the am. The only reason I took a star away was the price point is rather high."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Canada,Best cleanser/makeup remover,"Just love this.  I spread it and massage it all around, then wet my hands a bit and make it foam and massage some more, then  rinse.   Takes everything off including most of my mascara, and does not strip my super sensitive, rosacea- prone, mid-50s skin.  Wsh I had discovered this before. No need for another cleanser."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Expensive but worth it,"I compare every cleansing oil I try, because I like trying what's new, to this one. It's simple, the fragrance isn't overwhelming, and it really removes most of my makeup for the first part of my double cleanse. It also doesn't burn my eyes which a lot of them do. I often rationalize the price (because daass expensive) as it does last me a good while and I try to buy it during a sale."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Australia,good for skin,ohh my god this is what i always looking for . thos is my oil based makeup cleanser . it melts my makeup so easily and i straight way washed it first. cleanse most of the makeup .
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,The BEST cleansing oil,"As someone who has tried all the popular cleansing oils, this is BY FAR the best and most effective. I have repurchased this twice. I’ll be honest- the packaging leaks, it’s a pain to travel with. Yes, I’ve closed the top. Yes, both bottles did the same thing. I get past it because this is the best oil for scrubbing away all the stuff you don’t want on your skin. My skin is very sensitive and this never strips it, just leaves it clean and hydrated. It’s not heavy, no intense fragrance. It’s my favorite part of my skin care routine. I can’t recommend it enough!"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Australia,Best oil cleanser so far,"Sephora keeps running out of stock of this cuz this is such a outstanding product. It removes your makeup and dirt without drying your skin. And after your wash it out, your skin feels so so soft and supple. After my two-year of using it, it never causes me any break outs. No need to double cleanse if you have makeups on your face but need extra eyes and lips remover if you have heavy eye eyeliner and lipstick. Do spend time on massaging your skin and emulsifying."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Smells great ,Just started double cleansing routine - this smells great and does the job. Easy to use and didnt give me a break out                                 
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,new favorite,"My skin is dryer than it used to be, and my usual cetaphil cleaner wasn’t cutting it anymore. I’ve been using this for almost a year now, and my skin feels soft, clean, and it smells great! I will never buy anything else."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,United Kingdom,Magic in a bottle!,"Just purchased my third bottle! This is my favorite cleaning oil ever after using many different brands and products of cleansing oils and balms. This is great for acne prone skin yet it is very rich and moisturising. Removes all makeup effortlessly, washes off easily with just water and over time had a brightening effect on my dark spots. I follow this cleanse with the soy face cleanser at night for the perfect cleansing routine. Couldn’t recommend this enough!"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,United Kingdom,"Nice product, poor packaging","Bought the product 2 months ago and really liked it but the oil is leaking out of the pump, even being kept upright on a surface- I have to throw it away. Very disappointing for an expensive product."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Repurchased it,"A little on the pricey side, but does its job well. Cleans off makeup without making your face feel dry. I repurchased this after I was done with my first bottle."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Simple and effective.,"I’ve been using this for about a month or so now and I got to say, I’m going to repurchase it. It’s simple and not irritating and leaves your skin feeling smooth and not stripped away after removing my makeup. I have dry, sensitive , acne prone skin and I haven’t experienced any new breakouts or anything of the sort with using this. I’m happy to have this in my double cleanse routine at night!"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,A Must-Have,"As I have aged my sensitive skin has gotten dryer, but also started breaking out with clogged pores.  During a facial I was told to look into cleansing oils.  I was skeptical because it is tough for me to find cleansers that actually do a good job of thoroughly removing cosmetics.  I even tried a Clarisonic for a while before I realized it was hurting my sensitive skin and really not getting all the make-up off.  I can tell you that this stuff works!  Not only is my skin glowing, but it completely cleans while keeping your skin soft.  And I have absolutely no acne.  My skin is calm, and youthful.  I'm shocked a little goes a long way-I still have plenty of my first bottle left (buying my second one now to have on hand).  A couple of pumps-that's it.  I absolutely love this product and cannot recommend enough.  I should mention my dermatologist gave me samples of a Neutrogena wash which I have been using this past week to get rid of.  Guess what?  Back to dry, irritated skin and break outs.  I am tossing the samples and going back to my cleansing oil.  It really works!"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Australia,Mr,"It works pretty good. I don’t have dryness after wash my face, but I could get similar traits from product that is cheaper. I might not get it again, also because it is not convenient to bring for travel. "
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,irritating and greasy,"I broke out terribly around my chin, mouth, on my cheeks and really honestly just everything below my eyes down to my chin. Broke out in spots that are never irritated. My skin was also left very oily and greasy. Do not recommend."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Favorite Oil Cleanser,I really love this cleanser. Perfect first step of my routine. It is so luxurious and truly removes all of my makeup including heavy eye makeup. I keep trying to switch to a cheaper oil cleanser but every other one doesn't cleanse as well as this one.
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,The best cleansing oil,"I used this seaberry cleansing oil as first step in double cleansing routine,and it doesnt dried up my skin or cause any breakouts. My skin does feels clean and soft after use and i like it so much! Oh my skin is combination type anyway"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Australia,Cleansing oil,"I was really excited to receive this product because of the great reviews. And the thing is, I’m not dissatisfied per se, but I don’t think it’s worth 43 dollars. I’ve been using avocado oil ($7) to remove my make up and moisturize. It’s generally used as a carrier oil, but oil is oil, and I wash it off in the shower. I was comparing this product the first night, and it requires MORE Than when I use avocado oil and doesn’t work quite as well as plain old avocado oil I got from the skincare department of an organic grocery store. I also noticed the first ingredient of this cleanser is grape seed oil.i know it’s a carrier oil, BUT I doubt there’s enough of the “seaberry” oil, etc to justify the the high price."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,"Great product, packaging could be better",Recently purchased my second bottle of this stuff. Works very well and doesn't leave a greasy feeling on my skin afterwards. Removes my waterproof mascara and doesn't sting my eyes. Fragrance is a little off-putting at first but I got used to it and it doesn't bother me anymore. Only downside is product leaking from the top with every pump and making a mess on my counter.
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,leaves face feeling fresh,Love the smell of the product and the ease of use. I wouldn’t say it changed my skin but it definitely does not make it worse. Feels gentle to the face and love the cleaning effect. Nice to use. 
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Great but pretty pricey,"Taking half a star off just because it costs so much! It's great at removing make up but my Bobbi Brown or even Shu Uemura works the same. However of course, being a Fresh product, it has that luxurious feeling when applying on my face. I personally would not repurchase unless it goes on sale. "
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,FRESH Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,"Love the product, HATE the bottle. I’ve had it for awhile, but know it would last even longer if it didn’t leak. Would never consider traveling with this bottle either for that reason. Please fix the bottle and I will repurchase."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,"Lightweight, great fresh scent oil","Took a little getting used to, using this as my nightly face wash. Since it doesn’t lather like soap was different at first. Product really removes makeup, leaves my skin feeling hydrated.. not tight and dry like most do. The scent I really love to, very fresh. Have been using for a few weeks, no breakouts or problems at all."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Effective lightweight cleansing oil,"Sometimes you can’t give into the bad reviews and just try the product out yourself. I absolutely love this oil to melt away my makeup and mascara. It’s very lightweight so you may think the 3-4 pumps recommended won’t work but it truly does!

Take your time with the product, don’t be afraid to rub it into your skin and allow it to melt your makeup! It also leaves my skin super soft even after using my regular cleanser and Foreo."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Great cleansing oil,I have combination/ oily skin and can easily breakout to products. this cleansing oil did not make me break out. My face feels clean and soft. I love this stuff.
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Singapore,I quite like this ,"The item has a mild scent, fruity, and quite thick in texture. Cleans the skin well, remember to massage it on your skin for at least 60 seconds before adding water. You will see wonderful result as dead skin is melting away "
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Canada,FRESH Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Love love love. Smells amazing and feels amazing. I liked this for getting makeup residue off.
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Australia,Decent oil cleanser,"I decided to dabble into the realm of double cleansing with an oil cleanser, and this one does a reasonable job of removing off most make up without leaving the skin feeling greasy, however definitely still need to go in for a second cleanse to get rid of the residual eye make up. Doesn't irritate my eyes which is a bonus!"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Canada,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"I am absolutely inlove with this product. I loved it so much I bought a bottle and had it shipped to my best friends house so she could fall inlove too (she did). Smells amazing, cost of the product is justified by the size of the bottle and how little you have to use. Honestly, my skin has NEVER been better. Never ever. I have tried every single cleanser you could think of, I have sensitive skin - can’t be too exploiting but has to clean etc etc. I thought I loved my Clinique cleanser until I tried this and now I will never buy any other cleanser. Highly recommend using with Sephora’s cleansing pad also. Just a great mix."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Great!,I think this is a great cleansing oil. Easily removes all makeup without leaving the face dry. The smell can be strong at first but I find it goes away quick. It's very easy to rinse off before you use your main cleanser too. I only need to use two pumps (I don't wear a lot of make up). Its not too bad of a price compared to others but I do prefer a cheeper one since I don't wear a full face of makeup.
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,First Cleansing Oil,"I am about to finish my first full size bottle of this cleansing oil and let me just say I am shook! I am so happy I was introduced to this product as it removes my waterproof mascara so easily without me having to be so rough on my eyes. I double cleanse and I am so happy with this product as no face wash would be able to remove all the makeup without first going in with an oil cleanser and then my regular face wash. If you are shopping around for a great first cleanser that will work without being harsh on your skin, this is it. Completely recommend."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Australia,Best oil cleanser ,"I've tried a lot of oil cleansers and this is by far the best. Its just a smidge on the pricey side but its really worth the $$. I use about 2-3 pumps everyday as my first cleanser and it works wonders removing every bit of makeup and sunscreen without drying out my skin. Also bonus point, this is the only oil cleanser I've ever tried that doesn't burn when I use it to remove my eye makeup. "
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Light and Clean,The formulae for this product is light and it cleans/removes make up too! I really love the texture as it is not too strong for my sensitive skin! Highly recommended to sensitive and oily skin! 
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,best cleanser for sensitive skin!!!,"Skin type: highly sensitive acne prone 
1.5 week update: Wowzers!! 
I have searched years for a cleanser that is gentle on the skin, natural, would not break me out. I have tried countless brands and products including: Estée Lauder, skii, youth to the people, farmacy, Boscia, Kate Somerville, first aid beauty, Clinique, drunk elephant, amore pacific, la roche, cerave, etc.. everything either did not improve my skin, or irritated my skin, or broke me out. After reading all the reviews, I finally decided to try this oil cleanser. It took a few days for my skin to adjust. I developed a few small red bumps on my chin and nose, but not severe. I continued to use because my skin texture felt better, very hydrated and soft. After a few days the bumps disappeared and my skin is left looking smooth and supple. Hardly any spots. My complexion is so much better already. I use this cleanser in the morning to cleanse, and at night to cleanse and take off makeup. Two times per day everyday. It is a versatile product. I massage it into the skin for a while then rinse with lukewarm water. I cannot recommend this product enough!! If you are super sensitive & acne prone, definitely give it a try. I will continue to purchase!"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,FRESH Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,I use this for taking off makeup when I'm already in the shower. Maybe I'm not using it long enough on my eyes but it doesn't take everything off completely and double cleanse. I usually have to follow with vaseline or micelle water to completely take off my eyemake up and I only usually use eyeliner and mascara.
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,New Zealand,silky smooth,Broke out in little white heads first use. But it’s okay now. Cleanses makeup off really well. Love how it’s not greasy and absorbs nicely into skin. Leaves face feeling super soft. 
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Singapore,good stuff for your skin,"skin is soft like a baby after used and all kind of make up water proof, lips, eyes whatever.... is wiped off like a breeze. love this. repurchased and will keep repurchasing "
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Great Oil Cleanser,This is an all around good oil cleanser. I’ve recommended it to multiple people and they’ve all liked it. It gets all my makeup off and emulsified well without leaving a residue after washing it off. It also helped my skin as I find that my skin overall looks a little brighter. My only complaint is that there’s no need to add a fragrance to this as that can irritate others with sensitive skin. Would definitely repurchase if I didn’t already have another oil cleanser I wanna try out next
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Beautiful Product,"This oil is so easy to use. It has a light woody/berry scent which makes experience rather therapeutic. The consistency is not to thick and not too runny. It removes most of my make up (I go full on application with a lot bronzer, blush, eyeshadow, etc.). Though it cannot entirely remove my waterproof mascara; some flakes are still seen on my lashes, but that’s understandable as mascara is one the hardest makeup to get rid of. This oil leaves the skin really soft and supple, not drying at all for my combi skin. Worth every penny though I think I’ll burn through the bottle in less than a month! "
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,FRESH Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,"I was looking for an oil-based cleanser for winter and I found this product. I liked that you can pump the oil and rub it over your face to melt any products from the day and then use water, which turns the oil into a milky consistency. It leave the face feeling clean but not dry which is perfect for winter. My only problem is with the packaging. I've already returned it once thinking that I had a defective item, but the oil leaks out from the base of the cap. The 2nd time around leaked less."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,,good cleanser,"Abit expensive but worth it....the smell is good...
it really cleans the skin very well n it also remove all the dirts include blackheads n whiteheads "
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Canada,FRESH Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,The best product to remove your makeup gently! I tried a lot of different oils and balms and they always burn my eyes so much and this product never does. Overall great
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,,cleanser fave,Yes i purchased this last year August 2019 and I have not finisher this bottle yet. If you are looking for oil cleanser that will trullu cleanse your face from your everyday make up this is the right one! I have just purchased another bottle so i wont run of it. Thank you Fresh!!!!’ Love it so much..
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Takes off EVERYTHING,"I love this cleansing oil. I am on my second bottle of it. I use 2 pumps each night. It removes all of my makeup including mascara, without irritating my skin or eyes"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Canada,"Love the product, not the bottle.","Love this product, but the bottle needs a redsigns. Out of 6 bottles I've purchased, 4 leak when pumed from under the silver pump screw cap. And it's really messy to take back. Requires an extra thread in my opinion."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Canada,The only makeup remover doesn’t break me out!,"A little pricey, but It only takes two or three pumps to remove a cake face, a bottle can last for a long time!!! Doesn’t leave any greasy residue, best makeup remover ever period."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Make a travel-friendly size!,"This product is AMAZING! It removed all makeup without irritating my skin/eyes. It is gentle but removes even ""long-wearing"" eye makeup. I've tried similar products and this is the best for me and my sensitive skin. My only suggestion is that Fresh make a travel size!!"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,SMOOTHNESS GALORE,I love this. It's the best at breaking up waterproof makeup and sunblock! It's very thin and you will need to mix with a bit of water to activate the spread of it. I will definitely be buying this again!
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,Canada,"Irritating for sensitive, dry skin","I bought this yesterday with the understanding that it would be great for my sensitive, dry skin. However, after only using it for 2 days, I already know it has to go right back to the store. After washing with it last night, my face became quite irritated and dry. I had to rewash with Cerave Hydrating cleanser to calm my skin down. I thought maybe it was just a fluke and decided to try again today. Same thing happened, only tonight the irritation was worse and my face felt quite itchy. I had high hopes for this product (it has a great list of ingredients) and am disappointed it didn't work out for me."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,FRESH Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,"I have very acne-prone skin. After starting to use a Retin-A for my acne, my face dried out like crazy, and makeup remover wipes only exacerbated the problem. This cleansing oil has totally saved me. It removes almost ALL of my makeup while keeping my skin hydrated. And it doesn't break me out! The only problem I've been having is that I have a hard time removing all of my mascara with this. However, I've been too pleased with the overall effect of this product to get too fussed about that small detail."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,AWESOME,This is perfect for removing makeup as a first cleanse! it fully removes all my eye makeup without stinging my eyes. it really does such a great job I could use this alone without a second cleanser.
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Works beautifully,"I've been using the oil cleansing method for years but initially got this for traveling and ease of packing.  I love that you can twist it closed securely.  It smells lovely and removes my makeup completely leaving my skin soft and smooth and never overly stripped or dry.  I have combination, sensitive , acne prone skin and was told from a young age to avoid all products containing oil.  That was very bad advice and I wish I would have know in my teen years the importance of nurturing and not over stripping my skin!  I love this cleansing oil!"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Great makeup remover,Great makeup remover. Doesn’t leave me feeling greasy but does make my skin feel hydrated after using
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Great for double cleansing.,"This is step one in my double cleansing process. I have been using it for about two weeks now. I bought it as I was in the market for something to take off my full face makeup, especially the stubborn mascara. I sampled it along with a couple other products (too faced melt off and boscia make up break up) before ultimately deciding on this product. Although it seems like a big investment due to the price, it’s totally worth it since I am using less makeup removing wipes now which were very irritating for my skin. Per the directions, I only use a few tiny pumps of product each use and that’s enough to get the job done. Leaves skin makeup free and feeling super soft."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Fave Oil Cleanser,"I don't usually wear a full face of makeup, my every day makeup usually consists of mascara and soap brows. However, I still like to do a double cleanse as I feel like it helps to break up surface debris and prep my skin for water-based cleansers. It has a really pleasant rosemary-ish scent and I like that the ingredients are mostly clean and simple. After trying other oil cleansers and balms at various prices and this one is definitely my favorite in terms of value and quality!"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Gentle but effective cleanse,"I just got this during the VIB Rouge sale and so far I am loving it. I wear very heavy eye make up. Lots of liner, mascara, and eye shadow from everyday to bright vivid colors so a great cleanser is important. I have been on the hunt to find something that will get it all off without a lot of scrubbing, rubbing and tugging on the gentle skin around the eye area. Apply it to a dry face and gently rub it around and over the eyes and watch everything break up and slide off! then go in and scrub and wash your face as normal and rinse clean. It doesn't feel stripping or drying, I also didn't notice any residue. It's a happy purchase for me!"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,BUY!,"This stuff is amazing!! I have horrible enlarged pores, I get monthly facials but not much you can do for pores. I've been hearing the hype on ""double cleansing"" but thought it was pointless. I finally decided to buy this Seaberry oil cleanser and use it with the soy face cleanser, most of my skin routine contains Fresh cosmetics. Omg my first night using it and my pores look so great! I was so astonished, definitely will be a repeat customer. Also since it's my first night using this cleanser, I'll see how my skin goes or course. But so far I'm in love."
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,,does not take off make up,I wanted to like this product as i am a fan of Fresh. But this was such a disappointment. Not only does it not take my make up off it leaves an oily residue on my face that i have to wash off with a different cleanser. There are many other better oil cleansers out there. I would not recommend this product.
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,,nice ,I used it as the first cleansing oil before my skincare routine. very light and easily washable with warm water. leaves skin moist and ready for the second wash with foam/foreo. 
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,This has officially replaced my makeup wipes,"I was recommended this face wash after a makeup/skin consultation at Sephora. Honestly, I hated it at first. This idea of this oil-based cleaner running my makeup around my face (making me look like a melted clown) really turned me off. But I stuck with it and began to use it nightly after I ran out of my trusty makeup wipes. This cleanser really gets you clean and removed all of my makeup. I feel so clean, I don’t feel the need to double cleanse as I do with a makeup wipe. I typically use a makeup easer-style cloth to wash off the makeup. I have not yet broken out with this product and my skin doesn’t feel dry or pull after I get done. Once you get over the initial oil and melted makeup look, it will really simplify your nightly routine. I have used nearly the entire bottle. If used regularly, I think a bottle can last between 4-6 months, making it worth your $$"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Best pre cleanse!,"This is by far the best 1st step to my double cleanse. I'm 43, have combo skin with dry patches, occasional breakouts and hyperpigmentation and acne scarring. This doesn't make me break out. In fact, when I started double cleansing, it helped reduce my breakouts substantially. I started using this after watching Thataylaa, now Taylor Wynn, on YouTube. It gets all of the mascara and liners off without burning your eyes. Highly recommend!"
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,,So Good!,"Im always on the look-out for an effective cleansing oil that is also safe to use while pregnant and nursing. This one smells so good and removes my make up. Also used the Fresh Soy Cleanser after.  It leaves my skin clean, fresh and soft. "
FRESH-Seaberry Skin Nutrition Cleansing Oil,USA,Give it a try.,"Best cleanser I have tried! I have tried many brands including origins, drunk elephant, Sunday Riley, first aid beauty, belif and many more drugstore brands but nothing compares to this. I cleanses my skin the best way possible and doesn’t leave my skin drying. I love it and I am on my second bottle already."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Not what I thought,"The product would not apply to my face. When I poured a small amount into my palm to transfer it onto my face, it would separate and move like a slimy jelly when I tried to apply it from my hand to my face. I tried several different things but it was an odd slimy cleanser and it did not have any foaming action. My face was not left feeling clean so I did return it. 
I love this line and would not expect this from it."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,amazing,"This cleanser helped my skin become smoother and less visible dark spots. However it is advised to use a moisturizer after so as to avoid dryness. Overall, glycolic acid always does wonders "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,best cleanser of all time on god,"this is my new go-to cleanser, I bought it on a fluke along with the dr.jart cleanser solely because of the price. I was planning to use the dr. jart one as my daily cleanser and this as one to use on occasion when my skin is feeling congested but this has become my daily cleanser! It provides really gentle exfoliation without drying out my skin at all. It literally loosens up the dead skin cells on my face and when I rub my face with my hands they just flake off. I alternate it with the cerave hydrating cleanser in the evening, just to be on the safe side and make sure it really doesn’t dry out my skin/irritate my skin barrier from the daily use, but the way it’s transforming my complexion is blowing my mind."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,Acne prone Oily Skin Rescue,"This product works amazing to scrap off all the sebum from your face after a long day. However, do not forget to moisturize after using this! "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,best,I LOVEEEEEEEEEE CAUSE AFTER CLEANSED MY FACE IT COMES OUT MY FACE GET VERY GLOWING AND IT REALLY MAKE MY FACE LESS OILYYYY would purchase this againnnnnn
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Great Cleanser,This continues to be a cleanser that works! It’s very gentle but has helped greatly with getting rid of acne and for gentle exfoliation. It’s absolutely worth the price. I’ve used this for years and will continue to.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,exfoliator,"i think it is a good face wash exfoliator, its mild and  my face doest feel irritated and just a bit dry after using it, just moisturized your skin after using it. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,Great product for oily or combination skin,"This has been my favourite cleanser for the last 3 years, I use it whenever my face feels oily and/or having outbreak, will help to control oiliness and prevent outbreak. And gives you smoother skin due to AHA! "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,Shopper,"The Glycolic Foaming Cleanser is easy to use, leaving my skin very clean and soft, there’s no tightening to my skin so it’s all good. The subtle scent is pleasant. I’m glad I bought this."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,love it ,"I love the smell and i love how clean my face feels after using it. It’s basically the only face wash i use now days. I have great skin on my naturally, so i havent really seen an improvement. But i really like it "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Strong Scent,This product has a really strong and not very pleasant scent. It also did not appear to do much for my skin.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,good ,Mario’s products never go wrong. this cleanser cleans my face well. it is important to keep our skin well moisturised with toner and moisturiser because cleanser alone is insufficient 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Gycolic Cleanser.,"I like this product. my skin feels great after I use it. When I use it in the shower I can't keep it from getting into my eyes. It stings like crazy. I will look for something milder. Sadly, ,it's not for people with sensitive eyes."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Philippines,One Good Glycolic Cleanser,"It makes my skin a bit dry after using it but that's ok. I have my other skincare items after to keep myself moisturized. It does help with my acne. I work at night and I have oily to combination skin. Plus, I'm also a bit sensitive. Some products give me immediate rashes. But this one works for me. It gives my face a little bit of that tingling effect but it doesn't cause me more acne. It actually helps dry up my pimples. One of the good acne controlling products I use."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,50/50,"Slight perfumed . Leaving skin a bit dry after using . Stop using for face but used for other parts of my body . Will stop
Using it ...................."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,Acne Friendly ,This facewash helped with my mild acne. It leaves your skin feeling very clean but feeling very tight. Its a good face wash but not dry skin friendly.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,Breaks me out,I have sensitive skin and this doesn’t work for me. My face had breakouts right after using this product. The only thing thats good about this product is that it smells good.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,I Stan!,I’m very pleased with this cleanser. I’ve had it for a year at this point. I use it three times a week; helps with my oily buildup from wearing masks all day working. It doesn’t strip my skin or leave it super dry. Just feeling clean and executes my acne trouble on sight! Lasts a long time too!
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,amazing ,Amazing product.......The best i have ever tried in my life........It is a must have in your makeup bag.... Thank you so much sephora for having it.....  Makes my life easier.... 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,Glycolic cleanser,I bought this cleanser for my boyfriend . His skin is combination type . He had tried it for 2 weeks and made his skin dry . The pimple is getting more and more also. No improvement at all...
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,"""resurface""?  more like expunge","""Resurfacing"" is putting it mildly - my skin felt absolutely raw after cleansing with this product.  I didn't care for the scent either, as it has a somewhat chemical odor to it.  It's marketed to all skin types but may be more suitable to normal/oily skin types (which I do not have).  I suppose it's alright for the price, but there are better products on the market that give me a deep clean without completely stripping my already dry skin."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,Ms,Very nice and mild face cleaner the quantity is good to last several months its give a residue free clean feel happy with the product will buy again. Overall value for money 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,"Great Chemical Exfoliant, Not for Sensitive Skin","This is so good for acneic skin. Not sure about the controversy around the ingredients, but this changed my skin. I am using prescription products now with gentle cleanser but for a non-prescription routine, I could not live without this."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,good clenser,Good product to use..Doesn’t cause any breakouts on my skin. My skin feels squeaky clean after using this and it has nice smell as well. I will definitely repurchase
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Less blackheads and smaller pores,"I think this helped my acne and skin texture. After I used it, I had a noticeable glow and in some areas of my face my pores were undetectable. I made the mistake of using it twice a day initially, and had some irritation, but the directions clearly say use only 3 times a week. After using it every other day, it has given me a noticeable glow, decreased blackheads, and less acne. It’s much better than the $40 PTR anti-aging cleansing gel, and at a lower price point. This soap is a solid win."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Love the smell of it! Reminds me of childhood I use it on my body. Nice exfoliating cleanser for bumpy thighs.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Philippines,Mild and effective,Been a fan of Mario Badescu products for years now and this product is as effective as the others. Mild on the skin but does the job. I make sure to hoard Mario Badescu products during sale as they tend to be a bit pricey.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,"I really like this. I saw immediate results. Especially pairing it with the glycolic toner. Unfortunately if it gets in your eye, it’s bad."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,GOOD CLEANSER ,"This cleanser does what it said. It cleans my face well after long day. however it is a bit harsh, i used it 2-3 times a week alternately with my other cleanser"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,Used as gentle exfoliater,Understand that this product is marketed as cleanser but i used it as my weekly exfoliater. It work wonder when i noticed i had tiny bumpy pores in my nose and chin area. This cleanser will clean it off immediately and i will feel my skin become supple and soft again. Repeated for 3 bottles now.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,pigmentations ,"Love this product! - Mom
I Bought this product for my mom for her pigmentations issue. Though it cannot be cured fully it does makes her pigmentations lighter and less visible. 
"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Philippines,mixed feelings,I’m giving it 3 stars cause I don’t know if it’s really working or not. The foamy cleanse and scent puts me off. I trust the brand but for some reason I find this too harsh. Not sure if I will repurchase.i found other cleansers who can give a better exfoliation at a fraction of the cost. 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,LOVEEE,"Ugh! So good!!! One of the best cleansers I’ve tried so far! My skin is a bit sensitive but this cleanser just made my skin feel fresh, it smells amazing and it feels super light. I’ve been using this product for like 2 weeks in my morning routine. I can actually see my skin clearing up and glowing ✨

Totally Recommend!!"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,second time user of a glycolic cleanser,"I have used before other brands of glycolic cleanser and does its job pretty well. I use to have bad breakouts on my face and after using glycolic cleansers, my face cleared up pretty well.  Be sure to use adequate moisturiser and sun screen during the day as may cause skin to be photosensitive."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,cleanser,So far it’s been a great cleanser I’m giving it 4 stars only because I thought it would be more of a foaming when it seems to only be a cleanser. I’ve had it for a week and plan on using it 2-3 times a week.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,garbage,"Sulfate? Fragrance? Parabens? This is complete garbage. I remember using this as a teenage. My face was so irritated, dry and filled with texture."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,worth buying ,"I use it twice a week after cleansing as recommended on the bottle in replacement to my daily cleanser for my Dry - combination skin type. 
It leaves my skin texture clean and supple. definitely not a harsh glycolic cleanser. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,"Very affordable. I only have to use a little bit because it does foam up well and it’s pretty gentle on my skin. I don’t get that tight, stretched feeling after washing. I use it in place of my other cleanser every other night and it really has changed the texture of my skin. It looks and feels smoother. My blackheads aren’t so noticeable and have actually been coming up to the surface and easily removed. I will definitely be buying this again when the time comes."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,"It leaves the skin extremely clean, not at all taut, I love it. I definitely recommend."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,I LOVE IT,I love this so much. The blackhead doesn’t make any appearance after I used this. Combo with MB face mist. Boom there you have it. I have oily skin type. It really works great 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,I use this more often in the summer. I just feel like it does a good job giving a deep cleanse after wearing a lot of sunscreen and sweating all day.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Love it!,Been using for last 10 years.  I only wash my face at night because it cleans so well.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,Perfect Price for a trial introduction to Farmacy! ,"I highly recommend this set to those who are new to the Farmacy brand. I really like the night balm, although a little goes a long way, it is definitely to be used when your skin needs some extra hydration injected."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,"I use this product a couple times a week in place of my regular cleanser. I like to let it sit for a minute or two to do its thing. Definitely feel like it has changed my skin texture for the better. More smooth. Not a game changer I would say, but great for the price! Foams up really well. Kinda makes my eyes water/sting if I’m not careful with rinsing it off."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,"Love it leaves my skin like porcelain, even my friends and coworkers told me, peach perfect glowy and very clean. Easy to rinse and not to harsh for the skin no burning feeling , just with putting a fingertip drop and that’s good for your whole face. 
The only recommendation is too strong for the eyes so be sure to really close tightly your eyes when rinsing. Bought it already 4 times and usually lasts me around 6 months and great price."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,"The perfect cleanser to add to your routine every few days! Good for oily, acne prone skin."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,"My all time favorite, leaves your face smooth and clear. When I notice a bit of acne I’ll just wash my face twice a day, how I regularly do and the next day poof, gone. Very gentle foaming wash perfect for my needs."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Dermatologist Recommended,"I have oily skin with some dry patches and deal with texture. My dermatologist recommended this a good glycolic face wash that would address my texture concerns. I’ve been using it for over a year now and love it. It really helps with texture without overdrying your skin. I definitely notice differences when I apply foundation. Highly recommend if you want a gentle, more affordable, option for a glycolic cleanser. Side note, I also use a topical acne gel, Epiduo, and this cleanser does interact negatively."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,mixed feelings,"i have been using this for over 6 months now. it doesnt foam, so if you're looking for that, skip this. it does however give you that clean feeling. however after awhile it doesnt feel like its doing much for me."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,"Not drying, leaves skin feeling clean. Great for pores."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,Not as drying as i thought,"Read lots of review on how this is a rather drying cleanser on the skin. I didn’t have such problems probably because i hydrate my skin rather intensely. Love the after wash feel, doesn’t make my face feel overly tight and stripped off the natural oils. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,No thanks,"Not a fan. I ran out of my regular glycolic cleanser and thought the price of this was great. They state that’s there’s 1% glycolic acid in there, but I could barely discern any. The one additive that I did notice was an overwhelming (bad) perfume fragrance. I don’t like my face cleansers to have so much perfume as it’s an irritant. I tossed the bottle and am just using Drunk Elephant’s Jelly Cleanser (really nice) until I can find a good glycolic one. This one’s cheap for a reason."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,New Zealand,good ,This product is really good but I found I can only use once a week to week and a half as more frequent use made my skin flake. But after one use my skin looked so glowy. 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,I have combo skin and I live in an arid climate in Colorado.  I use this 3x a week and it helps keep my skin clear. Especially important in my skin care because I'm skipping makeup these days since I wear a face mask when I'm not home. It's very effective.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Surprise Dandruff Relief,"I use this as my face wash in the shower, and it’s great - I recently just discovered that it works ten times better than my dandruff shampoo, too! I wash my hair like normal and rinse, but then lather up some glycolic wash and scrub my scalp. I leave it on and then add conditioner to my ends for a few minutes before washing out. It was amazing how after the first time I had almost zero flakes at all, and my scalp is no longer itchy and uncomfortable. 

I only took away a star because it has a foaming agent in it, and I try to stick with clean products when I can help it. The product itself works wonders."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,"Exceeded expectations! I bought this for the price and the glycolic acid. I’ve been using this for a couple months now, and my skin looks brighter and smoother. I have oily skin, so I use 2-3 times a week and often skip moisturizer at night."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,Works great. Use as directed. Moisturize after each use.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,"Best cleanser I’ve used so far. I have combination skin but I hate cleansers that make my skin feel stripped after washing. This does not make me feel like that, my skin feels very clean and soft after using it. It doesn’t irritate my skin either."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,love it!,I use it three times a week and my face feel smooth every time after using it. I will definitely repurchase. It helps reduce white head and sebaceous filament. 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,effective,"it's pretty nice. i've been using it for a while and it's effective for me, no side effects. can be drying for everyday use so i only use it once or twice a week. since it's an exfoliant i don't leave it too long on my face and use a their rosewater and aloe facial spray after as a light moisturizer.

it's true that a little goes a long way. it's been with me a couple of months now but it looks brand new. it might even last me through the whole six-month state of calamity period :)"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Smooth,I have combo skin that is very oily & dry. This gently exfoliates all my dry patches & removes my oil. It makes my skin feel so smooth after & doesn’t irritate or dry me out. If I don’t use it I notice my foundation doesn’t apply as well. Can’t live without it
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,It's ok,"My dermatologist recommended a glycolic cleanser and I decided to try this one. It does the job but it isn't amazing. It doesn't break my out, but it also doesn't help keep my skin acne free."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,Brilliant ,"I purchased this product because i use to have a mild case of acne. I have dark skin (black women). having used this a few times a week, it made such difference in assisting to fade out dark marks and gave a glowing complexion. I would recommend if your looking for these ingredients in a less harsh manner. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,ok but not great,"Didn’t do anything to clear up clogged pores. Nice as a simple cleanser, but no further benefit. Using more than alternate days irritated my skin. Would not repurchase"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,Mario cleanser ,I have oily skin and it really helps my skin not to appear to be oily ... scent is pretty pleasant ..... price is ok not pricey .... will repurchase again.....
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,"A mediocre product. I used to be obsessed with this, but I honestly think it’s because I didn’t know what else was out there. It foams up nicely, but it just dries out my skin and that’s about it."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,An okay product,Bought this as I read good reviews on this product. However i think it's just a so-so product and doesnt really work well with my skin. i dont think i would repurchase this
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,Miss,This product smells is okay. First time after using the product my face felt dry. I think it’s good to dry out the acne or pimples. But after using it for few weeks my face really dried out.  I have to apply a lot moisturiser to balance it out. I have breakout using this product. I have sensitive combination skin.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,the best ❤️❤️❤️❤️,Started using this amazing product i never get huge pimples anymore!!!! It made my skin a lot smoother and less oily 😊😊 Reallyyyyy good and the price isnt too bad. Definitely buying this again and again. 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,smells like dishwasher ,"Firstly, it smells like dishwasher. Secondly, it stings my eyes big time. It doesn’t foam up very much. kinda cleanses the skin well, but I won’t purchase it again."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,Feels weird & no visible effect,"I bought this product because of it’s good reviews. I was so excited to use it but got disappointed because it did not do anything for my skin. No visible results. I really wanted it to work, but....oh, well. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,Love !,"Really love its smell and texture. Feeling gentle on skin during cleansing, yet feel very fresh and clean after washing face. Mario Badescu never dissapoint me!"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,Nice product ,Thus is actually a nice cleanser and it controlled my breakout but I can only recommend this cleanser if you have oily skin otherwise don’t try it because it will dry out your skin.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,i like it,This cleanser does what it says. At first I was hesitant to try it because the combination of sodium lauryl sulfate and glycolic sounded something that would overdry my skin and leave me with the squeaky clean feel I loath
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,not bad,"I used to use enzyme gel so I wanna try some Mario product which don’t make me down , it allows me less oily but not too dry. I like it as feeling my face is clean . I might buy another one."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,Strong chemical smell,"First impression is the strong chemical smell (guess the bright side is we know that there's no fragrance)
Face feel smooth after cleaning but i can feel significant tight feeling. My face tend to be oilier, guess it's a bit too drying for my skin. Observed discoloration on the cleanser after a month or two and i stopped using it."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Pore minimizing,Every time I use this it leaves my skin looking and feeling amazing. Its minimized my pores so much!!!
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,"Long term use, still didnt like","Ive used this for a few months now as instructed and I do not think it is very effective as a Glycolic wash. The price is good and i reallllly wanted it to work, but not only is it ineffective (the pH isnt low enough), it also contains Sodium Laurel Sulfate which stripped my skin and was very drying. I felt that i had to over compensate in serums and moisturizers. I think if youre looking for an effective glycolic wash, talk to your dermatologist for their recommendation that doesnt contain SLS. You can also just use a regular SLS-free fash wash (drugstore brands!) and then apply an chemical exfoliant after for better results."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,the best!,i’m currently on my 4th bottle now! it is so amazing for me because i have an oily skin. it helps in reducing the oiliness of this face and makes my face very smooth! another score a little goes a long way & the price is very reasonable! LOVE IT. 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,great for oily skin,"This product is great for those with oily skin although it makes my skin dry but nothing that a little moisturizer won't fix. Little bit of the product goes a long way so I think for the price, it was worth it. I might repurchase again."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,Glycolic Cleanser,"Perfect for combination to oily skin. For me it’s best to use twice a week because it will dry you face and don’t forget to put moisturizer after, to get the better result. I suggest to use sunblock on your face so that it will not irritate your face as well. Good job‼️🥂💐♥️"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,great for hyperpigmentation ,"I bought this last time cause i had acnes and etc. My skin is oily combination, it works well to clean and it minimise scarring from post acne. Can be drying for those with dry skin. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,GREAT CLEANSER,"great cleanser! i use this product 3x a week. love this because it gently exfoliates my skin. if youre a lazy bean and dont wanna use other exfoliants, then this is a good alternative"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,Great wash ,Doesn’t dry out skin and Low suds mean it’s not heavy on the usual sulphates. Great for keeping skin clean and glowing. Following up with the aha ceramide moisturiser makes it even better
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,Something new for me,"Tried this for the first time. Mixed it with different cleansers like gel, foam and cream cleansers alternate days. Very light and easy to use. No strong smell. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,a little drying,Leaves my skin Super matte after use which I think is good if you have Super oily skin but maybe not so much if yours is more within the normal to dry spectrum. I prefer products that leave the skin glowing and looking supple so I’m a bit on the fence with this one. I do think that it deeply cleanses as there’s barely any trace of makeup when I tone after washing but it may perhaps be just a tad too drying. 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,great ,Mother says it reminds her of the old-fashioned Cleaners. Works like a charm. Fascinating smell too. Doesn’t strip the skin dry. Might purchase again. 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,my skin has never been brighter,I suffer from hormonal acne and ::fingers crossed:: have been acne free for two+ weeks since using this cleanser. I use it with my Clarisonic about 3 times per week and have noticed a significant difference in my skin’s overall texture and tone. LOVE!
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,My favorite cleanser,"obsessed with this cleanser, it keeps my skin cleae and doesnt strip all the moisture from my face after using it. ive been using it in my chest as well because of some acne spots i had and its been working perfectly. 

For reference i have oily skin, not acne prone (only on my chest and back) and uneven skin tone. I use this 4 days a week and in between use a mild foam cleanser   i alwaya moisturize after using this cleanser."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,Ms,"Bought it and thought it was just a normal face wash but then realised it has some exfoliating effect, so I don’t use it everyday, at most twice a week as a deep cleansing product. Texture and smell are nice. Works for me"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,Mario Badescu,"I am absoutely in love with this brand,delivers great results always. I use this cleanser on alternate days.It thorougly cleanses the face and adds a glow as days goes"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,Amazing!!!,"I actually first tried this with my friend and after using it a weeks I’ve noticed that my face glow especially in the morning and i really like the effect of this on my face. After noticing the effect, I hurriedly purchased this item and this is now part of my holy grail product. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,love love,"I’ve been using this cleanser for about for about 7 months.  I have had problems with hormonal acne on my chin and jaw and occasional cystic acne flare ups.  At first I didn’t read on the label it was only supposed to be used 2-3 a week so I used it every morning and night and was surprised after reading reviews that nothing had happened worsened from doing that.  I was in love with it when I noticed it would clear up my chin acne, however I would continue to get flare ups (and I’m not sure if that’s just my crappy chin or irritation from the product and thats the only reason why i gave 4 stars not 5).  It may be too harsh for me everyday, but I started alternating with CeraVe and it works great.  I will say this product did an amazing job of improving my skin tone, evenness, and pore size and no cleanser has ever made my skin look this great. (I also pair with a calming toner and the Say Yes to Tomatoes moisturizer and it makes my oily skin feel hydrated and has improved its ~oiliness~ a lot!)"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,Feedback,Really good product ! Its works at my first trial! Good product quality ! Really love with this product ! I will keep continue and cant wait next level result!
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,Does not work in my skin,"I only give 3 stars to this product because it doesn’t work for me. When I used it, my skin was fine but after a few days of usage, my face became dry which is unusual because i have very oily skin."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Good size bottle!,"I've only used it about 4 times, but I think it's doing something good! You aren't supposed to use it daily because it's not indicated.  It cleanses well, and foams nicely. I am looking forward to the clearer skin."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,,squeaky clean,"My skin breaks out and this product was a godsend.  I used it every other day and a little goes a long way.  Lathers well, minimal scent and leaves skin soft and smooth."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,I love this face wash! I was looking for a less expensive option to my normal face wash without compromising the ingredients and this was it.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,would recommend for milia,"even though this is a foaming cleanser, it doesn’t foam up much. however, this is a great cleanser for preventing milia! i would purchase this again, and the price is right!"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Foaming Cleanser,USA,Dried out my skin,I used it 4 times and it literally dried out my combination skin.
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Cleanser,Singapore,reasonable,"it seems to contain all the good stuff like prebiotic and lactic acid. it is a cream-based cleanser which does not really foam. the colour is blue though, with a pungent chemical or herbal smell. Hard to describe unless you smell it for yourself. kind of like algae or fermented stuff? "
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Cleanser,Malaysia,Helps my acne but doesn't dry my skin too much,I had a bad assumption at first as I thought this might irritated my skin more seeing as it's said to be on the drying side. But it turns out that my normally dry and sensitive skin like this cleanser very much. The only downside about this product is the price. I'd have to go back to The Inkey List because of it.
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Cleanser,Singapore,No effect,"Finished a whole tube, no foam cleanser. Thought it would be helpful but ended up purging and now have to rectify it. not the best item from this brand"
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Cleanser,New Zealand,love this product,I enjoyed this product. It did leave my skin a bit dry. I think this was a bit harsh on my skin but I do have super sensitive skin. It did the job of cleansing my face real well though 
BOSCIA-Cryosea Firming Icy-Cold Cleanser,Singapore,broken,"First of all it has a strong tingly sensation, some may like it, some may not. I personally have not much preference about the tingling sensation unless it bothers broken skin on my face or my eyes when my eyes get allergic due to my cat allergies. What I’m most upset about is about the PUMP. When I first opened it, the pump was difficult to use. To describe, it feels like an un-greased mechanism. I have to use more force to push down the pump, and the pump stays there!!! It doesn’t spring back up. I tried to rectify it when the pump was still stuck down, tried to pull it up and the top part BROKE. I don’t even know what to do with it now, I can’t use it. Don’t buy this, total waste of my money. I wished I could speak to a Sephora customer service about this but the explanation is too tedious and they wouldn’t do anything about it cuz it’s too late since it’s already been used. Don’t buy this expensive crap and waste ur money. Or maybe I’m just unlucky. And honestly, tried giving zero stars but didn’t go thru so… ONE STAR"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Australia,I like it,"Big fan of the knockout toner so thought I’d give this a go, I’ve only used it a couple of times but so far so good.  As the others mention I wouldn’t use this every evening, would be quite drying"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,New Zealand,Acne Killer!,"The killer of acne! I've always struggles with bad skin, from small spots to lovely great big cystic acne. But finding this stuff was a godsend! I can actually leave the house without make up and my skin doesn't look so awful anymore!!"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Malaysia,Worth trying!,"I would recommend using this once in 2 to 3 days only if you have dry skin. Left my skin felt so clean after a long make up day, but overuse could cause drying skin. Small amount could do the entire face. But will consider buying it again in the future. "
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Australia,Great!,This product was amazing. It left my skin feeling clean and I have been using it 3 times a week. It also has a nice smell. The texture is nice and you don’t need to use a lot.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Malaysia,Ms.,"my holy grail. i got cystic acne on my chin and this helps to prevent the acne from coming up, it also smoothen out my skin texture, I use once daily in the pm to remove all makeup and impurities. the small one last me for 2 months. worth the money, i dont ned extra exfoliator other than this. its also gentle enough to be used daily. everytime i used this, my skin care absorb skin care much better which make my fines lines faded and and my moisturizer blend so well."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Singapore,Good and afforable ,Tried the sample size and really like it.  It cleans very well and not harsh on skin.   Smells good and afforable.  Can use it on alternate days for exfoliating. 
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Malaysia,Good,"I love how my face feels after using it, doesn't stings. A pea size amount is all I need, when I cleanse with this product. However, I might not purchase it again as it cost an arm and a leg. "
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 124ml,"Has a nice texture but made me break out all over in little bumps. I gave it to a friend with less sensitive skin, who seems to enjoy it. Would recommend you get a sample before committing."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Australia,Lord,"This work amazingly, my mother will go out of her way to purchase it."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Australia,Average ,I didn't find this exfoliator to be better or worse than others I have tried in the past. 
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Singapore,favourite cleanser,"Love this cleanser. I first tried this when I got a sample, and was surprised by how much I like it. This cleanser has a minty feeling and I love how my skin feels refreshed after using this."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Australia,love ,"Love this, this is actually a second choice because they don’t have the caudalie exfoliator available. I think a little bit pricey for its size. Still a good exfoliating cleanser! "
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Australia,LOVE,Great product. Great ingredients! 
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Malaysia,okay ,I’m not sure what was the hype about this product. This is in gel consistency and I’m not sure this actually worked on my skin and I can’t see removing my dead skin cell. Will see how it goes after several applications.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,not for long term,"First weeks/months I used it, it cleaned my face from acne but I wouldn’t recommend for long term cause my acne came back later."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 124ml,Amazing for acne or blackhead prone skin! gentle yet exfoliating - if my pores feel clogged only one use and i notice an improvement!
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,Great ‘reset’ for skin,Amazing!! At first when you use an exfoliating chemical face wash aka AHA your skin will be rough and irritated. This is NORMAL! Your skin is renewing itself and the cell process is sped up.  The exfoliation removes dead skin and allows imperfections from beneath the skin surface to basically come out. This is a phase called purging. It’s temporary. Once your skin renews and the process has done it’s job your skin will be soft and clear.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Singapore,cleanser,"First time trying out this cleanser.  It cleans without feeling too squeaky clean and yet it feels refreshing.  After a week use, it helps to clear out some of my acne.  "
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,New Zealand,Love it,Have been using as a once daily treatment cleanser and is working well at treating clogged pores and acne. Nice formula with cooling feeling and doesnt overly strip or dry out my skin. Replaced all my physical exfoliants and already seeing a big difference  
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Australia,Wasn't a fan,"Wasn't my favorite exfoliator, you can get much cheaper and better ones "
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 124ml,Depending on your skin type you might really like this but for me it was too much my skin started to flake and everything.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,Baby Smooth Face,This is my favorite new cleanser! Nothing else has left my face feeling so soft!
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,Refreshing!,I used this as my morning face wash and it’s super refreshing. I think it also helped cleared my whiteheads for a few days (but they came back lol). It does dry me out a bit but i tone and moisturize afterwards so it turns out fine. Personally I love the cool feeling it leaves me with.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,love it!,"I love this cleanser! I use it in the am and the smell is so refreshing, it helps wake me up! My skin feels so smooth and my pores seems smaller. It doesn’t leave your skin with that tight feeling either. I only gave 4 stars cause I haven’t been using it very long yet, but I’m sure I’ll repurchase in the future!"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 124ml,I got a lot of breakouts and small pimples. I never have this bad experience before.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,Sun Burn Warning,"Cute package, strong but nice smell. However. Word to the wise. There is a big warning on it about sun damage and how the AHA increases risk of sun burn. Literally says don’t go in the sun for a week after use. So. I didn’t even end up using it once I read that. Not worth in summer time or any time. The warning, btw, was hidden under another sticker."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 124ml,"I use this cleanser on the rough skin on my arms and my face. My arms have been looking better since I started using it. It has a fresh, almost eucalyptus-like fragrance and doesn’t burn or sting."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,Quick exfoliater,I use this on days I wear makeup. Makes my skin super smooth. I rub a dime size amount into my face and let it sit a minute or so before rinsing.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 124ml,This product really helps with exfoliating and preventing breakouts. I usually let it sit on my face for 1-2 mins while I shower. A small amount goes a far way. Please make sure to use sunblock in the day to avoid any sunburn. Do not mix with retinol or you will give your self a chemical burn.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Australia,love ,"I really love the knockout range from tarte it’s actually really good and powerful. I use it every second day. 











































"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Australia,great for blackheads ,"Gets really foamy and I love to use it when I need to get a deep clean, but definitely got to moisturise after because it leaves the skin feeling a little tight and dry after. "
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Australia,love it ,This feels really great on my skin. I use it about 3 times a week as I feel if I used it daily it might dry my skin out. Skin feels really fresh and clean after. 
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Malaysia,tarte cleanser,tarte cleanser realky good for my skin last time i am using the local chemical product not suitable for my skin after i using this tarte cleanser really good for my skin last time i have alot pimple and blackhead omg that time i was so worried after using this 2month i can see alot diffrent in my face now i happy for my face love it and amazing cleanser😍❤🌹
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,New Zealand,love it,great cleanser for oily skin. only bought a small pack to try and seriously loving it. tried to buy it back but it is out of stock hopefully can buy soon before small pack finished
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Singapore,fungal acne safe ,"honestly I've been looking for a cleanser that is not only fungal acne safe but also good for oily skin without SLS in it. it has been a tough hunt but I've finally found my holy grail cleanser and this is it. I have studied the entire ingredients list in this and it really does not get better with other cleansers. this is good for people with combination, oily, blackheads/whitehead skin problems as well as fungal acne problems. this is also for with oily yet sensitive skin at the same time. I am all 5 of these problems and this is one of the best products that work for all those concerns and does not contain any fungal acne triggering ingredients. buy this if you are someone who has oily yet sensitive skin, or a fungal acne sufferer. "
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Australia,love,"A little goes a long way, but both me and my partner enjoyed using it. Deffinetly found it helped clear some of my face up quickly, didn't feel a tingly or burning feeling "
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,disappointed,So disappointed burned my skin and totally dried it out!!! I was so red it looked like sunburn and had little bumps all over my face!!!!
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,Helps with mascne,"Great cleanser, skin feels super clean and has really helped lessen my mascne. Highly recommend a good moisturizer to follow, though."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Australia,nice,"I would definitely purchase this product again. I love all the tarte products that I have tried so far! This has a nice texture too it, and a nice colour
"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 124ml,This literally changed my skin in 2 uses. Way fewer bumps and pores are teeny. Smells like peppermint and tea tree. This is the STUFF
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,Cooling but not great for cystic acne,"I struggle with pretty bad cystic acne on my chin, cheeks, and forehead. this product was pretty good at reducing the redness (because of the mint) but didn't do much for clearing/ preventing my type of acne. I didn't get any new whiteheads or blackheads using it tho, so ppl with that type of acne may find it helpful"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,Might not be for the acne prone,My skin feels great and my black heads are gone but it did nothing for my acne. I've been using this for about 2 months and my skin is pretty ruff.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Australia,good cleanser,"I have been using this cleanser almost every day for about 8 months and still have some left in the bottle! As for my skin, I’m unsure if it’s doing anything as I can’t notice a big difference. Smells lovely and does the job!"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,A good first cleanser,"This is pretty mild and did not irritate my skin. It has a pleasant minty-fresh smell and feeling, and definitely makes my skin (which can be oily after a long day) feel refreshed and not greasy after use. I'm not sure to what extent this product exfoliates (other than that it says it has AHA + BHA), so I have moved on to a more gentle cleanser + an exfoliating toner. However, this is still a good go-to cleanser when I am lazy."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,oily & or acne prone? this is for u,"I’ve struggled with blackheads on my nose my entire teen & adult life and nothing could seem to get rid of them- except taking a loofa too my face and scrubbing them off completely- which is so damaging to my skin! But this stuff, after a couple of consistent uses and gotten rid of them completly and because it’s daily it keeps them away! Not to mention I haven’t noticed any other new acne on my chin which has always had problems. This stuff is AMAZING and heavy duty. I’m obsessed. If you have normal or sensitive skin, I don’t know if this is for you, I bought the smaller size to test and I’d suggest you do the same if you’re thinking about this product."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,Very nice cleanser but mini is overpriced,"Great cleanser but mini is overpriced for being only 30mL when the full-size product is approximately 120mL. Many other minis are 60mL or half of the full-sized product volume for the same price. The cleanser lathers nicely but is not for eye makeup removal nor should it get near your eyes. It did make my toner sting my sting for the first week, but that has stopped now. I only use this cleanser in the morning because I prefer a cleanser/makeup remover at night. I do recommend this product, but not the mini because it is so overpriced. That is why it has a 3-star rating."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,It's perfect,"The best exfoliator! No beads but scrubs my pores just as well if not better! I find that exfoliators with beads are too rough for my face, so this is perfect! I use 2-3 times a week with a silicone scrubber. Doesn't dry out my skin. Smells good- lightly minty-smell disappears quickly which is also nice."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,The Best Cleanser I have ever used.,Love this cleanser. I bought the mini to try it out and I love it. I use to only use Purity and it is just not the same anymore.  I love the sensation and smell of Tarte's Knockout. Buy the large tube. You won't regret it.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,Nice cooling mint face wash,Best face wash. It leaves your face feeling fresh and soft. Has a nice mint smell and feel to it.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,let it sit!,I am such a big fan of TARTE's skincare and had to try this. You'll need to let it sit on your face for about 30 seconds before the tingling starts but it's SO worth it. my skin is so so soft after and it's been helping my makeup apply much smoother!
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,New Zealand,Good,"This is a good product. If was cheaper I would buy again, only annoying thing the scent is quite strong and can sting your eyes. But besides from that a good product "
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 124ml,"This is my go-to, every day wash. It doesn’t hurt my face but I feel it getting clean! I love the minty scent too! I will never buy another face wash and I hope this doesn’t get discontinued!"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,So disappointed :(,I was really excited to try this product out. However this stuff made me break out worse than when I forget to wash my face.  I really had high hopes for this product as I love Tarte Eyeshadows! :(
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,Love this!,"Great product for clear clean skin, wet face & then wash. A dime size amount is all it takes, has worked wonders on my dark spots along with the matching toner."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 124ml,I love this cleanser!! I’m 36 and it’s really made a difference in the texture and tone of my face. I use it with the tingling treatment toner and the moisturizer.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 30ml,"This ruined my skin. This says it can be used daily, but when I used it daily it made my skin rough and patchy. I felt more congested after using this, which is not my goal."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,Good product.,This product smells and feels great.  No complaints.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,GET THIS.,"YESSSS! This stuff is amazing. It is a gentle cleanser, but definitely tingles on the skin (not in a burning or painful way). I have been using this as my nighttime cleanser and it has been a game changer. My skin feels cleaner. Previously I would remove my makeup and do a cleanser with a silicone mitt to help exfoliate and clean the skin... I don't need that anymore. This is amazing."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,works great,"I bought this for my 13 year old daughter who is suffering with bad acne. we have tried numerous products and just about everything made her breakouts worse. until I got this. so now once a day she uses this in the evening and within a week, we started noticing a difference and it didn't make her breakouts worse. the funny thing is, I broke out last week and decided to try it too since it was working for her but I woke up the next day with rash. kinda looked like sunburn but bumpy. I do have eczema and sensitive skin so that does happen when I try new face products. but it did and is working for my daughter who has combo skin. no eczema or anything. just bad acne"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,Honestly Don't get this ...,"If you have sensitive skin do not get this. I read reviews first and they were very misleading. I thought it would be gentle and good to unclog my pores... This made my skin look AWFUL I only used it twice and my face broke out everywhere!  I typically do not get breakouts, and all my skin care products are from Tarte. I love the brand and their Sea collection. I would however 100% Not recommend this product."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 124ml,I really like the smell of this cleanser. I use it with my clarisonic and it lathers up nicely. Would definitely recommend.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Australia,"Wish I had bought 2, or 3.","If I had know how regularly I would want to use this I would have bought 1 for the shower, 1 for the vanity and probably one for my boyfriend. The gentle exfoliation is delightful and leaves you feeling fresh and ready to face the day or head to bed. You feel super clean but not ""scrubbed dry"". The fragrance is something I love but can't pinpoint what it brings memories of. I can see this tube emptying quickly and being replaced by multiples more as it becomes a staple in the house. "
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 124ml,I'm in my mid 30's and still have acne prone skin unfortunately. have been using this for 3 weeks and noticed a really great change in the overall appearance of my skin and minimal breakouts now generally hormonal related. I've even gotten compliments on the appearance of my skin looking so much better and brighter. not using any other skin care creams besides benzoyl peroxide at this time. I only deducted a star because I was hoping like other reviews for it to be more exfoliating with beads or such but it still leaves my skin pretty clean and fresh! I def recommend to try!
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,Would not recommend! Just Awful,"I rarely get breakouts, at most I usually get some clogged pores. I had bought this product thinking it would be a gentle enough for my skin and not cause anything weird, since it literally has 'DAILY' in the title. This made my skin look awful! I only used it twice, 3 days apart to not over do it... and my face broke out all over, and I swear every single pore on my face was clogged after using this. Obviously this is not what anyone would want to happen!"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,Worth it!!!!,"I adore this cleanser. Lots of reviews complain about there not being granular exfoliants, but the formulation of this cleanser works harder than any physical exfoliant I’ve used. My skin has never been better since using this wash. I use it at night only, after washing my makeup. I use a BHA/AHA serum in the evening with it for the maximum chemical exfoliant experience."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 124ml,"I really do like this product, My skin feels soft and fresh. However It doesn’t necessarily feel like an exfoliate with the scrubbing beads/salt. Nevertheless it’s a great face wash."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 124ml,Meh. I really wanted there to be an actual exfoliant (grain) like the Tata Harper one and I was disappointed. Otherwise it’s a face wash. I will likely take it back and either get the Tata Harper one again or try the blueberry bounce by Glow Recipe.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,super gentle aha/bha cleanser,i love this stuff. most aha/bha products tend to be too strong for my face and leaves it red and irritated. but this stuff is super gentle and works great. i like how focused this product is on their ingredients.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 30ml,I love the smell of this - minty & fresh. Gentle enough for sensitive skin or every day use.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 30ml,I’m absolutely IN LOVE! Smells so clean and left my skin feeling refreshed!
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 124ml,Horrible product. I have semi sensitive skin and this made me break out horribly. I even tried to pair it with their moisturizer and blemish bully and all of the products made me break out so badly. I highly recommend to NOT use this product!!
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,absolutely love this stuff!!,"I got the 1 oz size to try out this product and it’s amazing. I’ve noticed a big difference in my skin since using it. My breakouts usually include some bumps/white heads and a couple zits, and they’ve cleared up a lot since using this. My biggest issue is my pores & t-zone and this has really helped minimize pores and keep me balanced. Plus the smell is refreshing and you do get a lot of product for the price. Will definitely buy a full size product when I run out of the mini!"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,The Best Cleanser Ever!!!,"I cannot rave about this enough and here are the things I wish other reviews had mentioned!
- You only need a little bit and it goes a long way so this is actually an amazin price for how much product you get!
- It completely fixed my deep cystic acne problem
- It didn't tingle or hurt, it simply felt cold like I stuck my head in the freezer. Very refreshing!
- I was worried it would be too harsh on my sensitive skin. It wasn't! It left my skin soft and smooth and lovely!
- I use this after my oil cleanse and it's STILL not too harsh and it's not drying at all.
- There is no alchohol or plastic or harsh fruit like lemon or fragrance in this and it's truly clean.

I will never use another cleanser ever again and this is the best thing that has ever happened to my skin. If you're debating trying it - 100% do it! I wish I could shout that from teh rooftops!"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,Always a tarte girl,"LOVE IT....I love the tingling feeling, the smell, everything! It leaves my skin feeling amazing and it works great for the little bumps I develop on the outer edges of my face. I use it with the toner and have noticed a HUGE difference"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 30ml,"No real exfoliation going on here. Bummer! I love the brand, but not this product"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 124ml,I absolutely love this face wash so far. It leaves my skin feeling clean without over drying my face it's also helped with my acne I've been using for about two weeks and I've noticed a huge difference
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,AWESOME for acne!!!!!!,"I am in LOVE with tarte's new knockout cleanser-- I use this in the PM along with their knockout toner (in the AM I use humane BP face wash). This cleanser had made such a positive impact on my facial acne! I use to get bad flare ups--- especially around my cycle, but after using this for several weeks, I barely get any breakouts. I don't find this harsh or drying at all on the skin, but I am also used to using BP and acids on my face. HIGHLY recommend!!!!"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,Back saver!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I first tried the cleanser on my face because I have hormonal acne. Didn’t really like it. BUT. Last month I stopped taking my birth control pill and my back started to breakout so bad, I’ve never seen my back being that worse. So I asked myself what I could do for it to heal and get better. I remembered I had this cleanser and since it’s full of AHA-BHA, I gave it a try my my back (near my neck and my shoulders). IT.WORKED.LIKE.WONDERS. My back is getting so much better within just a week! Would definitely recommend for body acne."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,Smooths your skin,By far one of my favorite cleansers. My skin looks bright and clean right after use because of the AHA/BHA formula working to get rid of dead skin cells and smooth out my face. I would recommend using a moisturizer right after though because it can be a little drying.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,love!!!,This has cleared up my skin so much! Every time I use it my skin looks so glowy and moisturized after. I love it & will definitely be re purchasing.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,Favorite Cleanser!,"I love this cleanser! It smells so good, and I like the mini size. I totally recommend this!"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,Decent cleanser,"I find this to work as a normal cleanser. I have sensitive combo skin and I didn't experience any bad side effects, I just really didn't see the exfoliating factor or much change in my skin other than being clean. If you're looking for exfoliation, this is not it."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,new find,I was using another aha cleanser before that was almost double the price but this one is stronger and leaves my skin so soft. It exfoliates so well and smells amazing like eucalyptus. It’s a wonderful product!
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,NO NO NO NO,"Holy crap this made my skin extremely irritated and dry. After 5 days of using this my skin felt like it was on fire every time I washed it. I returned the cleanser, switched to something gentler and have had no irritation since. Nope nope nope."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,Unbelievably good,"This has become my favorite cleanser since I got bought the small sample size. 
Keep in mind though I'm not a stranger to acids so my skin is not sensitive to them. Makes my skin super soft"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,Hate the smell,I ended up giving this to my cousin because I absolutely despised the smell of it.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 124ml,Made my skin feel really dry and itchy and really red
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,My Face ❤ It!!!!,"I purchased to switch weekly, or every three days with my current Cerave Renewing Exfoliating SA cleanser. I'm 30 so my skin is going through some changes, from oily skin to combo, Acne Prone to Highly Reactive Sensitive skin. It's a rollercoaster!! So I read the comments on this product, did some research online, watched many of youtubers talking about this cleanser and I made my mind up and got it. The AHA and BHA helps with removing dead skin and gently exfoliates with stripping my face bone dry. My face has a healthy glow to it with smooth baby skin texture to the face. AND the smell?!  WINNER!!!!!

HAPPY CLEANSING!!!!"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,give it a shot! I don't care for tart usually!,I really like this! it seems to work great! it has a lil mint smell but not over whelming!  I did not like the toner it was more than a tingle it stung/burned my face! I actually bought this in store
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,love this!,I definitely love this! This is a great gentle exfoliator and smells amazing!
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,changed my acne prone skin for the better,"I initially got a sample because I was excited to try the AHA/BHA blend. The results were almost immediate with getting rid of acne. I follow up with the milk beauty vegan moisturizer and, my skin has never felt so good. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling stripped and it’s great because you can use it every day."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 124ml,"I usually use a different exfoliating cleanser, but it’s almost $50, so I decided to try this since it was cheaper. It smells like peppermint which I love, leaves my skin feeling tingly and clean, soft and smooth. Really liking this so far!"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,"Great for me, but probably not for everyone","This does a better job of targeting my blemishes than several acne-specific products I've tried - and I don't think it claims to be firming, but my skin certainly feels more toned after using it. I'm glad I didn't buy it for its alleged hydrating properties, though: my skin is on the oilier side of combination, and I need to have a heavy-duty moisturizer on hand and ready to apply once I've rinsed. And while I think any redness it leaves behind looks more like a healthy glow than irritation, I can see why that might be an issue for someone else. I like to work it in with a pore cleansing pad, so maybe stick to a gentle fingertip massage if that's a concern."
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,Caused breakouts,"This caused breakouts on my normally clear skin. Maybe it was too stripping, but once I stopped using it all of the breakouts stopped!"
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,great for hormonal acne,I have been using this product for my hormonal acne along my chin and it has helped significantly. It left my skin feeling clean and not dry. I use the toner also from this line. It’s excellent.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,if you like ExfoliKate this is for you,I use This cleanser in conjunction with the knockout toner. I love them both! I use after a double cleanse with my Foreo. Has helped combat congested pores and texture. Also smells like eucalyptus which is refreshing. Would recommend this as another option for someone who likes the Kate Somerville ExfoliKate cleaner because it’s cheaper! However I have dry skin and it made my cheeks feel a little tight afterwards - pairing with an oil helped balance after cleansing.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,It just wasn’t my go too,I just didn’t love it. I expected more out of so much hype. Made my skin quite red and didn’t do much for exfoliation or blemishes.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,Canada,Absolutely love it,I recently purchased this product online and I must say this is definitely a new holy grail to my skin care routine. My skin feels so much cleaner and soft after using it and love how my skin gets that tingly feeling when I am scrubbing my face. Little bit of the product goes along way. Definitely will be repurchasing again.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,tarte Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser - 30ml,Works & smells great! I purchased the mini just to try it out. Gentle not rough exfoliation. I love tarte products.
TARTE-Knockout Daily Exfoliating Cleanser,USA,Added to my knockout routine!,"Love it! I am a huge fan of the original knockout toner.. this smells clean and refreshing.. leaves your skin feeling clean, not tight or stripped. Follow up with the toner and a serum and moisturizer and you’re good to go."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Malaysia,amazing cleanser,sangat puas hati dgn hasilnya yg mengagumkan. hanya perlu mnggunakan sedikit shj..sudah memadai utk mndptkan kesan yg menakjubkan. harga sedikit mahal tetapi berbaloi digunakan
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Australia,great for my sensitive skin,beautiful consistency and smell. A little goes a long way. Leaves my skin soft and helps to reduce redness and pore size. I love this product will buy again.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Australia,good but not great ,"I like the gel to milk consistency however it can be difficult to wash off, and needs a lot of water. despite this it's great in that it removes almost all make up without break outs "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,"this was a really good jelly cleanser! the only problem is that it didn't glide so well like I thought over my face. It pulled my skin as I spread it over, and since I'm 30 the least I want to do is cause more tension to the skin. Otherwise, it removed makeup very very well and left my skin so smooth."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Ok,"The texture of this is nice super thick and emulsifies fine. To me the product reminds me of Vaseline with the thickness and smell of it, I don’t mind at all. The effectiveness for me is ok it takes of my face makeup and eyeliner but for mascara you kind of have to rub and rub to get off and it honestly bugs my eyes. Can’t open them or else it hurts. And with lipstick it’s not that great at taking off I have to go in with something else for my lips"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,"Perfect Texture, no makeup removal",I’ve been using this cleanser for about 2-3 weeks and it is very soft and feels nice but doesn’t remove makeup. If you want a regular cleanser that doesn’t remove makeup this is good!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,doesn’t remove makeup & pale color,"I was so excited to try this-especially because of the fun color. Turns out it’s a very sheer pale color! Very off throwing. It’s def a moisturizing cleanser but it does not remove my Makeup all the way. Regardless I always double cleanse if I wear makeup, but normally my first step will remove all my makeup! This leaves so much eye Makeup behind. 
Also I don’t like how once you add water, it barely lathers. It 5% lathers out of a 100%."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Will definitely buy again and again and…,"My new favorite, absolutely love how it changes to an oil then milky when water is added. I feel squeaky x clean, but not stripped. Love, love, love!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,"It’s a no, bring back the good stuff !!","This was supposed to be the bright new thing to replace the Tea Tree + Squalane cleanser? In comparison: garbage, my skin still feels like it’s not fully cleansed after washing (double cleansed AND with a brush) but it’s irritating 
t-zone and giving me acne again in return?? If biossance had any sense, they’d bring back the tea tree."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,A Great Gentle Cleanser,"I really enjoy this as a gentle, first-step cleanse. I will often wash my face with just this in the morning, and in the evening I will use this then the Youth to the People Kale Cleanser. It removes my sunscreen and eye makeup with no issue. It has a pleasant, natural smell that I enjoy. My only complaint about this product is that mine looks nothing like the photos or even other reviewer's photos. Mine has a clear, jelly consistency but I have basically no pink in mine. I figure this is probably just a different batch and it hasn't affected my experience negatively, but I don't like the inconsistency. Overall great cleanser and comparable to the Inkey List Oat Cleanser (the Biossance one is less greasy feeling)"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Nothing Special,"Very average cleanser. It does the job as most Biossance products do, but isn't special."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Clogged the drain,"I like the texture and smell of this product. It was effective for removing makeup and cleansing without over drying. Unfortunately, it majorly clogged my sink drain!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Good for removing makeup,dont mix with water until ready to cleanse your face. i dont really feel my face is clean after using this cleanser but it seems to be a good face wash for removing makeup.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,I love this product! It 100% removes my make-up. It really is a (slightly sticky) jelly that turns milky white when you massage your face with water. I remove it with a wet face cloth and it leaves my skin squeaky clean.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Save your money,"Did not like this at all! Very weird film on your face even after you wash. Sooo many better cleansers out there, save your money."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Don’t waste your money,"I love biossance but I gotta say this is the worst product they’ve come out with. Feels tacky, doesn’t really remove makeup, and leaves a film after u wash it away so def not good as a sole cleanser either."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Not my favourite from biossance,I tried this cleanser to compare it to the other biossance cleanser (the one in the pump) and this one does not compare. It doesn’t have a lather- and maybe it’s all in my head but the lack of lather just doesn’t make my skin feel clean at all. The packaging is annoying. The cap is cheap and doesn’t always completely close causing the product to leak and pool in the cap. I would usually roll my eyes at a complaint about packaging being cheap; but I did find this to be a flaw. Not a fan of the scent either. I’ll be going back to the other biossance cleanser which is a dream product along with other hard hitters. This one was just a miss for me.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,"I love how it doesn’t leave your skin dry after using it. The consistency is very different compared to what I’m used to and I love that! Definitely recommend for dry skin, idk about oily skin."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Worthwhile splurge,"I love this stuff. I don't wear much make up, so I can't speak to it as a makeup remover, but it works great for a thorough cleanse. Also, a great smelling product, which is a nice bonus. I follow it up with YTTP air-whipped moisture cream."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Australia,Very effective at removing makeup,"I really enjoyed using this as a first cleanse - it very gently and effectively removed makeup and sunscreen. However, I found that it left a slight oily residue on my skin, so I always followed up with a foaming cleanser. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Australia,Great texture,I really enjoy this cleanser for when I travel. Lovely colour and the gel consistency is great. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,The formula is very nice but its hard to control the amount being dispensed. A pump bottle would probably work better.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Australia,LOVE THIS!,Removes my sunscreen and makeup perfectly! Love the colour and texture as well. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Terrible,Sticky texture like fruit jelly and made my skin feel extremely dry. No idea why this product is popular except for the cool pink color…
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,"I decided to try this as my usual squalane cleanser was out of stock. I am really loving it and it will likely be my new ""usual"". It is soft and has a nice smell and seems to remove most if not all of my very light makeup, I always double cleanse anyway with a second product so I can't attest if it leaves a film or doesn't remove everything. Price point is a bit higher than I would like but I like the ingredients and the brand. I'm very happy I gave this a try!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Light oil base cleaner,"Works well to remove light makeup and/or sunscreen, but it does leave a film behind, you should follow up with a regular cleanser afterwards to get rid of the film. It will not remove heavy makeup way, it’s too light for that. Overall nice oil based cleanser."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Thought it was cool to have a pink working cleanser. It just ended up being a pink cleanser to me. It probably works for someone else. But it didn’t take off my makeup and after going in with a miscellar pad I still found my skin a bit dirty.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Luxurious and not drying!,"Feels heavenly! My fave dries out from just about ever cleanser, but this leaves my face feeling clean and comfortable (not tight). The gel is more like a very very very light balm, and turns into a lovely foam. Rinses clean. Love this clean, climate friendly brand!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Best cleanser!,"I absolutely love this cleanser!! The key is to follow the instructions - start with dry hands and a dry face to apply it, massage it in (which feels so nice), THEN add warm water to emulsify and finally rinse. I wear thick zinc sunscreen multiple times a week when I’m surfing, and it takes it completely off with no residue and my skin feels amazing. Makeup removal is super easy too. It’s moisturizing without feeling greasy or oily."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Worth my money!!,Love it! Takes my makeup off and helped me with my hormonal acne. Will buy again!!!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Love,I love this cleanser! Definitely my go to. The color is also super pretty
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Just alright,"I use lots of Biossance products and this is the first one I won't be repurchasing. You have to give this cleanser some time to warm up on your hands/face to get the full makeup removing effects as it transitions from the jelly consistency to an oil. It emulsifies well and rinses clean with minimal effort. A good first step in a double cleanse but not my favorite, also not a big fan of the very powerful scent."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,"So gentle and it worked great on my dry, sensitive skin.  It removed  my full coverage foundation and eye makeup effortlessly.  Upon rinsing I took a cotton pad and there was no trace of any makeup residue. This cleanser made my skin feel so soft and it wasn’t  irritating and did not make my skin feel tight like most cleansers I’ve used. Highly recommend!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Love it!,"Okay so the name “Jelly Cleanser” is a little confusing, I have to admit. It’s not a gel cleanser, it’s a true jelly. But if you use it as directed, it really does remove most of your makeup and leaves your skin nice and soft. I love this as my first cleanse, my skin feels amazing after using i! Doesn’t make you feel like your skin is too tight or stripped. Will definitely be repurchasing!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Australia,Not strong enough to cleanse my pores,This cleanser sadly wasn’t strong enough to cleanse my pores. I don’t wear makeup often so I was mostly washing serums and sunscreen off with this cleanser and it did not help control breakouts like other cleansers. This is definitely a cleanser to use if you do double cleansing and wear a lot of makeup. This would be the one you use first and then you should go for something different to actually cleanse your skin and pores. Wanted to love it. The colour and consistency was super nice. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Not worth the hype. World recommend an oil cleanser instead
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Great For Sensitive Skin,I absolutely am in love with this product. I have very sensitive skin that I was told to be dehydrated also. It is extremely difficult for me to find any products that my skin likes. My skin has been loving the entire biossance line. I've tried basically all of their products. I especially love the face wash because it cleans my face but does not feel squeaky clean or that dry tight feeling that other face washes have (this means that your skin was ripped of the natural oils and I do not think that is good). however biossance truly even helps my pimples and white heads. I do not use this as makeup remover . I do double cleanse with another washer and they both work very well together.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,A strange cleanser,I would recommend this as a morning cleanser but at the end of the day you'll want something more substantial.  Im not a fan of the consistency and it doesnt feel like its that effective
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,"This cleanser does fine as a first step in double cleansing. It's mediocre for eye makeup removal. I wish it didn't have any flower or herb extracts, but it does. I don't plan on buying more when I'm out of this."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,My skin feels soooo clean,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This cleanser removes the minimal makeup I do wear and leaves my skin feeling so clean and refreshed. It smells a bit like jam (in a good way) and you don’t need much to get the job done.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,"*sigh* I reallllly wanted to love this. But it’s just missing something. It does a mediocre job at removing. Makeup and you have to make it super watery for it to effectively remove anything. I feel like my skin wouldn’t get very clean. If you don’t wear a lot of makeup this would probably work very well for you, but not if you are washing off a full coverage foundation."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Too heavy and thick.,"My skin type is dry and sensitive and this cleanser is too thick and heavy to be used on its own.

It doesn’t do a great job of removing makeup: I usually have to pre-remove makeup with another MU remover then wash with this then double cleanse with a less heavy cleanser or else I feel a ton of residue on my face

Usually I LOVE Biossance but this was a miss for me."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Heavenly Jelly Cleanser Balm,"If I could marry a skincare line it would be Biossance! Every thing they make is perfection, including this jelly cleanser! This is like a jelly cleanser/cleansing balm/oil hybrid…I’ve never tried anything like it. It squeezes out as a pretty pink jelly into your hand, you apply it to dry skin like a cleansing balm and as you rub it in it transforms into a oily balm. The smell is amazing and the plus is it’s just the natural smell of the effective ingredients, nothing added for scent. I’m assuming it’s the elderberry that smells good, which also gives it that cute pink color. After you massage it into skin for a minute you can add a bit of water and it will become a milky kind of lather that you can then rinse off. I use this as my first cleanse at night or as my only morning cleanser. It definitely makes you look forward to your skincare routine! Highly recommend!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Singapore,Not what I was expecting…,I wanted a gel cleanser for the shower and whilst this is technically a gel it doesn’t really work like a gel cleanser. If you apply this to a wet face it won’t really work and I can see what some people didn’t feel like it worked if they used it this way. When used on dry skin it actually feels and acts like an oil. When you add some water it then turns into a milky water and washes off. Not exactly what I was after TBH but it doesn’t dry my face out either so that’s a plus. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Not very good,I typically love Biossance products but this cleanser doesn’t work very well. The jelly comes on sticky so it doesn’t easily glide around your face to thoroughly clean it and doesn’t do a good job at removing your makeup. Double cleansing is a must because this cleanser doesn’t remove everything. It also does leave a filmy feeling on your face so I wash again to make sure I get all the cleanser off my face. I won’t be using this again.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,My go-to for now.,"This has become my go-to cleanser. I suffer from rosacea, very reactive and sensitive acne-prone skin, and while my redness reacts (as it does with anything I apply, literally) as I’m applying this, by the time I rinse it off with tepid water, it’s completely calmed down. This removes makeup well and is mostly hydrating (again, I’m an anomaly and even the most “hydrating” cleansers and moisturizers still leave me at least somewhat dry), and I love that the ingredients are simple and clean. I’m only giving this 4 stars because there’s nothing that exists in the market that I’ve tried that is perfectly formulated to my skin, but my tendency to repurchase this really speaks volumes."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Filmy & difficult to remove,"I wish I liked this but it was way too filmy and hard to remove, it did nothing to remove the minimal makeup I had on.  I had to use a different cleanser to clean this one off. I love that this company is cruelty free & vegan but their products are a miss for me."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,"I was excited to try this at first after seeing positive reviews. But shortly after, I just wanted to finish the bottle so I could go back to my usual cleanser. I don’t feel like I got a good clean, had a strong smell that I didn’t love."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,no residue,Love it! I think it did a good job removing my makeup but I don't wear a lot. It did good with my mascara and left nothing behind.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Great product,"I love this cleanser. Especially when removing make up. 
The first time I ordered it had a jelly like consistency and the second time it was gel like. Doesn’t leave the skin feeling stripped."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Australia,love ❤️,This is working amazing on my face but the only negative is the smell it’s on the stronger side for my liking.                                                                                   
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,I love almost everything from biossance. But not this. I had removed my makeup with my usual makeup balm and then went in with this cleanser. I had to use it 3 times and still had some makeup left on my face.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,"Was not for me. I had been using a different biossance cleanser but wanted to give this one a shot. It feels nice, but I began to get emerging acne after switching to this. Not the biossance product for me."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,"Not my fave.. the texture of the one I bought was very different from the one I sampled in store. You really need to warm it up in your hands before applying to the face, otherwise it feels like trying to drag molasses across your skin. Didn't love the feel of it, though it emulsifies pretty well when rinsing it off with water. As a cleanser I feel like it just barely does the job, and I wouldn't repurchase. If you're like me and want to try all the different oil and balm cleanser options, you can do without this one."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Meh,"This may or may not have given me breakouts. Comes out in a gel-like texture, but becomes really thin and liquidy on the face."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,New Zealand,Nice & Light ,I do like the consistency it is very jelly like but I honestly can’t say I notice anything special happening to my skin using it so I may not purchase it again. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Returned this - not good to remove makeup.,"Gave it a fair shot but I just didn’t like it. I ended up returning it for a few reasons; 

Something about the packaging/product makes it hard to control how much comes out of the bottle, I always felt like I was getting so much but had to use it once it was out. It probably wouldn’t have even lasted me a month with daily washing.

Having said that, you do need to use more than you’d expect because it just kind of disappears on the face. It doesn’t lather or even work around on the skin, it feels like you need to add more mid wash to remove makeup because you can’t feel it anymore.  

Overall, might be okay for someone to just wash their face but I feel like you need to use too much of it and it’s not cheap."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,"It has jelly texture. Generally it is like face balm/oil feelings and you seems to use it as a first step, but you can also use as a second step in your pm routine. Make your face a little wet and apply with circulating motions. I do really believe that if your cleanser is non-comedogenic as this one you should have clearest skin✨"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Definitely Worth a Try,"I have sensitive skin and usually reside in the land of the cleanser merry go round . I loved this cleanser!! After reading the reviews I almost returned it. However, I decided to go for it after I researched the How to Use from the brand and found the key was adding WARM water to emulsify the product and then rinsing it off. It left my skin feeling soft and not irritated."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Australia,not too bad,"Can definitely get a product cheaper it doesn’t really remove my makeup I have to washy face twice for my makeup to be removed, smells not too bad but the oil cleanse they have is my go to"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Great hydrating cleanser,"I love this cleanser for occasional use, to clean sunscreen & city pollution from my skin and sometimes specifically as a beard cleanser.

I have normal to oily skin and this leaves both my skin and beard feeling super soft and hydrated. Girls, buy it for your man and have him wash his shorter length beard with this, you’ll love how soft it feels."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Australia,excellent for waterproof makeup,"Love this jelly cleanser - has a nice fresh berry smell and you can put it on with or without water.  it has a nice warming feeling when you first apply it

Takes off full coverage makeup effortlessly and cleanses without making your skin feel super dry and squeaky.  I haven't had any breakouts or skin irritation with this cleanser that I sometimes get with others

Definitely on the more expensive of the cleansing spectrum but I feel that it is worth the money"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Australia,amazing holy grail,"I love this cleanser, I got my first one 6 months ago and after daily use (mainly only at night time) I am only just running out so purchasing my second bottle. The smell is not overpowering and quite pleasant, it feels gentle yet effective and not drying for daily use (no make up). If I am wearing make-up or spf it is still effective, I would usually double Cleanse, and does not sting eyes especially when removing my waterproof mascara. I love it and also am a big fan of everything biossance!!!! <3"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Not a fave. I feel that it doesn’t take off my makeup well and I feel like it slips off my face. I will use this up and not repurchase.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Ehh,"I don’t love this product or really like this product. It works, I don’t love that it doesn’t lather, it feels thin and liquidy. Not the consistency I’m looking for. It also doesn’t leave my skin feeling super clean. Will not repurchase. Don’t really want to use it."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,"It works, but not my fave.","I use this when double cleansing and I follow with the Drunk Elephant jelly cleanser. It starts out super thick but it takes a lot of rubbing to melt down into an oil. I’m either rubbing it in so much it tugs my skin or I have to use more product than I’d like. It does eventually warm up and become oily though. It emulsifies fine. I’m not sure how well it removes makeup, as I don’t use any. May not repurchase since other cleansers take less product to do the same job."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,"A beauty advisor recommended this product to me, as i struggled with acne and had dry/oily skin. Honestly within the first week you can notice a difference, it reduced the appearance of my acne and kept my skin so hydrated. This product also goes really well with the farmacy deep sweep toner. Definitely going to have to repurchase, highly recommend if you have acne prone and combo skin!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,It’s a 5 star Balm not a jelly!,I love this product. I’m shocked it has 3 stars. This is like a balm turned into a thinner balm. It’s not a jelly cleaners. It removes makeup like green clean or take off the day BUT way better. So if you love creamy balms that turn to milk you will love this!!! I love It with my whole heart!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Gentle cleanser,"My favorite cleanser for morning and step one of a double cleanse. Never stripping, always gentle. A great way to use it is to massage it in right before your shower, then let the steam do its magic! Always out of stock on the biossance website so I’m so happy that Sephora carries it."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Can I rate this a negative number?,"It smelled terrible. It was during quarantine so I wasn’t wearing much makeup so I don’t know about
That aspect of it. I just know every time it got
Near my face I wanted to vomit. And I accidentally purchased two and I knew I couldn’t go through months of this smell. I don’t know if I got a bad batch. Definitely returning ASAP."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,LOVE IT BUT FALSE MARKETING,"This is a beautiful gentle fun cleanser that you can massage into your face endlessly. It’s just so soothing and leaves you feeling great. However, the color and consistency look absolutely nothing! I repeat nothing like the pictures. It’s a good thing I ended up liking this product because Biossance be shadyyyy with what they are presenting and what the product actually is. But like I said, it’s still really good. Just be honest about what the product is. Is that too much to ask for???"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,"I love that I can use this cleanser on wet or dry skin. It does a great job of cleaning and getting my makeup off. I do sometimes still use eye makeup remover, especially if I have waterproof mascara on, but otherwise, this definitely does the job without making my face feel dry."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Disappointing,This product didn’t remove makeup or make my face feel clean whatsoever. I had high hopes because I really liked the algae eye cream from Biossance but this was disappointing.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,"I prefer another cleanser of theirs that I got as a sample, but this makes washing off my makeup and washing my face super quick and easy."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,double cleanse with this,"I borderline hated this at first. i decided to give this cleanser a try after using the Boscia makeup breakup oil for years. You have to double cleanse with this at night in order to remove your makeup - once on dry skin and a small amount again on your wet face. It removes all of my waterproof mascara and makeup so i do like it for that. it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated afterwards. i removed 1 star because my eyes do sting a bit after, side note i wear contact lenses"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,hydrating!,I saw jadeywadey180 on YouTube use this in one of her facial videos and was intrigued by this cute pink cleanser so I decided to try. I really really like this. It’s hydrating so you don’t feel tight/stripped after using. It has a very slight scent I’m not that fond of but like I said it’s subtle so no big deal. It applies as a gel but turns milky when you add water. When I dry off my face feels comfortable and soft :) recommend!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,great for dry skin,"I use this as my second step cleanser after my oil cleanser, it washes off clean and doesn't dry out the skin. I love it for my very dry skin. The smell is kinda herbaly which I don't love but it doesn't linger on the skin. Overall happy with this product."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,"The cleanser smells good in my opinion and didn’t make my skin feel dry but it did not larger well, I would still have makeup when I dried my face on the towel. If it lathered better I would love it"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,It's not hot pink & I'm ok with that,I like this cleanser. It is gentle but I feel like it takes off my makeup at the end of the day. I like that it doesn't have a strong scent. It is not bright pink like is shown in the pictures.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Love this product! It is great for sensitive skin (like mine) and is greatly gentle. I would not recommend for anyone looking for a deeper cleanse as it is really light. It also does not remove heavy makeup super well (which I don’t wear makeup often so it is not an issue for me/for others who are the same)
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,I wanted to like it,"Of the biossance products I tried,  this one was a let down. It didn't remove makeup properly and has a weird texture on my face."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,IT DOESN'T REMOVE WATERPROOF MASCARA!!!,It's not true that it removes waterproof eye makeup.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,My skin is SO soft!,When I need to buy a 2nd before I've even finished the 1st I know it's a product I will continue to use. This is like that. The cleanser leaves my skin so soft it is incredible. I absolutely love a product that can improve skin texture and this has done that for me.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Holy Grail Cleanser,"I never write reviews but this product was worthy of one!  I have loved my Tula cleansing oil and have been on the hunt for a good cleanser, currently using kopari tropical and no complaints... BUT this new cleanser does it all and it’s the type of product that makes you look forward to cleaning your face!  You have to know the product and how to use it though.  It can be an oil like cleanser similar to the farmacy green clean to remove make up or a gel to foaming cleanser OR both!!! If you start with dry hands and dry face and warm it up and into skin and massage it breaks down the make up then if you add a splash of warm water and I use my PMD clean and wet it the formula turns a little foamy and leaves your feeling clean and not greasy or tight either, just clean and balanced.  This is such a great find and I’m so glad I tried it! I have yet to find a biossance product I didn’t love!  Also, it’s purple which just makes it a little more fun."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,STEP 1 CLEANSER,"I keep seeing reviews of everyone saying that this product doesn’t cleanse your skin. That is probably because you are applying it wrong, or you don’t use a secondary cleanser afterwards. I’ve never had an issue with this cleanser. I love the way you can put it on your skin in a balm form, then watch it melt away into a milky texture the second you add water. I find that this cleanser really gets the job done after a long day at work and it makes your skin feel really soft. I go in afterwards with the YTTP superfood cleanser and it is a great duo. This Biossance product also helps with removing makeup, I only sometimes wear it but it takes mascara right off."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,NOT GOOD ENOUGH,"smells okay, feels okay, but doesn't do anything for makeup removing or even for cleansing. it leaves this sort of greasy film on my skin, which i usually enjoy, but this cleanser leaves me feeling sticky rather than hydrated."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,"Bought this couple weeks ago, tried it and it works really good, smell isn’t great but it is all natural so that’s okay! But is kinda inconvenient to use bc you need to use it with dry skin first (for best results) so can’t use it in the shower. Also I felt I was using so much when I used it."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Use as Pre cleanse,"This is great as a pre cleanse to remove makeup. I don’t love it as the second step in my face washing routine. It’s a rich balm that melts into the skin and turns milky with water. As a second step, it’s too thick and doesn’t leave my skin feeling clean. I probably won’t repurchase as I have a pre cleanse that I prefer."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Great Cleanser! This cleanses and relieves my redness. Absolutely will repurchase.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Not pink,It reminds me of a cleansing balm. I was kinda sad the product isn’t pink.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,I like the way this cleanser leaves my face feeling hydrated afterwards. It helps to take the first layer of makeup off in the evening. Just make sure you wet your face before using so it glides more easily. The scent is really nice and the price is not bad either. Didn't had any breakout related to this product and it didn't iritate my skin.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,it’s good <3,"i like it! it’s thick, gooey, and very oily so it’s great for an oil cleanse. it removes sunscreen very well, but i must say.... it didn’t remove my eyeliner well. it took probably sixty seconds of gentle circular massaging just to break UP the eyeliner. and it wasn’t even waterproof. however, it did a great job with all my eye and face makeup. but it does not look like the photo... it was a more clear/peachy color and had little esters of oil in it, not that pretty elderberry jell color like the picture. it smells amazing also. it emulsified very well! i use it as a first cleanse and sometimes, if my skin is extra dry, a use it as my second cleanse as well bc i never get clogged pores. overall, it’s a good pricey as long as you don’t use heavy eyeliner! great price for what it is as well :D"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,This cleanser is marketed incorrectly. It’s a cleansing balm to be used as a first cleanse in a double cleanse. It’s not a gel consistency. It’s a balm that turning into an oil on dry skin.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,"Nice, but not like the pictures","This is a great gentle cleaner, it's softening and isn't stripping making it great for dry skin. HOWEVER, it looks nothing like the pictures. It's not that bright pink gel that the pictures make it look like, it's closer to being clear and has a thicker, more creamy texture than the pictures. I don't know if I got a weird batch or if it's truly unlike the images shown, but just know it's not as pretty or as gel-like as the images."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,More of a 1 step in double cleansing,"This is a cleansing balm before your actual cleanser. Its has a milky texture if you use water first if you aren't wearing makeup. Wish it was marketed better as a makeup remover balm than a cleanser as majority of people like myself didn't have a clear understanding, but I will learn to read more about a product than word of mouth. Probably need to an additional product as this is a 1 out of 2 steps. Wish they would have made a product that complimented which made it worth the purchase. Not a bad product just not something I needed. It does the job though"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Biossance Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,I don’t find it effective at all. I don’t wear foundation and only use a little mascara (not waterproof) and it doesn’t even get that off and leaves a residue... not sure why it claims to be a cleanser or makeup remover as it doesn’t do either for me.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,New Favorite Cleanser,"Disclaimer- I’ve never used a jelly cleanser before, so I can’t compare this one to any other. Also- I wear a tinted oil based foundation, sunscreen, and brow pomade, and that’s it, so I can’t speak to its effectiveness for removing heavy makeup. 

That being said, I love this! It takes some getting used to, but I love how my skin looks and feels since I switched to this! I rub it in my hands to warm/melt it, then rub it all over my face before I hop into the shower. It rinses off easily and doesn’t leave any residue or film. My skin looks balanced- not dry, not at all greasy, just ready for my AM/PM skincare routine. This has definitely replaced my old cleanser and I will definitely repurchase this!!!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Sensitive skin saver,"Bought this because my skin became much more sensitive with pregnancy. Too sensitive to use most make up or skin products without breaking out.  Cleanser is working great so far - no stripping, no breakouts. Face feels refreshed and hydrated after using. Looking forward to using this through pregnancy and beyond!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Amazing Cleanser,Omg this cleanser is amazing!!! I have no idea why people say it smells bad because I love the smell. It is not a cleansing balm so not sure why other people are saying it is. If you have dry skin then this is the best one I’ve found. I have purchased six of these !!! Love it
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Elderberry Jelly Cleanser,USA,Not worth the hype,"I’m usually so obsessed with Biossance products and own almost all of them, so I’m really disappointed in how this works for me. It’s wonderful on the face and removing that makeup, but it hardly removes eye makeup. I don’t wear waterproof or anything, and it still barely budged. My cleansing oil removes no problem so I’ll be sticking with that."
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Australia,Good basic cream cleanser,"Good basic cream cleanser, wasn't too stripping"
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Singapore,rose,"This rich, creamy cleanser does a stellar job of breaking down eyeliner and mascara — and even cleansing post-laser treatment skin — without causing any residual redness or discomfort."
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,New Zealand,Would Def buy again,so gentle and smells delish ! I am also a sucker for pretty packaging ! my skin feels soft and refreshed after cleansing and it's last for a good while too ! 
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Singapore,Basic,"I personally so not like the smell of this cleanser. Faint smell of rose, but more of mud. Does the job of cleansing, nothing special about it that I note. A normal try for me I would say."
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Singapore,PIXI ROSE CREAM CLEANSER,does not have rose scent at all.   does not really cleanse well still leave film of makeup on.  Still need to double cleanse after using this.  Will not repurchase.   not worth the price.   
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Australia,best ever!,"This is the best cleanser you will ever buy! Loving the scent. It doesn’t dry your skin out  and leaves it feeling moisturised and fresh. I can never buy it, its always sold out.                 "
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Australia,It's ok.,"When it comes to skincare, you're better off buying something that you know is going to work, for the price, it is very basic. Seek more cosmeceuticals instead."
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Singapore,Not a pleasant experience ,"After washing my face with this cleanser I always doubt if my skin is clean enough. I felt that it leaves a film of oil behind, not sure if others felt the same. It doesn’t foam much or lather up so I end up using 3x more of what I’d use to wash my face with other cleanser. "
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Singapore,Awful!,"I don’t know what this is!  The clay in it is too pungent, it doesn’t even foam, it’s just mud on the face and it doesn’t even clean, it just deposits a slimy feeling on my skin!  I’d rate it a negative if I could!  And I don’t know how it can be called comfort cleanser, I was cringing and trying not to gag when I use it.  I’m sticking to my Fresh soy face cleanser even if it’s slightly more expensive.  At this rate, I’m mixing it with strong scented body wash just to be able to use it at all!  Don’t waste your money! 👎"
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Malaysia,Pixi Rose Cream Cleaner,"Love this cleanser! I have dry skin and sensitive skin, this cleanser actually one of the first cleanser which didn’t give me any allergic reaction so far. I think it hydrates my skin since I rarely see those flaky dry skin mark on my face. "
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Singapore,Gentle and comforting,"This is the cleanser for when you need some TLC. The rose scent and creamy texture comforts skin and leaves you with soft, clean skin. Don’t notice any particular benefits but good for everyday use."
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Singapore,does the job ,Really mild creamy cleanser . I like the scent and how it’s hydrating for the skin . However there are other better hydrating face wash out there . Suitable to be used with cleansing devices 
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Singapore,NTA,"Used this during a time I couldn’t find my usual routine cleanser due to the pandemic and no availability and not impressed.
It’s very light and I prefer something that can help me take the makeup off as well. Smell was nice though "
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Malaysia,Love it! ,"Always a fan of Pixi. Love this because it comes w a big tube. Your other half might even love sharing it w you. It doesn’t dry up the skin, yet it makes your skin squeaky clean. Helps to clear make up residue as well. Love it even more w the mild scent, not the strong artificial one. 3rd tube already! "
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Australia,Soothing,"This cleanser is very gentle for my sensitive rosacea-prone skin. It removes make up and impurities easily, while still leaving my skin moisturised. There is also no film or residue left on my skin."
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,New Zealand,gentle facial cleanser ,"I love the smell of this rose cream cleanser. Very gentle facial cleanser, doesn’t foaming that well though. I use it at morning when my face is not too oily. Feel refresh after using it. "
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Singapore,Best cleanser everrrrrrrr,The cleanser has a mild rose scent but definitely works well for me. It takes off all the grime without striping my face harshly. You can feel that your skin is plump and hydrated after the wash!
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Singapore,Pretty packaging ,"Pretty shade of pink for the packaging! I have normal/combi skin and this cleanser works well. Its not drying for my skin but at same time, nothing noticeable for me to repurchase again. Will try out other brands"
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Singapore,pixi rose cream cleanser,"at first thought it was not effective, after i kept using it my face got better and better however if u have sensitive skin, you might not like it as it is abit tingly "
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Malaysia,Average Cleanser,My skin is a combination of oily t-zone and dry at the cheeks and jaw area. I think it worked as a normal cleanser. Cleans the face without drying the skin which is good when my skin is angry and sensitive.
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Singapore,cream cleanser,This is very hydrating and not dry for the skin! It smells comfortable too. Not drying and difficult to wash off. I really love it! There is slight rose smell too. Not strong and sickening. 
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Australia,Pixi rose cream cleanser.,"Oven only been using this product for a week or so but I like it so far. The packaging is a little cheap but the product has a subtle scent, is smooth and has a gentle cleansing formula. I use it in the shower and take a moment to give my face and neck a massage before rinsing. I’m prone to rosecea and find this cleanser gentle."
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Malaysia,Ok product,"The formula is a little too thick for my liking. It’s not a bad product as it’s suitable for dry skin. It’s also affordable. But I don’t like the packaging as by the end of the product, you have to squeeze the tube out. Tube packaging is always very wasteful. Won’t repurchase. "
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Australia,Smells good and doesn’t dry out your face,It smells nice and cleans face without drying it. Texture is thick but doesn’t feel creamy enough. I think it’s a decent one. Will update the review after using it for few more days.
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,Malaysia,Good for sensitive skin,"It's a good product f you're having acne or sensitive skin but I personally don't like the smell. it is non foamy if you are okay with that. Yes, it works."
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,cleanser,"just a plain cleanser, not suitable for me bacause it did not cleanse very well for makeup user and acne prone skin, mayb suitable for people who doesnt wear makeup. "
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,gentle on my skin,"This cleanser is gentle on my skin. Doesn’t strip out. After washing my face i like to check out my face and this does what it says, has a certain glow aft using. Goes well with my skincare routine too! I really love the smell somehow hahaha "
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,Pixi Rose Cream Cleanser PIXI  Rose Cream Cleanser,"Love this product. It gives my skin a glow kind of look after using it. The smell is simply awakening, especially in the morning. It makes me feel good. Will definitely repurchase it. "
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,Didn't fancy it. ,I have combination skin and didn't fancy this face wash at all. I used it for 1 week and gave it away. The creamy consistency is weird. It doesn't do much cleansing.
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,feels good on the skin ,"I barely use this but when I do, I my skin feels great after. I barely use this but when I do, I my skin feels great after I barely use this but when I do, I my skin feels great after I barely use this but when I do, I my skin feels great after 
"
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,Rosy rose,"My second time to purchase! Really love the smell and the effect effect after several use. Must use with the rose toner and cream. 

Skin type: oily to dry skin"
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,not impressive,"bought and stopped using after a few times.. feels no difference.. wouldn't make a second purchase.. other brands of cleanser feels clean after wash but this, I feel no effect.."
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,Pixi Rose Cleanser,"Bought this after viewing a youtuber’s review... very gentle face cleanser to use in the morning... if you do not like those cleanser that leave a layer of stuff on your face, then you won’t like this."
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,Pixi Rose Cream Cleanser,I bought it based on the recommendations of skincare guru- Caroline Hirons and i don't regret the purchase.. The price is reasonable for any other similar products and the rosy scent it gives off is fantastic..
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,i love this!!,i have dry skin so most cleansers leave my skin dry & tight. this is a very gentle cream-like  consistency cleanser that didn't dry out my skin but left it feeling hydrated instead. affordable for such a big tube too. love!! 
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,amazing ,Skin feels so soft and moisturized after using this product. Really decent size for the $$. Will purchase again. Keen to try more products in this brand.
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,2nd purchase!,i love this cleanser! it was a mild cleanser good for my sensitive skin. i had less breakout too after using this. my face feels a bit smoother as well
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,Gentle cleanser,My skin is really prone to drying out and I've been on long search for a gentle cleanser which wouldn't leave my skin parched. Really happy to say this is it! Lovely smell too.
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,Feels kind of oily ,Bought it because it was a lot cheaper than other cleansers. I don’t really like because it feels rather oily and doesn’t give you the after fresh and clean feeling. Probably better for those who are more interested in milk based or less intrusive cleansers
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,It is just ok,Perhaps this is just normal cleanser. I am rating it just ok... Coz i didnt feel any changes es to my skin. But still its functional as a cleanser.overall is ok. 
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,Fresh flowers,"i've been using this for a couple of weeks now. i like that it have that rosey scent more like the flower and not the fragrant. it is a mild cream cleanser, which leave my skin feeling fresh and soft. but no sure if theres any changes in my skin so far"
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,"Non-Drying,  Effective Cleanser","This is my second purchase, the first was part of a Pixi Rose Christmas set. This mud cleanser also moisturises. 
1. Removes make-up including eye make-up
2. non-soap/non-foaming - I like it cos it feels less drying
3. smells natural 
4. Good value for money - one tube lasts about 5 months, used twice a day. 
5. spend a bit of time with it - two minutes gently massaging your face makes you feel good, and your face will be glowing after 
love it. "
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,stung my sensitive skin,This product is heavily scented and has a cream texture. It is rather stripping and stung my sensitive rosacea-prone skin. I would not recommend for those of you with sensitive skin or dry skin.
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,holy grail,"Perfect for dry skin. My skin are very very dry & when i started using this, i dun feel any dryness on my face. Price is affordable & doesnt cost me a bomb on skincare product. Definitely will repurchase. "
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,gentle & moisturising,"Smells good, very gentle cleanser thats non foaming so I don’t feel my skin tight & dry after using like normal foam cleanser does. But it felt like washing your skin with lotion rather than a cleanser as it doesn’t foam up, lotion cream like texture. "
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,best cleanser!!,Totally in love with this pick rose cream cleanser! My first ever pixi product and am so in love with it. The rose smell isn’t as strong as I thought it’d be. Makes my face feel so much fresher after using it and my face is less oily 
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,best cleanser ever used,"ever since I used this cleanser, my skin has been feeling and looking very clean compared to other korean cleansers I've used previously. more suitable for oily skin as it is slightly acidic."
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,new,Tried the mud cleanser from pixi and thought it was not bad however I really like their rose line products so decided to try this instead of repurchasing. 
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,Hello radiant skin!,Bought this for my friend to test it out when she needed a new cleanser and I could see the diff on her skin! She's POPPIN' and GLOWIN'. I'm all for Pixi being cruelty free whilst being a superb skincare brand.
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,Disappointing ,"If your skincare routine consists of only cleanser, toner then moisturiser, then this product may let you down. This is not a cleanser that can be used by itself as it leaves no visible improvements on the skin. The only time it left my skin feeling kind of smooth was when I used an exfoliator before! Will not be repurchasing. "
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,Best cleanser I've used,"This is by far the best cleanser I've used. I always stick to cream cleansers as I have dry skin and they seem the most suitable. This one has the most heavenly scent, and leaves  my skin so soft and clean. I use it with the Pixi GLow Tonic and together they are just amazing. I have sensitive skin and this has been perfect for it. So glad I bought this and would definitely buy again."
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,Great,This is the best product I have ever tried before!!It does not like the other products which would make my face dryer and broke me up.Kuso Pixi!!Pixi never disappoints me with the generous ingredients and benefits to me but the only weakness is the cleanser contains paraben.
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,love it,"Got oily and dry skin, congested pores. it was a struggle to find a cleanser which cleanse yet doesnt make my skin dry. This makes my skin feel hydrated withought the tight feeling.  It doesnt foam though. If you like the squeeky clean feel, this might not be your thing. "
PIXI-Rose Cream Cleanser,,Made my skin feel good!,"I love love it!! I have a very dry skin. And I saw this Pixi Rose Cream Cleanser may be good for my dry skin. Diggin' the texture as it is like an organic clay cleanser making my skin feel soft, moistured and deeply cleansed. Scent wise is not as I was expected as it says rose cream but it doesn't smell like rose at all, more of a clay smell (not strong). Overall, I think it's worth getting it as the size is reasonable for that price. Definitely, repurchase it once it's finsihed! <3 😊"
CAUDALIE-Skincare Bestie Box,Singapore,Gentle and natural,"Has been using this for years, so far is the most suitable skin care for those sensitive skin. Combination of their best product for dry skin without grease and sticky feeling"
CAUDALIE-Skincare Bestie Box,Singapore,Bestie Box,Bestie Box can be used for trial kit. The products are small for travelling. Not all the products are suitable for me as they do not offer the effects they stated. 
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,am/pm reset,"I pat this on my face morning and night after cleansing (which is why I wish it weren't as pricey as it is). It helps restore my skin's pH immediately and feels so refreshing on my face and neck. If someone could recommend a cheaper option, I may consider switching. I don't know for how much longer I can keep justifying the price... I usually can for products at this price point that last me 9 months+, but this one is maybe 4 or 5 months for how often I use it."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,Singapore,Love it 🫶,"I love Origins skin Care set . I will buy every month per one …… I’m the combination skin it is very good to use . I try lotion, serum, emulsion, face mask."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,"I've been using this product for over a year and I love it. I have very sensitive skin that is quick to flush and quick to breakout. I'm bad at sticking to a routine but this product is so easy to use every single day. I apply every morning with LastObject re-usable cotton rounds  - hydrating, calms my redness, and completely eliminated the textured bumps that I'd been struggling with on my forehead and chin."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,purchased multiple times,"Nice morning cleanse. Not really a great makeup remover, but I’m a double cleanser for make up removal since 20’s (and dinosaurs roamed the earth). Good no makeup day I’m too tired and it’s toothbrush and micellar and moisturizer and bed."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,Singapore,my daily essential,Very calming toner for my eczemtic skin. I have been using it every day for years!
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,Singapore,love it ,"I love this micellar water so much.. Never make my skin dry and feels so clean, fresh and hydrated. And for me the ingredients is very important and all the ingredients is good"
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,Cleanses gently and doesn’t leave my face feeling sticky like other micellar cleansers tend to
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,"I've tried using it to remove makeup. I would say it's not the best makeup remover, since you have to use a decent amount to clean. BUT! I used it after face wash and the outcome is amazing! It leaves my face feeling so clean, and I only needed a minimum amount. Then I follow it with my skincare routine."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,ok at best,"I would not recommend using this to take eye makeup off, if it gets in your eyes it stings and after works my eyes feel like they’ve been dragged through mud and my skin feels raw. I’ve instead been using sort of like a toner after cleansing my face and it seems okay that way. There’s no special aspects. No strong smell. It’s OKAY at best, I wouldn’t buy this again however. I have sensitive skin and it doesn’t seem to irritate it unless I use it to remove eye makeup."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Don’t waste the money,This like the lotion is water. I had to pour 3 handfuls to only get a fraction of clean. It states it’s creamy and it isn’t at all. Did not wash makeup off at all
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,It’s okay...,"I’ve been using this product for a couple weeks and it hasn’t broken me out or otherwise irritated my skin. Another plus is I can’t detect a strong scent and it has no residue. Having said that it’s not really that effective at removing eye makeup, which is primarily why I bought it. Keep in mind I use a cleansing balm on all my face and just use this as a last step since I do use a couple layers of mascara. But it takes multiple swipes to get most of it off. At this price point I was looking for something more effective so I’ll probably keep looking once I use up the bottle for something more effective."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,Canada,I love it!,"Amazing product, ive tried and different micellars and cleansing oils but I keep coming back to this because my skin loves it!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,"It’s like magic, but real.",I use this on a cotton pad between cleansing and moisturizing. I let it soak into my skin a bit before applying the rest of my skin care. This works best for me overnight. I will wake up with no redness. I use it in the morning depending whether or not I have some red spots.
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,excellent quality,"This is a great cleanser; it doesn’t leave skin feeling stripped or dry. I don’t use it as a makeup remover. I use it in the morning as a morning cleanse with toner and serums afterwards. I jump around between brands and this is definitely up at the top. Great scent, great feel, removes dirt that I can see on my cloth pads."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,for combination/textured skin,I was skeptical because I never use micellar water but it is super refreshing! I have been using it midday on my bare face to remove oil since I’m not wearing make up as much and love it. It does remove most make up but I also use an oil cleanser so I am able to get the rest of my make up off with that.
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,A summer must have! I would use this to wipe off my face at work throughout the day it felt great and kept the oil at bay. Very gentle and didn’t cause me to break out.

ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,Canada,Green Dream,"If you’re new to micellar water, go elsewhere. Otherwise you risk enjoying other micellar waters, the majority of which can’t hold a candle—or a cleanse— to this extraordinary cleanser/toner/love child-miracle. After using Origins watery dream, all other waters will feel less... watery (?!) somehow. And definitely less dreamy. My apologies to the many micellar waters out there, but it’s the truth. Which has been known to hurt. This emerald-coloured micellar water is a gem and, in my experience, as good as it gets. Face cleansing water-wise."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,INCREDIBLE EVEN FOR SENSITIVE SKIN!!!,AMAZING PRODUCT!!! I love this micelles cleanser soooo much. I have very sensitive skin and this does NOT negatively impact my skin at all. It is very hydrating and easy to use.
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,Canada,Best way to remover makeup,"I usually use a cleansing balm to remove my makeup then I use this product to make sure their is no makeup left over on my skin and let me tell you this product is amazing. It makes sure that your face has no more remaining makeup on it. It smells great , it feels great, it’s super gentle on your skin especially if you have sensitive skin and it certainly won’t break you out."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Makes my Skin Feel Clean!,"I use this as a toner after washing my face. It really does get any traces of makeup off your face. Even though it is marketed as a ""micellar cleanser"" it really makes an excellent toner in that it makes my face feel clean but not stripped. I totally stocked up on this during the Spring Sale."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Skip the face wash!,"This is the first micellar water cleanser I've tried, but I cant imagine switching to another! The cost is on the expensive side- it's worth it! I don't wash my face with soap anymore unless I have makeup on. I noticed the difference in my skin right away. Dark spots continue to fade and my skin is'nt nearly as dry anymore. I use The Ordinary products afterwards. This is the first time in a long time I'm starting to like my skin."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,"Excellent toner. Leave skin clean, moisturized and smells nice. I love Origins, great products good prices"

Even though it's not a normal cleanser, it still takes off my makeup and leaves my face feeling clean. A wonderful product if you're not great about washing your face AM or PM."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,my favourite,"Literally cannot live without this product! I am a pro model and I take a lot of pride in my skin.  There are times when my skin becomes irritated and this takes it away.  Especially good when you don’t have any milk handy for skin irritations. I’m amazed at how much makeup, dirty and other environmental pollutants show up on the cotton pads after the first initial makeup removal. It literally takes everything away and leaves your skin so soft and lets it breathe.  It comes with me to every shoot, I even have a back up one for in my purse."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,Canada,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,Great for sensitive skin. Cleans well! No redness or itching after use.
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,,Opinion,"The only downside of this product is it is quite expensive for a make up remover as drug store has cheaper version. However, i love the smell of it, and the calming effect it brings to my skin. Just note that, it might take a while to take off mascara and eyeliner."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,LOVE,I love this micellar water more than I thought that I would... I love they way it makes my skin feel after cleansing! I feel that this has made such a difference in the texture and the complexion of my skin after just 2 weeks of using. DOUBLE CLEANSING is a must for me so I am hooked!! The only downside is that I am unable to use on my eyes :(
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Tests on animals,"Best micellar water I've used so far.  Doesn't leave any residue or film.  Smells nice.  Doesn't irritate my eyes.  Leaves skin soft and smooth, and most of all cleans skin very well.  The only issue I have with it is that it testS on animals according to PETA."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,Love love love this cleanser! No residue and it doesn’t irritate my eyes at all
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,holy grail product!,"This is one of my holy grail products. I started incorporating micellar water into my routine, just one I bought from the drugstore, but after reading up on some of the ingredients I wanted to switch to a cleaner product. I tried Caudalie, I love a lot of their products but it left my skin with a weird tacky residue...I returned and tried this and it’s amazing! No residue, just give a minute to fully dry before doing the next step in your routine. It does an excellent job cleansing, I often use it on it’s own instead of double cleansing, and I have oily skin!! And it fully cleans my skin, not as great for removing a full face of makeup- not because it doesn’t do the job, but you need several cotton pads to get everything off, and it’s a little pricey for the amount you get so I only use for light makeup days."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,love/tears,"on my third bottle of this. I love it, it leaves my skin feeling calm and amazing after cleansing. I alternate between this and the fresh rose toner depending on how my skin feels. I use this when my skin needs more cleansing or toning and that when i need more hydration. my only problem with this product is the price for how quickly you go through it because it's a liquid. it becomes one of the more expensive items in an arsenal of luxury products because I need 3 bottles a year while still alternating with another product. but I still buy it so take from this what you will"
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,Perfect for sensitive skin. Use it twice a day and makes skin look great!
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this! I’ve tried other micellar waters in the past and they haven’t worked very well for me. When I got a sample of this I wasn’t expecting much, but I gave it a try anyway. Just a little bit of this stuff on a micro fiber wash cloth took off a FULL FACE of makeup. Full foundation, eye makeup, lipstick, EVERYTHING. It also didn’t leave a weird feeling residue on my skin like some products do. My face feels nice and clean after using this! Definitely adding this to my wish list!"

ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,AMAZING...try it for a week!,"Originally when I bought this I thought my face was breaking out, but after just three days it all went away and took all my redness away with it! I like to use it in the morning only to take away all the oil I’ve gotten overnight and it’s the perfect light cleanser in the morning. It isn’t make away too much moister and perfectly sets me up for my make up routine after!!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,beware,I used about half of the bottle over a period of about 3 weeks before I realized this product was causing my skin more redness and an overload of tiny bumps across my forehead. Most of the time “clean” products are good to my skin but this cleanser made my skin worse.
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,It made me breakout. I didn’t even realize it was this product causing it. Stopped using it for a few weeks and then when I resumed my skin flared back up again. Really disappointed because I’ve tried several micellar waters and none have cause breakouts.
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,Residue!! I have used several micellar cleansers and this one leaves way more residue than any other. Not a fan for my sensitive breakout prone skin.
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,love! a must have in my nightly beauty routine!,"so much better than drug store stuff! i love how it feels on my skin, how well it works to remove make up and the general grime that lands on my skin during the day. i have pretty sensitive/dry skin, and this didn't irritate it or dry it out. and i love the smell! thank you origins!!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,GREAT FOR DRY/SENSITIVE SKIN,This is a GREAT micellar cleanser!! I have very dry/sensitive skin...and this works without drying out my skin (like other micellar waters) I like the smell too. I use this after I wash my face at night to make sure I get all eye and makeup off. Then I use it in the morning before applying makeup/lotion (to save time instead of washing my face)  TIP: I do use the Shiseido facial cotton pads. It doesn't take as much of the product as regular cotton pads. You get about 160 pads for $12 on Sephora. Money well spent. And these pads also don't leave cotton hairs all over your face!!  The whole Mega-Mushroom line is great for dry/sensitive/red skin. I highly recommend.
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,I use this as my “second cleanser “ and use it almost like a toner every night and it just refreshes my skin ! I wish it was a little cheaper because I have gone through 4 bottles but with how much my skin loves it! it’s worth it ❤️
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,"This micellar cleansing water is pretty good. I like to use it in the mornings because it's quick, gentle, and efficient. It is great for dry and sensitive skin though I think it's suitable for all skin types. Even though it's pretty good, I won't be repurchasing because I don't think it's much different than any other micellar water that I can get for less money."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,,Nothing special,"Just so-so as a cleanser. Leaves my skin feeling very hydrated and supple, but also tends to break my acne-prone skin out if I use it too often. Might work better with drier skin types. Don’t really think it’s worth the price tag as there are cheaper micellar water products available that work just as well."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,amazing product for sensitive skin!,"I have very sensitive/oily skin and this product has worked wonders. Any redness will immediately subside once I have applied this and it smells so, so good!!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,As good as water.,I'v been using this for a few months now and it's a great cleanser but I'm not sure it does much more than water on a cotton ball swiping up the last few bits of makeup.
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Love love love,"I saw a review on this and was intrigued. I must say, it's actually worth the hype. I usually use a cream to remove my makeup and it visibly does a great job. Then I run a little bit of this after and OMG, the amount of makeup it removes is insane. Even on days when I don't put makeup and just put sunscreen, by the end of the day, when I wipe my face with this and oh la la does a lot of stuff come out. This is definitely becoming a staple in my evening routine."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,AMAZING PRODUCT,I have added this to my skincare routine along with origins toner and moisturizer . My acne has gotten so much better it is unbelievable. I have been struggling with acne for about 7-8 years which also means I have tried literally every medication and cream. Nothing worked but this. I’m so glad I was introduced to this by a close friend of mine. My skin feels baby smooth and I can also see my scars now starting to diminish
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,,"Does its job, it an expensive way","It is quite expensive for a make up remover, however it's made by natural and great ingredient just like any other Dr. Weils products hence the crazy price-tag. It removes make-up, dirt and debris and does not leave a filmy residue or leave my skin tight and dry like most Micellar cleansers. Doubt i will replenish again, as there are similar options out there will much lower price point."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,"This is a good daily cleanser, but not a good make up remover. I use it twice daily, at the end after my make up remover and in the morning to cleanse and add a bit of moisture. It is smooth, feels great on my skin and not only doesn't strip moisture, adds some back. I don't know if it is better than cheaper options, but I really like it."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,,Ms,"Nice cellular water. But wouldnt purchase again because its more expensive than other brand,will consider their original skin mosturizer or the coffee one  since my face is combination"
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Smells lovely,"Good micellar water, nothing special. It does smell really nice, really clean and like lavender. It does leave my face feeling ever so slightly sticky afterwards."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Wonderful cleansing water!,"This feels amazing on the skin, I use this after working out to ensure I don't break out if I can't wash my face right away. Smells lovely and feels very cleansing yet gentle, love it!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Miracle in a bottle,This product is by far the best cleanser ever! It's so simple and easy to use and gives flawless results. It made my skin feel super soft and removed more makeup that was left in my skin even after I already washed my face. I use this product morning and night and I will never go back to anything else!
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Worth every penny.,"I was recommended this product by a sephora employee. I originally used Marcelle makeup wipes from the drugstore to remove my makeup but was finding it too harsh even though it was for sensitive skin. After trying this stuff one time, it is AMAZING. The smell is like being at a spa and it feels so nice on the skin. I’m usually very sensitive but this doesn’t irritate at all. The lavender is also relaxing before bed. I have it 4 stars and not 5 because although worth every penny, it is still quite pricey. Also, in the morning I was told you could wipe your fresh face with this to refresh and don’t bees to use cleanser before applying my morning makeup but I felt I still needed to cleanse instead in the morning as I get oily when I sleep. 

BUY THIS STUFF. ITS WORTH IT!!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,I'm a fan!,"Love, love, love this cleanser. I use it alone or after my face wash. It always makes my face feel super clean and I really like the smell; very soothing.

ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,I have tried a ton of mice cleansers and this is one of my favorites.

ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Great Product,This works great. I had a breakout coming on and one swipe of this stopped it. Hard to believe but no breakout happened. My daughter is plagues with acne skin and one application a day is toning it down.

ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,"cooling and soothings. smells wonderful. Doesn't bother my eyes or skin. You need to moisturize afterwards, because it leaves your skin squeaky clean. I find the cleanser better on mascara and eyeshadow than on eyeliner (crayon). Anything with oil content you still need to use some sort of oil to remove. Really good for any eyeshadow or mascara fallout, because it doesn't disrupt any of the other makeup."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,A great cleanser!,The best product for someone with skin that is sensitive and red. It is so calming and nourishing. The only thing is it gets used up quite fast and its quite expensive to be replacing every couple weeks.

ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,,Not Too Good,Not too useful to me.... i prefer a RM20 skin care more than this one cause of my habits... i usually use two cotton pat to clean all my make up(it means twice) so i will not prefer this kind of products(too expensive to waste it T.T

It removes make up thoroughly while also reducing redness and soothing my sensitive skin!!!! My skin feels so calm and balanced after using this. I've already gone through like 10 bottles - seriously it's that good. So gentle, so effective. Perfect for all skin types, especially for those who are sensitive, dry, combination, acne-prone, have rosacea, eczema, or allergies. I use it as a regular face wash too and it's perfect for that as well. Highly recommend."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,IT WAS OKAY,"It was nothing special it was okay but not great. I've used drugstore priced micellar waters that have done a better job. On a day to day basis I don't wear heavy or a full face of makeup just cc cream and lipstick and maybe some blush. With this you will need to use about 2 to 3 cotton pads just to get rid of all your face makeup. I feel the description for this should be more of a hydrating, soothing face mist."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,LAZY SOME NIGHTS?! YOU’LL THANK ME LATER.,I tend to be lazy 5/7 nights a week. I skip everything & just cleanse my face with this micellar toner. it’s the best because you just put it on a pad to wipe your face & DONE! you don’t have to wash this cleanser-toner off. heaven in a bottle. also helps me greatly with my acne prone-combination skin.
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,LOVE,I use this water every morning before putting my face on. It feels so refreshing and has such a relaxing smell.
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,A new favourite!,"For context, I have skin that is really dry (seriously flakes off throughout the day when the weather gets colder, it's horrible) and red. I have had to search all over for products, especially moisturizers, that don't irritate my skin even more. This has quickly become my absolute favourite thing I put on my face, hands down. It has made a huge difference to reduce inflammation and dryness (when combined with my usual moisturizer) on my face; so much so that I've been opting for just under eye concealer instead of a full face of foundation to try and hide my skin. The smell is also amazing; it is fresh, clean, energizing, and makes me look forward to putting it on twice a day. I will definitely be repurchasing, and with such a large bottle of product the price is totally worth it!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Love love love!!!,I have such sensitive eczema prone skin and this is the most gentle waterless cleanser ever! It feels so nice on my skin and removes make up really well also.. so happy I bought it!
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,My HG Awesome Cleanser!!!!!,"Love love love this stuff!!!  I've tried several different micellar water cleansers, after I was introduced to them by a salesperson at Ulta.  That salesperson highly recommended THIS particular one, so I bought it.  Figured I'd give it a try, but I didn't have really high expectations.  I mean, how could some WATER by itself remove makeup (including mascara) and dirt and grime and oil better than a ""regular"" cleanser, right?  Well, guess what?  It does!!  This stuff is fantastic.  My skin has never felt so clean as it does after I use this on the Shiseido cotton page and wipe it all over my face, usually 2-3 times, JUST to make sure all traces of everything are removed.  Wow.  I was impressed the first time I used it and I'm still impressed.  It's now my HG product!  Thankfully Sephora also carries it so that I can purchase from them.  Is it expensive for what it does?  Yes, probably.  And I do go through it rather quickly.  But OMG.  To me, it's well worth the price.  All the other too micellar cleansers don't even compare to this one.  I'll be a sad sad girl if this is ever discontinued.  Might leave your skin just a tad on the dry side after cleansing with it.  Nothing that your regular skin care regimen can't take care of (serum? moisturizer?).  I'm hooked on this.  Wish I could buy it in bulk.  I hate to leave such a glowing review for fear that it will be out of stock when I need it next!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Nice,"I was recommended this by an employee after I mentioned I remove makeup with wipes, and she suggested trying this out since it's no rinse. So that's how I use it, after wiping the majority of my makeup with wipes, I use this on cotton pads to remove the remainder, and trust me there's always more, kind of scary that I was sleeping with left over gunk on my face. After using this, my face feels refreshed and clean, there is no need to rinse or towel dry. I haven't tried many micellar waters, but so far this is my favourite."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,"SO clean, no dryness, has balanced my skin","I see some reviewers have reported breakouts with this cleanser, but my experience with the Origins MMSRelief has been just the opposite. 

This cleanser has been miraculous for balancing my moody combination skin. It gets everything squeaky clean and fresh WITHOUT feeling tight and dry (it is weirdly satisfying to see all the grime that comes off on a cotton pad after a few swipes of this). There is no scent or anything irritating at all about it.

It leaves me feeling dewy and fresh without needing to wash, which is AWESOME after the gym, or if you hit snooze a few too many times and need to get ready quick! I also love that it's replaced my dependence on facial wipes (which get pricey and, let's face it, are pretty terrible for the planet). 

It's gentle enough to use under your eyes, and though it certainly won't cut through waterproof liners and mascaras like an actual eye makeup remover, it'll sweep away any left over shadowy residue just fine. 

You get a generous sized bottle of this, and since just a little bit will do, it should last you a long time. 

I feel like this would be an incredible cleanser for dry or older skin bc of its lack of drying. I love it for my own oily/dry combination skin, and I personally haven't had ANY breakouts at all in the month I've used it, so give it a shot if you hate drying cleansers."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,The Good & The Bad...,"I use this after using my regular cleanser - I'm just not that trusting of a no-rinse cleanser replacing my typical wash & dry routine.

The good - I use this after using my regular cleanser, and even though I feel like the cleanser does a thorough job of taking off my makeup (...umm, cleaning), I ALWAYS find residue on the cotton pads I use this one! So it's like a safety net of sorts.. it'll grab whatever is left over. 

That said, my face has been breaking out non-stop. I even got in a panic and did a fair amount of Googling adult acne because of all the whiteheads I've had breaking out on my forehead. When I stopped using this, they went away. 

And I understand that sometimes new products will draw out all the ""bad"" in the skin, but I gave it a few weeks to cycle through this, and still it caused a lot of problems."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,This product has cleared up my skin. Doesn't't make it tight & dry. In absolute love!
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Hate mushrooms...LOVE this,"I've used all sorts of toners over the years.  Somewhat recently tried Bioderma and used a large bottle of that.  Saw Lisa Eldridge mention this and thought I'd give it a shot.  It is more expensive by volume, but I like this more than Bioderma.  Does not irritate my sensitive combo skin at all.  Very light scent that isn't irritating.  Cleans my skin well after I wash.  And importantly, leaves my skin feeling softer than before.  There is NO drying even though this is a water-based product.  I've used one bottle and about to start my second."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,sensitive skin,I have sensitive skin that sometimes gets irritated and red and blotchy. I find this product to be anti-inflammatory and really calms my skin down. I love it.
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Great product for sensitive skin!,I definitely recommend this to people who have acne prone skin or sensitive skin. My friend has acne prone skin and she always repurchases this. I have sensitive skin in winter and I absolutely love this! This is hydrating and refreshing even in winter!
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Wasn't Great,Purchased this after being referred to it by a staff member. I was looking for something to take my makeup off with and to also wash my face with in between yoga and home. I found it felt oily and left my skin really dry.
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Almost 5 stars good,"Okay.. I wasn't sure I liked this when I bought it.  I actually didn't realize what this product was.  It is essentially like a toner, without the drying aspect.  It cleans very well, and my face doesn't feel tight afterwards.  Would have given 5 stars, but don't like having to buy pads to use the product.  Still I am reordering!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,Bought this product in a department store. So glad I was able to find it here. I tend not to use skin products on a regular basis. Not so with this cleanser. I love it. Leaves my face feeling squeaky clean.
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Life Changing,"I am not exaggerating when I say this cleanser is life changing. I have very sensitive and reactive skin that's prone to dryness and have had acne since middle school. I use this the same way I would a toner, but to remove make up and in lieu of washing my face in the morning. With this product my skin is clearer than it has ever been!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,You Need This,"My first time trying micellar water in my routine and have to say this does a great job. I use it after I cleanse before moisturizing and I use about one to two cotton balls to clean over my face and neck and it really picks up extra dirt that doesn't get cleaned with my cleanser. The bottle is beautiful too. I haven't tried any other comparable products yet but Origins is really one of my favorite go-to brands and they just don't disappoint. Also, I have oily and acne prone skin and this stuff really aids in clearing my skin."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Origins Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,"I use micellar waters to remove my eye and face makeup before cleansing with my facial cleanser and clarisonic. I recently bought the bioderma brand for sensitive skin because of the good price, good reviews, and generous size. After using this for a few weeks, I noticed my under eyes feeling dry and tight, which isn't normally an issue. I did use this product tonight to remove my eye and face makeup and had no dry, tight sensation. I will stick to this as the ingredients are safer and more gentle."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Swell,Love this cleanser. Really gets down and clears all the makeup off my skin. Doesn't irritate at all for me. Definitely a staple in my skin care routine.
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,This Product is Terrific!,"I bought this micellar cleanser right when it came out, and because I had never used a product such as this before, I had no preconceived notions of how it would work for me, but I'm a fan or Origins products, so thought I'd give it a try. Glad I did!! I use mine first thing in the morning, no water or soap, and add my moisturizers for the day. It's divine!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,Decent toner,"Smells nice, leaves skin oil free, is alcohol free, leaves a bit more of a residue than I would like."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,perfect for sensitive skin,"My skin was in a rosacea flare, and even the most gentle of cleanser with a cool baby's washcloth was angering it. I read a few reviews about this line and decided to try the micellar and I could not be happier. My skin calmed right down and I now use it morning and night as my only cleanser. It removes makeup well and is so, so, so gentle!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,a staple in my regimen,"This is one of my favourite skincare products. I use it to remove makeup, or I pat it on after I wash my face as a toner. Since I started using it my redness on my face is almost non existent. My skin was so sensitive that I had to douse it in witch hazel twice a day and now that I use this, no pain or sensitivity either. I highly recommend it to people with sensitive skin and any redness they want to get rid of."
ORIGINS-Dr. Weil For Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Micellar Cleanser,USA,It's ok...,"It gets the makeup off fair but my skin is tingling/slightly burning after use and I find I need to at least splash water on my face after to relieve it, which defeats the whole purpose of water free."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Canada,Disappointed,"I am a die hard Tatcha fan and I was excited to try this product as I already use the deep cleanse, deep rice polish, water cream, peony eye cream and the silk cloth. Unfortunately the texture tonic caused me to break out more than I every have in my life - including my teen years. Although I know skin can take some time to adjust to a new product, considering it took 5 days for my skin to clear up, I didn't want to take the chance."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"Over drying on my oily skin and made it worse.
Also very sensitive skin as well I don’t recommend. I wanted to love this."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,amazing,"I’m on my second bottle.  It didn’t take long to see a difference in skin texture.  My skin is smooth, pores are barely visible.  I love this stuff.  I use it morning and night."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Returned,I returned this. Caused redness and sensitivity on my normally not sensitive skin. It could be user error as not quite sure where it goes in my routine.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,"Overrated, overpriced",I'm not sure what the hype is over this product. This toner did NOTHING for my pores and I've been using it for months. Definitely NOT worth the $$$ tag.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Caused Red Bumps and Oiliness,"This is my first time writing a review, and I usually don’t write them, but I felt I should for this product because it was really hyped for me and I was told it was basically the best toner for my skin. The product did feel nice on my skin, but I quickly stopped using it after noticing it had caused some small red bumps to appear on my skin, which has never happened to me before, as well as making my face extremely oily, which was strange because my skin is usually dry or normal. I will be returning this because it did not work for me."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Malaysia,Great for oily textured skin,"I bought this for my husband with oily skin who has textured skin. After one week of using it in his AM routine, he claims that his face which normally turns into a greaseball by noon stayed relatively shine-free until late evening. I have also noticed that his face has a nice glow in the morning too!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Love this so much!,Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smooth.  I love that it doesn’t burn at all like most toners do (I have really sensitive skin).
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Singapore,Good product!,"I love this product! It applies well, and I really enjoy including it in my skincare routine! Highly recommended! :) "
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Highly Recommend!,"I was skeptical about buying this product. There are so many aha/bha liquids that you can choose from. Honestly, the price is worth the product! I noticed a drastic change in my skin texture after adding this into my routine. I have never had a completely smooth face until I started using this!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Singapore,Tatcha Texture Tonic,The tonic is soo good that it removes all e impurities/dirt on my face. Highly recommended for those with oily skin/combi. It does not clogs my pores at all!! 
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Canada,worth the price!,The amazing reviews are no joke! Within days my skin has visibly changed. Much more radiant and soft. Fine lines are softening and old breakouts are clearing/ marks fading.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Surprised at the speed!,"About 7 days in and THERE IS A DIFFERENCE! I’ve always struggled with texture on my forehead since I was 14 (20 years now) but as I got older and out of the acne phase, it’s just been moderately textured skin. Always showed under my makeup, etc. After reading reviews and hearing about this product, I decided to buy and I am so glad I did. Can’t believe there’s already a difference, and everywhere on my face that isn’t textured is nice and glowy."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Amazing Product for Oily Skin,"The Tatcha Water Cream has been my holy grail for awhile and thought I would try this. I have tried so many other skincare products to help my uneven texture, clogged pores, and oily skin and this is the best! My face looked and felt so clean after using this treatment, without feeling dried out. My face wasn't shiny at all for the entire day after using, which never happens for my oily skin. I followed the suggested Tatcha routine and it made my skin look better than it ever has. This is replacing Paula's Choice exfoliating liquid for me, which tells you that it's good. I'm obsessed!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"It’s only been a week of using this and I’m seeing changes in my skin! It looks more smooth, my face is less oily and my acne scars are slowly disappearing! This is a holy grail for my acne prone skin!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"Love, love, LOVE this product. I have been dealing with hormonal acne and someone suggested I try the Tatcha products. This as well other Tatcha products have definitely helped my skin and I have not had any breakouts. Was a little pricey, but definitely worth it!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,try this Tonic it’s absolutely fabulous.,I use 99% Tatcha products for my skincare regimen. I was just thrilled to get this Texture Tonic. It has closed my pores completely. I will never be without this product ever again!!! It’s my new go to skincare product. If you have any issues with large pores you have to try this. I’ve only been using this for about 2 1/2 weeks. But the change in my pores size is very noticeable. I highly recommend this tonic.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Singapore,Holy grail. ,"I have been eyeing this product for a looooooonnnnggg time and finally decided to get it. Omg, it could be anymore timely. It really helped to reset my skin texture and calm down my breakouts. It doesn’t sting even tho there are AHAs. I have been using this in the evening together with the Tatcha Essence and both are a great combination. Overall a great product worth investing in. "
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,I BELIEVE WHAT IT ADVERTISED,"I was very skeptical buying this because of the price range. Since there’s no mini version I just have to trust it. I love this. After one week the texture on my skin decreased by … a lot lol. I don’t have acne prone skin so I’m not sure how it would affect others who do have it. But it almost has a natural blurring effect on my skin. Once I get the coloring right on my skin and combine it with this, I might not need foundation anymore. Love love it."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,HOLY GRAIL!!,"Holy grail!! I love this toner. My face looks so much better, is much smoother, and the blackheads on my nose are gradually fading. I will never stop buying this omgg"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Singapore,Texture Tonic,Thumbs up! Tonic have a fermented smell. Hydrating for skin. Pricey.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Amazing! (Oily and fair skin.),"This toner is fantastic and does exactly what it says it does. I have fair skin that gets red very easily, toners have never been tolerated by my skin because of this. But this toner, this toner is amazing. It doesn’t make my sensitive skin red and actually helps keep my oily T zone under control. I highly recommend giving it a try."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,not for dry skin,"I am so torn on this product! It works AMAZING for texture! After just two nights of using this, my skin is the SOFTEST it’s ever been my whole adult life. My redness significantly decreased. I didn’t notice any difference with my pores. My issue with this product is that it’s not good for dry skin. My skin felt very tight after application and the next morning I woke up with extremely oily and greasy skin because this stripped my already dry skin. I am really torn on returning this or keeping it and just using it less. It REALLY works for texture but dry skin babes, proceed with caution. Maybe get a sample first before committing to the full size bottle. I definitely recommend this to the oily skin people out there with texture problems."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,A keeper!,"This tonic is great.  I find it clears pores, and since starting this, my skin is smoother and more balanced.  I will be keeping this in my routine."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Not worth it,"I bought this based on reviews but then I noticed later all the great reviews were from people who got this for free. Not saying everyone isn’t being truthful however, this stuff made the texture of my skin worse and gave me weird bumps all over my face. It’s definitely getting returned especially for the price."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Amazinggg,"The difference in my skin is undeniable! I usually use the Dr. Gross two step peel, but this has me SOLD. it’s easier, less time consuming and just as effective."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Amazing Tonic,This tonic is awesome! I have been consistently using it at least once per day for the past two weeks. My skin is smoother with less texture. I wish it came in a smaller size for traveling.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Best toner for dry acne skin,"I rarely put on reviews but I have to for this Tatcha Toner. I brought this when I was in Hawaii. I had heavy acne and blemish issue. I’m 21, gay man, had super dry skin. I use this on a daily basis and it works miraculously. Definitely repurchase!!!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,"Super refreshing, skin clearing!",This is incredibly refreshing on the skin and feels very clarifying without being harsh. Love it! My skin also looks brighter and feels softer after regular use.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Amazing! Helped my redness and surface acne,"I am an avid Tatcha user but I hadn’t tried their liquid treatment formulas yet. My cheeks have been experiencing flakiness, dullness, irritation, redness and surface acne from the coke weather and mask wearing. I decided to give this exfoliating treatment and try and within three days of using this morning and night my cheeks are already less flaky and my surface acne and redness is almost completely gone! Love this product I think it’s extremely effective yet gentle. It’s a little tingly at first on the skin but not irritating and the smell is different than normal Tatcha smells but I would say it smell is energizing and fresh."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,Love this on my skin. Does not irritate. Good for combination skin. Pricey. I wish it was more affordable.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,BUY THIS NOW!,"I rarely write reviews on skincare because of how subjective it can be, but this product is seriously amazing. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now, about 4 times a week and I have never had a product that made such an impact on my skin. I have seen the biggest improvements in my overall skin texture and tone. I was using an exfoliating toner before this that I thought worked fine but this overtakes it, no questions about it. I know the price is quite hefty but I promise you it's worth it. The only negative I have to say about this product is the smell is a little strong.  Other than that I will be buying this again when it runs out."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,WOW!!!,"This stuff is absolutely AMAZING!!! I’ve only been using this six days, but OMG I’m blown away. I experienced results after using it only once. My face has NEVER been as smooth as it is now, and my pores have literally disappeared. I didn’t expect this product to work (I’ve never used anything like this before), but it’s a miracle worker!!! And it’s totally worth the price!!! I hope they never stop making this product…I’m def going to be a user for life!!!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Results for days!,"I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review.

My skin is kind of sensitive and love that texture tonic is so gentle yet shows amazing results!

I used it for 3 weeks before writing this review to allow my skin time to take in the product but I literally saw results in like 2 days. This product isn’t like any other exfoliator I’ve used. Its very light on the skin and doesn’t dry the skin out. My skin is visibly firmer and pores are small. Definitely recommend this product!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha Tonic,"Hands down best toner I’ve used and always so excited to for my skincare routine when I jump out of bed. Immediate first impression: smells great and soothes my skin. For the few weeks I’ve used it, I’ve noticed my skin texture improve and some redness disappear. However, since I have really sensitive skin, I can only use it a couple times a week or every other day since it is an “exfoliating treatment”.

TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,"Smoother, more even, less hyperpigmentation","#SephoraPartner
 I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review & today i’m talking about the one I selected to test. I chose to review @tatcha the texture tonic Aha liquid exfoliating treatment. I’ve been using this tonic since mid January & I’ve been looking forward to sharing my honest opinions. While I used a gift card to purchase this tonic, these are my honest opinions. 

Details: This tonic is a liquid exfoliator formulated  with fruit AHAs niacinamide, Japanese mugwort & wild rose. Designed to event both texture & skin tone as well as calm & leave your skin smooth. Recommended for combination or oily skin. Liquid exfoliation is gentle & removes dead skin cells to help with congested pores. In addition to the above, the tonic has the scent of the  sweet fennel & rosemary oil to minimize excess sebum & oil creation while it boosts your mood. This is a cruelty-free product 

My experience: For reference, I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin with some redness & sensitivity. This is a yellow, watery tonic that removes dead skin cells, oil, & dirt as well as unclogs pores. It has a lovely scent that isn’t too strong. I’ve been using this since 1/17 & my sensitive skin hasn’t experienced any irritation. I do take care not to use it when I’m using retinol. My skin is more even & smooth with a healthy glow. This doesn’t dry out my skin luckily nor does it leave a sticky/oily residue. I also notice it helps with oil reduction. you can see lightening of my hyperpigmentation (not including the random breakout). 

 Overall: I am LOVING the results I’m seeing so far from my use of this Tatcha tonic. My skin is smoother, more even & with less oil. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin or leave my skin dry or oily. This retails for $59 which is steep. Keep in mind it will last a long time & works well. 4/5

TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I was currently looking into trying out a new toner and so I decided to give this a try. I have been using this toner now for about three weeks and definitely see great improvement overall. It’s lightweight and has a refreshing scent. After using it for a week my pores appeared smaller and cleared out some redness. I have used a few other products to help with my oily skin and this toner seems to have done the best so far. I also have very sensitive skin so trying new products are always a risk but I am glad I went for it. It does nothing but make my skin feel amazing! This is my first time trying out a product from this brand and I am very impressed and looking into getting the moisturizing cream to go with it.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Great Add To My Everyday Skin Routine.,"“I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review“ 

I was looking for a toner to help keep my skin balanced and have some added benefits and this did just that! I love the formula, the smell isn’t overbearing and this product is straight to the point and does exactly what it’s suppose to do. My skin is pretty normal and I do experience many breakouts so the added AHA very bumped up my skincare game."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Canada,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"So amazing! Visibly helped with the texture on my skin as well as acne and redness. I saw changes in my overall skin look and glow. Favourite toner I have used, and there have been a lot!!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,A great exfoliating treatment!,"I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review and I am happy I was able to get my hands on the tatcha texture tonic AHA liquid exfoliating treatment. It is super gentle on the skin, my skin was super smooth after trying for the first time . My pores did appear visibly smaller after using for 3 weeks. It is not drying at all so perfect to use during the colder months. I definitely recommend trying this if you are looking for a gentle way to even your skin tone and texture ."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"This tonic is AMAZING. I don't know how i lived without it before! 
First week of using:
I replaced my toner with this treatment and applied the product on a cotton pad and followed with my typical routine. After a week of using it, my face was super dry and started getting patchy. I was super confused because I have never been disappointed with Tatcha products before so I decided to change it up.
Second week and counting:
I decided to go back to using my toner and then using this tonic after applying toner and applying it straight with my hands (no cotton pad) following with my typical routine and after a week of doing this routine I have seen the build up of white heads on my nose area gone! It has gotten rid of my dry patches as well. I use it daily morning and night time and am so impressed."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Skincare Must Have!,"I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. My goal is to improve my texture and tone. I wanted to see how well this product worked by itself so this was the only thing I changed about my routine, I didn’t use any other tatcha products with it. After just one week I started to see results. My skin was more vibrant and my pores less visible. The product itself is light and doesn’t have a strong smell. I have sensitive skin and it didn’t irritate my face at all. The photos show my skin before I started using it and after 3 weeks. I’m in love and want to try other Tatcha products!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I've been using Tatcha products for a while but have yet to try the texture tonic so I wanted to give this a shot! First of all, I want to say that I have sensitive skin and Tatcha products can be hit or miss with me. I've been using this for a few weeks now and have seen some improvement with my skin tone evening out. It also helped remove any excess dirt and make up! I used this twice a week as it is an exfoliator and exfoliating every day can be bad for your skin. It's a nice refresher every now and then! And a little goes a long way so you can make it last as long as you want!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,excellent!,"While I love Tatcha’s double cleanse and essence, this texture tonic is amazing! I didn’t think it would make so much difference, but it really does make pores appear smaller and leaves skin petal soft."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,This is my daily gentle exfoliating toner that I use day and night. It also has added benefits like an antioxidants. My skin glows after I’ve been using this. I’m on my second bottle already.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Beautiful toner!,"I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. Firstly, the packaging is absolutely beautiful! This toner is gentle, lightweight, and doesn’t leave behind a sticky residue! I’ve been using this toner 3x a week and noticed some improvements in my combo skin. There was no irritation, and my skin looks calmer and feels smoother. There is a herbal almost licorice scent to it, but it does fade pretty quickly. Overall, this is a lovely toner."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Canada,love. it.,"bought this the day I heard it came out, and it has not disappointed. been using about 2 weeks now. I have some rough texture on the sides of my face, from my temples down an inch. this has definitely made a visible improvement to that area. I also have uneven skintone with lots of redness on my cheeks and chin, and ive noticed that has calmed down a little as well. I use it right after cleansing and before my tatcha essence."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Canada,useless,Didn’t do anything for me whatsoever and I’ve been using it for 2 weeks
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,excellent - does what it says,"I’m not new to the exfoliating toner game, and have tried everything from drugstore cult favorites to luxury spa brands. I’m not giving this five stars lightly; here’s how it stacks up 
- many aha toners leave a sticky, tacky finish. This goes on very light with no residue 
- I’ve been dealing with some redness lately and this has made a noticeable improvement 
- pleasant herbal scent 
- my skin feels smoother and leans matte after use
- has not irritated my sensitive skin 

My only beef is that after about three weeks use 2x/day, the bottle is looking about halfway empty. It’s going to be an expensive habit if it goes that fast, but overall, yeah. This toner brings something new, and if you haven’t found an aha toner you like, maybe give this one a try"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Replacing my peel pads,"I just got this so the review may be too soon but wow, is this amazing.  I love and use a number a Tatcha products but this one has jumped to the top of the list.  I don't use this as my toner, I use a more moisturizing product for that.  I use this in place of the peel pads I used to use.  After about a week, my skin is smoother.  I just love the little bit of tingle I get from it.  So far I'm only using it once a day, over time I might increase it to twice a day.  if you have very sensitive skin, I would do a patch test for a few days first.  While I'm sure younger people will jump on this, I want to assure mature ladies that this is a winner for us too."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,Works amazing. Best toner I’ve used. I have a textured face and it smoothed out my face especially my T zone. I noticed a difference after a week. I will keep purchasing for as long as I can.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Best toner i’ ve ever used,The best toner I have ever used. I have small pimples here and there on my face whole of my life though I used many from expensive to drug store products. But this toner really clears out my face. My teen daughter uses it too and her acnes lessens so much. We use moisturizer on top this toner. I’ll keep buying for more after i run out
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"I love this stuff! I have been using this in addition to the rice wash and the skin soothing repair indigo cream. I have rosacea and this, in combination with the others, has cleared it up almost immediately! I was skeptical about trying a new brand, but this is definitely my new go-to."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"I like this exfoliating toner a lot, as it definitely works, yet is still gentle enough that it would be an ideal starting point for anyone looking to try out/begin using chemical exfoliants in their skincare routine, or for when you want to help prevent congestion. 

Despite applying this immediately after cleansing (which is when you should apply a liquid exfoliant and/or toner), I did find that it took a while to sink in fully, which I suspect is due to the various plant oils included in the ingredients - it's not necessarily a bad thing, since the oils can help offset dryness caused by the acids, but conversely, they can also be irritants on some skin (particularly those sensitive to essential oils). 

It's not a deal breaker, especially since it didn't cause any subsequent absorption issues with any of the products I applied afterwards, but still worth noting. If you like to use multiple products afterwards, definitely give them time to sink in to avoid pilling. I think this will be more useful in warmer weather at reducing oil, and it does help a bit in evening out skin. Definitely depends on your skin type and the climate. On the whole, it's a product I enjoy, but not a game changer. Gifted by Tatcha."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,It works but it's not my favorite.,"This product is a nice toner, however, I think I prefer a toner that also doubles as a moisturizer. I'm sure it pairs wonderfully with their water cream, which I do love. 
I have my eye on another product which will be my go to when this one is out. 
I also don't enjoy the scent, which was disappointing because I usually like Tatcha's scents. Tatcha has good products, but this one doesn't do it for me. If you're unsure, get a sample/travel size and try it first. 
The bottle itself is very sturdy, so you'll need something to put it onto to apply it. 
(Or I suppose you could shake it onto your hand)."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,This product was complimentary from Tatcha and it has evened out my skin tone. I love using this product after a shower when my face is completely clean. I used to use very harsh toners that stripped my skin and I am glad I found this one.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"This texture tonic was gifted by Tatcha in exchange for my review. This beautifully herbal/floral scented toner is housed in an equally stunning bottle. The minty colored glass bottle feels sturdy, though the cap is a bit more fragile since it arrived cracked. Looks aside, the actual product performs! The silky texture exfoliating treatment helps soothe, soften and hydrate the skin. Would definitely keep using!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Oily girl’s BFF,A refreshing tingle was my first impression of this tonic! I have had oily skin my entire life & this was such a lovely addition to my skincare routine. After a full week of use I could feel the difference this was making on my skin. It felt smoother than before! I also noticed that my skin wasn’t getting as oily. I love this! I’ve been using this for nearly a month now & have experienced no irritation or skin sensitivities. My skin is glowing & looks so much healthier!
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Nothing special,Made my skin very oily/shiny and unhealthy looking.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Love it,"This was gifted to me by Tatcha for my honest review. This exfoliant is not only gentle but  it helps calm my redness, it also helps my skin's texture. I really like the results so far and I can't wait to see what else it will do for my skin."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,First the packaging is beautiful and sturdy. It just looks so pretty on my vanity.  This has a nice lightweight formula but it does come with a herbal scent. Not sure everyone will enjoy that. I do enjoy that it makes my skin softer after each use.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,In love,"This is the best toner I've tried so far! It helped me to improve the appearance of my skin I had many black spots due to acne I had tried many products for that but nothing had helped me until I tried this toner, it is really good, the texture is light and it has a refreshing sensation after applying it! 
Complimentary from Tatcha!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"Gifted by Tatcha Beauty for an honest review. The packaging is beautiful. The scent reminds me of licorice and it took a few uses for me to get past the scent, however after I got used to it I was able to really enjoy the product. It left my skin looking and feeling wonderful."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Loving the effects!,"The packaging is beautiful and heavy weight, I love having it on my vanity. It is a little difficult to dispense the product due to the hard walls of the packaging so you have to dribble it out onto a cotton pad. This feels great on my skin and is lightweight, doesn't leave much of a residue at all and leaves me feeling very clean. It has made my skin appear more glowy, plump, and less red after twice a day use for just one week! I love the effects and look forward to using this every day! The only thing I wish were different was the strong herbal scent, but it fades quickly once you use it and I rinse my face after use anyhow. Just something to keep in mind if you have sensitive skin. For reference, I have oily to combination skin.
(This product was gifted by Tatcha for review purposes, all opinions are my own)"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Canada,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"So far, I'm loving this product. I have sensitive skin and this hasn't caused any issues so far (knock on wood). It also feels nice on the skin and it does seem like my pores are smaller when looking in the mirror."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,In love with packaging and feel,"Loving this product! I received this complimentary from Tatcha, and I have been using it every day for about a week.

TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,Absolutely obsessed with this product gifted by Tatcha!! It smells amazing and my skin feels so clean after use. After using for a couple of weeks I have seen a great improvement in my skin texture and pores!
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Level up your skin!,"I received this product complimentary of tatcha and have been incredibly surprised by the results. Aside from the sleek packaging, this product is what you need in your 10 step routine for next level skin! It gives the foundation of bright, even, hydrated, and dew-like skin needed before a perfect full face of makeup. I love how adding this to my skin routine takes my skin to the next level!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Helps control oil,I’m very happy with this! The bottle is so gorgeous and sleek the product inside is quite beautiful too. It’s a gentle formula yet gives me a nice radiant appearance without my skin feeling raw or irritated. It does contain some essential oils so if you are sensitive to those you may want to pass. There isn’t much scent so it’s safe for sensitive people. So far I feel like it’s helping my oily skin to calm down a bit as I blot less during the day.  Gifted by Tatcha
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Nice!,This was gifted by Tatcha. I haven’t tried much of this brand and now I need to try more. This is so nice! I’ve had blackheads on my cheeks and nose lately as well as some texture on my chin. This has made makeup look weird.  Without a lot of use this has improved the texture and blackheads significantly. . My makeup looks a lot smoother! This didn’t irritate or dry out my face.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,My new holy grail,This is the most luxurious gentle toner I’ve ever used. My skin feels so hydrated and silky every time I apply this product. I love to use this product morning and night. This also enhances my makeup foundation routine as well. This product was Complimentary from Tatcha.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Love this,"I received this Texture Tonic complimentary from Tatcha and I am really liking this so far. I like to pour a couple of drops on my palm and pat it into my skin. It's lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. It leaves a soothing cool feeling as it soaks into my skin. I have noticed that my skin looks a lot clearer and brighter. I haven't used it long enough to see much of a difference in my pores. But I love Tatcha, I don't think there has been a product I've tried from them that I haven't loved"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"Firstly, the packaging is everything! Weighty, luxurious and such a joy to look at on my countertop. Secondly, I haven’t been using the texture tonic long enough to have full thoughts but it leaves my skin feeling visibly smoother, and not irritated after about a week of use. Gifted by Tatcha."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"Full disclosure, this product was gifted to me by Tatcha, but I don’t want anyone to waste money so this will be an honest review. If you have oily skin, this is your new BFF. People think oily skin isn’t sensitive, but let me tell you - it definitely can be. I love that this product does a great job of chemically exfoliating, without burning, stinging or stripping the skin. I noticed a difference in the clarity of my skin with just one week of use, every other night. 

Tatcha can do no wrong and they knocked it out of the park with this one again."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,"Lovely light toner, soothing & smoothing","I received the Texture Toner complimentary from Tatcha in exchange for my honest review. I have really loved using this toner. It's slightly acidic, so I use it right after washing my face to prepare it for my next products - cotton pad or patting in with hands works equally well. My skin feels soft and smooth & I have not had any irritation from this. The addition of mugwort was such a wonderful surprise! I love mugwort and it's SO soothing to my skin. The watery texture sinks in quickly and leaves no residue. I'll definitely keep using to see the longer term effects. Also, I love the scent!!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"I’m a sucker for toners just like this! My skin loves Niacinamide and ahas so I was pretty excited to try this. Upon first application I noticed some tightness in my pores but not uncomfortable tightness. So far I’m enjoying this, but I could do without the"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Gentle yet effective AHA toner!,"Everyone seems to have an AHA toner now, but Tatcha still manages to outdo them! I’m loving this gentle yet effective toner; gentle enough to use everyday, but effective enough to see immediate results. My skin looks clearer, more even and smoother after just a week."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Great Gentle and Effective Exfoliant!,"I received this product complimentary from Tatcha for review. This toner has noticeably improved the look and feel of my skin! It makes my skin so soft and smooth. I love how it makes my skin look without makeup on and it makes my makeup go on smoother, too. My skin tends to be on the sensitive side, but I haven't had any irritation from this product, even when using it alongside other actives in my routines. Everything about using this toner feels so effortless- how it absorbs into my skin, layers with other products, and fits into my routines."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Glowy skin,As it says it helps with skin firmness and also uneven skin it sure does help. I’ve used this daily and I do see improvement on my skin. There is also no scent with this product and a little goes a long way. Gifted by tatcha.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Good AHA product,"This is a good product! It comes in a beautiful glass bottle. There is a slight unpleasant scent, but nothing too strong. I love the way it feels on my skin. It leaves my skin feeling clean but moisturized— not dry. I think this is a great option for an AHA toner. I received this complimentary from Tatcha."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Glowing skin,After cleansing I used this texture tonic on a cotton pad all over my face. It gets rid of everything that was left over that my cleanser just couldn’t get. I love how smooth and glowy my skin looks afterwards! It doesn’t strip your face from its essential oils either it’s just perfect. I would honestly use this as my sole product after cleansing because it gives my face everything it needs to be healthy and clear.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"Gifted by Tatcha. This is a great exfoliant ffor beginners. it is not stripping and did not make my skin purge. although it is pricier, i think it is worth it for those who love japanese skincare products"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Yes please,"I was kindly gifted by Tatcha the Tatcha texture tonic AHA Liquid Exfoliating Treatment and let me tell y’all, if you haven’t tried this stuff, I highly recommend. This is the first Tatcha product I’ve ever tried but I finally understand what the rave is all about. My skin is combination to oily in the winter and combination to oily in the summer but pores and texture are always an issue. After using this tonic for a couple of weeks, my skin is starting to look and feel more soft and smooth. The packaging adds aesthetic to my vanity and the tonic does wonders for my skin. This is a winner for me."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"I was gifted by Tatcha in exchange for my review. The product reminds me of the Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting treatment, it evens my skin's texture as well as even helps with my redness. The packaging is also very luxurious and looks amazing on my skincare shelf."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,LOVE THIS,This was gifted to me by Tatcha & I loved using this product and noticed my pores were smaller and my skin texture completely changed. I had never used Tatcha products and can’t wait to try more after falling in love with this product.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,I received this complimentary from Tatcha.First of all I really love the packing and how my skin feels after applying. This tonic is really very effective. It really does do what it says in the label. My skin was showing good results. After a few days I’ve noticed smaller pores and hydrated skin.I will definitely stick to this brand.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,This product is really nice for multiple reasons. It’s gentle but effective in exfoliating and brightening the skin. Some of my favorite ingredients are in this toner too! I love mugwort and niacinamide because they work really well to even out my skin tone! (Gifted by Tatcha)
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,This was gifted by Tatcha! Tatcha is amazing if you didn’t already know and this product did wonders for my skin! Everything looks so smooth and even it’s unbelievable! It does have a scent to it so if you’re at all sensitive to that just be aware.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"This product has saved my skin, it’s really good! I haven’t been using it for long but I can see the difference in my skin already.  It’s very smoothing on my skin and is super easy to use at night. I was gifted by tacha"

TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"[Gifted by Tatcha] I've always wanted to try this brand, and I am so thankful that I finally had the chance to! The packaging of this product is stunning. The color and feel is just so pretty! The texture of the product itself is very light and watery and has a very unique fruity (yet somewhat herbal) scent to it. My skin has felt so good from using it and I'm definitely going to use it up, though it makes me a bit sad at how $$$ it is. Will definitely be on the lookout to trying other Tatcha products in the future too!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Incredible Texture Toner,"I have been applying this texture tonic morning and night and sometimes in the middle of the day, for the past couple weeks. It helps take away excess oil, without drying me out. I am really impressed by how quickly the results have happened! Right out of the luxurious, beautiful, tall glass bottle, I apply the watery texture formulation onto a cotton round pad. I swipe it on my face and it absorbs quickly. It does a fabulous job at hydrating and plumping my oily/combination skin. With consistent use, my skin now appears brighter, more even, all while reducing redness. I struggle with clogged pores and oiliness in my t-zone and I've experienced no issues while using this gentle chemical exfoliation. I have noticed a significant difference in my pores being smaller and uneven texture more visibly even. I definitely recommend giving this incredible tonic toner a try!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Hydrating and gentle!,"I received this product complimentary from tatcha. One thing about my exfoliants is that they have to be hydrating and gentle- this one hit all the points! I really love how it didn’t sting my skin and left it feeling hydrated after application. For me, the benefits of the mugwort are super impressive because it’s really soothing on the skin and has a nice herbal scent to it. Not to mention the packaging on this product is so luxurious and would make the perfect gift!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,I gifted by  Tatcha. I really liked this tonic ! very gentle. great tonic. gentle cleansing and does not irritate the skin. the skin is moisturized and toned. Easy to apply. I love it. I highly recommend this product!
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"I was gifted by Tatcha the Tatcha Texture Tonic. I've been applying this texture tonic twice daily for a few weeks andI'm really enjoying it! Right out of the tall, beautiful glass bottle it's a watery texture‹"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Beautiful Product and Beautiful Results,"I received this gifted by Tatcha but I really value being honest in reviews because I wouldn’t want y’all to waste money on an okay product. So here we go: I use retinoids from my Derm often so my skin is quite sensitive to acids. I was able to ease this into my routine carefully and have actually really been liking it. I did go through a slight purging in the beginning bc I dont use AHAS a lot but ive gotten used to it and my skin is loving it. It feels smooth and healthy. I pair it with very moisturizing products because i don’t want to strip my skin. I have been using this twice a week and seeing results. Not sure if I would buy this with my own money as a college student because this is def out of my budget but if you can afford it, get it!!! Really amazing product and makes you feel boujee and beautiful."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,So far so good!,"I received this gifted by Tatcha for my honest review. 
i have acne prone, textured, super oily skin so I totally need chemical exfoliants. I love my P50 lotion, however, while effective, it sometimes stings and the scent is kind of rough. This on the other hand is gentle, smells a little citrusy, and hasn't broken me out yet! So far so good. I prefer this user experience and it might just replace my P50!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,Love this new aha toner from Tatcha! It works to chemically exfoliate your skin and left my skin smoother and less dull overall. I would say that it is gentle enough for all skin types which makes it a great option for someone who is new to chemical exfoliants
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,Gifted by tatcha. This toner is so soothing and refreshing. The scent is also so fresh and clean. It leaves my skin looking so supple and smooth the next day I wake up. Highly recommend this toner you won’t regret it
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Singapore,satisfactory,Quite an average face wash!! I found it as a good deal given its price and it worked fine. Works well for dry skin and useful as a second step wash after makeup removal
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Singapore,Ms,Cleansing is always important step as I have daily makeup I am concern of cleansing step this indie Lee never let me down is cleans n yet not leave my face dry love it 
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Singapore,gel texture and fresh finish,bought this after a trial pack as i really liked the way it leaves my face clean and smooth but not stripped of moisture. the gel texture is also easy to wash off and great for our tropical weather
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Malaysia,miss,The face wash is good. But the packaging for small size isn’t very convenient to use as it runs out quickly due to the texture. Overall I’m satisfied with the product
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Singapore,Did not enjoy this,Did not enjoy the smell nor the feeling of it after washing my face. Does not feel clean afterwards and would feel like I need to wash my face again..
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Singapore,-,First time trying their product and this seems like quite a popular one so was curious and so far so good! Will continue trying do give it a try too! 
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Malaysia,Purifying Face Wash,A very ordinary purifying face cleanser. I have finished a whole bottle and I have yet to see any improvement in my oiliness. Won't purchase it again anyway.
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Philippines,Underwhelming,"For its price, I was expecting some thing special or any changes on my skin. But I don't think I saw any. I only got the sample size, I don't know if I ought to use it longer"
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Singapore,love this cleanser! ,"Great value and great product. Just one pump is enough to cover my face and neck, and leaves not too much suds. Easy to wash off as well. It’s also gentle too. Will definitely repurchase. 
"
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Malaysia,just ok,Doesnt affect me in a negative way but also doesnt do that much wonders. No longer repurchasing due to price not within my budget for its effectiveness.
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Singapore,great product ,I love the way my skin feels after using this face wash! It feels clean and fresh but still hydrated! And I love the smell too! Works well with my combination skin.
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Singapore,indie Lee,"First time to try this indie Lee products. My friends recommended me to use this indie Lee products. Because of oil free, paraded free and etc. Love it and highly recommended."
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Singapore,So worth the price ,I was a bit hesitant to buy this cleanser especially after looking at the price. but my usual cataphil and clean and clear wash was drying up my face (I have combination skin) so I took a leap of faith and tried this instead. I'm very glad I did because my skin cleared up and is softer than ever  🙌🏻 
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Australia,Not sure ,"I'm not so sure about this Purifying face wash... I've been using mine for about one month now and it doesn't seem to do much, don't have that good clean sensation like YTTP... something that also bothers me is the smell."
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Malaysia,Lovely - Suitable for sensitive skin,"Lovely product, goes on smooth and silky on the skin, similar to another famous cleanser. Suitable for sensitive skin. Bought the small bottle for trial. The only off thing about it is the scent, its not pleasant and slightly smells of rancidity. "
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Singapore,Not sure it did much,"Indie Lee is a great brand, clean ingredients, cruelty free etc, albeit expensive! I got a trial of this cleanser and while it softened my skin, I didn’t really see much of a difference in my skin clearing up, texture etc. Maybe just not effective on my combo, sensitive skin that is prone to random breakouts. It has a lot of scent, even tho it’s not artificial. OK but not buying it again. "
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Malaysia,One of the best face cleansers I used,"When I got it the first time as travel version I did not really like it, but decided to complete it. Two weeks later I looked in the mirror and couldn’t believe how clean my face has become. Purchased full size and will be using it now! "
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Malaysia,Good Face Wash, Really loves the scent of rosewater. Just need a small amount for the face wash. Face looks hydrated and fresh after first wash. No harsh ingredients. Top rated product.
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Malaysia,great,"My skin feels soft after using the cleanser. It didn't cause me anything bad, but i wouldn't preach it either. I need to use quite a lot to be satisfied within a usage. So it might not last very long. If you have the means, go for it since it's a clean brand. If not, it's not a loss. "
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Singapore,Tried it once,"Bought a small one to try out. Just note that this does not foam up and if you like lots of Foam, this is not the one you are looking for. Also, dont really fancy the scent. And its quite pricey I must say. "
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Malaysia,refreshing! ,"I bought this cleanser from the recommendation of Beauty Within and I didn’t like it at first, due to the scent. But the longer I used it, it became more bearable. The cleanser overall feels refreshing to the skin and the bottle is quite heavy, which gives a luxurious feel to it. All in all, I would definitely recommend this cleanser!"
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Philippines,does its job,"This cleanser cleans well without drying. it is also soft on the skin and doesnt smell like chemicals at all. Overall, im not disappointed at all though i like the rosehip cleanser better with how it makes my skin feel after "
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Singapore,Great for sensitive oily skin,Very gentle and cleanses effectively. after using for 2 weeks my skin is less clogged and smooth.  No stickiness nor tightness. Suggest to buy 30ml to try
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Singapore,Underwhelming,"I’ve read and seen many rave reviews for this product, especially for combination skin. Bought a sample size to try (thankfully) and it was very underwhelming. First the sample size was so small and so expensive for the amount. Second there was a offputting scent to the product. It’s saving grace was a good gel like texture but left the skin feeling oily even after use."
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Singapore,Pretty good but..,It's a good face wash that cleanses my oily face every morning when I wake up but it's a little too mild to be used after a whole day being outside and you come home to wash your face.
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Australia,I think this is the one!,"This might just be the best cleanser I’ve ever tried. I’ve had a lot less pimples since I started using it. It feels very refreshing, gives a slight ‘squeaky clean’ feeling (which I know is bad, but I don’t feel like my day has ended unless my face feels thoroughly clean!) I just use a hydrating toner and a good moisturiser afterwards and get zero dryness problems. Only subtracting a half star for the bottle design. It’s glass, which feels luxurious, but not so great for washing your face in the shower (which I used to do). The pump is also really powerful, I had to get used to pressing it very gently, otherwise it would shoot out a good 30cm past my hand, all over the bathroom, wasting a lot of product."
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Malaysia,The best cleanser ever!!,I have a combination skin which sometimes it’s oily and sometimes it’s super dry and this cleanser suits the best for my skin! Cant get enough of it  am soo lovin ittttt!!!!!!
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Australia,I'm glowing!,This is by far my favourite cleanser of all time! My skin feels super clean and hydrated after cleansing. I've been using it with my Foreo but it also works well with massaging with fingertips. I've notice my skin isn't as dull as usual and my skin tone definitely looks more even. This cleanser is my HG for sure!
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Singapore,love the cleanser but not a fan of the smell,"Great product that cleanses my skin well but still leaves it hydrated and soft! Nice texture too, feels very luscious. Only thing I can’t stand is the smell... "
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Malaysia,Squeaky clean,"I purchased a mini size first to test out since I have very sensitive skin.

INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Singapore,awesome! ,This is my new HG cleanser! I researched for a long time before deciding on this as it's not exactly very cheap. I have dehydrated and sensitive skin that is oily on the surface (urgh!). This cleanser does a great job removing impurities yet it doesn't make my skin tight at all. It is amazingly gentle and the light scent feels very refreshing and uplifting. The bottle design is great too. Will definitely repurchase. 
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Malaysia,okay,"I just bought a small one to try - just for trying Indie Lee. It is a gentle cleanser. For me, it is just an okayy cleanser. But I don't like the smell of this product. "
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Australia,calming ,"Great, gives a very deep clean - skin is left smooth & clean. I recently had a bad chemical burn by mixing the wrong products and leaving them overnight, despite the pain - this face wash was sensitive and calming. I have been using it for almost a month and no breakouts of cystic acne."
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Singapore,Scent is strong,"When I first apply this on my face, all I could think of is how unbearable the scent is! I could not enjoy this product properly at all... even tho I am sure the product is great. Ingredients look awesome. Therefore, if you are sensitive to fragrance, I suggest you get a sample or travel size first before purchasing the actual size. "
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Malaysia,Combination Skin,"Is a luxurious cleanser, less foam more to gel type. It wont dry out my skin, at the same time wont make my skin feel tight. My very first time purchase product from this brand..."
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,New Zealand,amazing,"Never had such an amazing cleanser, took all my makeup up and left my skin feeling completely cleansed in a single wash. Doesn't hide behind fragrances, doesn't smell citrus-y to convince you it's clean, but doesn't smell terrible. Definitely helped reduced my break-outs."
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Malaysia,One of my favorites! ,"This is one of my favourite cleansers. It’s very gentle on my skin. Leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry or tight which is important as I have dry skin. It has a slight mild scent that does not bother me. However if you’re using heavy or waterproof make up, you will need to double cleanse as this doesn’t get everything off. "
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Malaysia,love,"Bersihkan muka dengan sangat lembut, tak keringkan muka, dan muka tak rasa ketat selepas dicuci. Akan repeat order untuk beli yang saiz besar. 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘"
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Philippines,Clean and luxe feeling,"It's a really pricey face wash, but if you want to treat yourself, it's a nice one to splurge on. It doesn't really do anything differently from other face washes I've used in the past, but it does deliver a very luxe feel and elegant scent that sort of justifies its price point. It is a gentle formula, doesn't strip your natural oils after use, mildly foams up for those who don't like the presence of SLS, this is a clean beauty brand that doesn't have surfectants. All in all I'm not mad to spend this much on this face wash."
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,Malaysia,Love this!,"This is my 2nd purchase. I had to buy this smaller tube as the full size ran out of stock. I absolutely love this cleanser and it feels really soft and gentle on my skin.  After washing, my skin still feels hydrated and not tight which is important to me since I have dry skin. However if you are wearing waterproof mascara, you will need to double cleanse."

I know Indie Lee is a clean beauty brand but this cleanser has such a STRONG chemical smell. Glad I bought the travel size to try. Will not repurchase cos I am highly sensitive to smell."
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,,Pretty good facewash,I have finished a whole bottle coz I love this one.My skin is super acne prone but this one soothes my acne prone skin and reduces acne.But sad thing is couldnt find this one in stock online or stores for a while.
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,,Getting used to it,"I had High expectations. It lathers well, it was more watery in consistency than gel-like, my skin feels smooth after using. Smell is very subtle. Expensive though, going to buy on sale only. Thanks"

I am totally in love with this cleanser as I am so enjoyed in its smell. It has a very nice rose scent and it leaves my skin so smooth after cleansing. I would say that this is the only thing that get me so excited every morning.
"
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,,😃,lreally liked this great gel skin cleanser! Left my skin fresh and clean without drying it out! Love the pump action! Made it easier to use and control amounts of product needed. 
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,,love it!,I love this face wash it’s my second time purchasing this item. I like how it lathers just a bit but doesn’t dry my skin. It can also remove light makeup including mascara. The smell is good too- very luxurious. The only con is the price for the amount that you get. But still planning to continue using it because my skin loves it. 
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,,Mild and gentle,"This stuff is amazing! I also really like her brightening cleanser. Her cleansers are gentle, not too foamy, and I noticed it left my skin soft and glowing from within."

I’ll definitely purchase again."
INDIE LEE-Purifying Face Wash,,Purifying,"This is great to remove make up (not for waterproof). Thick lather but not drying. Scent is fine. Easy to rinse. Does not leave skin feeling tight. Sturdy bottle. Has a lock on the pump, easy to pack during travel."
SHISEIDO-Complete Cleansing Microfoam,Singapore,Love it!,It cleans the face very well.  Face feels thoroughly cleaned but not drying.  The self foaming function dispel the correct amount of product and make cleaning fun too!
SHISEIDO-Waso Quick Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,as described,"a nice gentle cleanser, effective in cleaning the face without drying out the skin, nice scent"
SHISEIDO-Waso Quick Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,Not a fan,Too drying for my already dry skin. Would probably be better for someone with normal or oily skin. Would not be repurchasing this and wished I had researched this first before buying it on impulse!
SHISEIDO-Waso Quick Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,Favorite cleanser,I love this cleansing product! It's mild and my face feels fresh and clean after using it. Worth the price and I will definitely buy it again and again. 
SHISEIDO-Waso Quick Gentle Cleanser,,love it,"I have sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin and do a double cleanse at night. I needed a cleanser that effectively removed any residue and makeup left behind by my favorite cleansing oil. This cleanser fits the bill. It has a texture like lotion, but isn't sudsy or drying. In fact, it seems to add moisture to my skin. Plus, this cleanser smells pleasant--light, clean floral. "
SHISEIDO-Waso Quick Gentle Cleanser,,Love it,"I tried this as a sample previously. I love that the fragrance is mild and it smells good. I personally dont like cleaners that strip my skin of all the oil. This cleaner removes dirt, but yet it does not give me the squeaky clean feeling."
SHISEIDO-Waso Quick Gentle Cleanser,,one of my favourite cleansers!,This is my 5th bottle! It cleanses well yet leaves skin smooth and soft. It doesn’t dry up skin. I have dry skin and this is one of my favourite cleanser after trying so many. 
SHISEIDO-Waso Quick Gentle Cleanser,,ok only,Gentle on skin but a bit hard to wash off. Cleansing power not so strong. May be used for morning but not so good for the night. Feels dry after wash. Not worth the price. Will not buy again.
SHISEIDO-Waso Quick Gentle Cleanser,,niiiiiice,Simple but nice product. Left nice fragrance and non-soapy feeling after wash. It works well on my combination and my hub’s oily skin. Hub and me love this product.
SHISEIDO-Waso Quick Gentle Cleanser,,Not bad,"To be honest I really like the packaging and the refreshing smell - it makes me enjoy my face wash routine. However, to my personal preference, I would prefer a foaming kind of cleanser. This cleanser is gel-like, thus it doesn't produce a lot of foam. Also, it is a very mild cleanser, thus it is not recommended for girls who wear heavy make-up. I usually use it in the morning, and switch to other cleanser that have a stronger cleaning effect after a long day. Overall it is still not bad but I won't repurchase it again. "
SHISEIDO-Waso Quick Gentle Cleanser,,a very good cleanser,"I bought this for its packaging , but after I use the product,I am very glad that I bought it.it does not makes the skin feeling dry and does do its job on cleaning impurities on skin. There is one thing that need to be enhanced is that it is difficult to pour the product out."

DR.JART+-Cicapair Enzyme Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,It's okay,Bought this because my usual cleanser is out of stock. I quite like the Cica series from Dr Jart. This one matches with the Cica range Im using. I feel like it's okay and acceptable but maybe because it is foaming so it is slightly dry for me.

TATCHA-The Rice Polish Foaming Enzyme Powder,Singapore,good,"this is a good cleanser. I've flare ups of eczema at times and this is gentle enough when I've eczema. I appreciate that it's so gentle and that it doesn't leave a squeaky clean feeling to my face. the only gripe I have about this is the price. during the purchase, it really pains. however, I guess the consolation is that this cleanser lasts forever. one star deducted because its so difficult to control the amount that's being poured out - sometimes, you pour out wayyy too much."
TATCHA-The Rice Polish Foaming Enzyme Powder,Singapore,good,this costed a bomb and its kinda a big bottle so im assuming it can lasts me quite awhile since its powered. does the job well but will not repurchase 
TATCHA-The Rice Polish Foaming Enzyme Powder,Singapore,Not too bad,Expected the powder to be more fine. But it will turned into a form after you mixed with water. skin get smoother thereafter but really a bit expensive for that small bottle. 
TATCHA-The Rice Polish Foaming Enzyme Powder,Malaysia,the best cleanser ,This is my second purchase. My skin feels soft after wash. The secret is the fine grains that act to exfoliate. It is expensive but it works well on my skin. It has this faint smell but that's barely noticeable. I don't have that taut/tight feeling after wash unlike some cleansers. It's not drying either. I don't mind spending a bit since this is quality stuff and even endorsed by Hollywood celebrities. Highly recommended!  
TATCHA-The Rice Polish Foaming Enzyme Powder,Singapore,Smooth as silk.... (Classic Rice Polish) ,"Love this product. Skin feels smooth immediately after use, it's such a gentle exfoliator especially for a product with a fruit enzyme - I was worried my skin would get super irritated/agitated. I actually could feel my skin was actually smooth and glowing. Makeup applies a lot better the day after too.

Just not a super duper fan of the packaging, the huge hole on the top has caused me to accidentally shake more powder than needed a few times. 
"
TATCHA-The Rice Polish Foaming Enzyme Powder,Singapore,Deep Exfoliating Cleanser,This product exfoliates the skin from any impurities. It is good to use it once a week to deep cleanse the skin. Removes make up well. Highly recommended 
TATCHA-The Rice Polish Foaming Enzyme Powder,Malaysia,Meghan Markle favorite exfoliator,"When I got to know this rice polish powder (classic version) is the Duchess of Sussex favorite, I immediately buy once the stock is made available online. I use this twice a week, but I feel it is gentle enough to be use nightly. The packaging is not as luxurious as I expected, not in glass bottle but rather in plastic container so that is a bummer for the price we paying."

When this was available, I quickly grabbed it. Love how it foams so well, much more than the classic and washes off easily. My skin is not dry after wash.

LANCÔME-Crème Mousse-Confort,Singapore,nice product ,Recommended to buy. It is not drying yet can give face a clean feel after washing. Price is good. The down side is the opening of tube is quite big hence each time might squeeze more than what is needed. I think this tube can finish up in a short period of time.

LANCÔME-Crème Mousse-Confort,,Squeaky clean,Love how foamy this Lancome cleanser is and helps to remove the makeup and debris from my skin without leaving the dry feeling. Will definitely not hesitate to repurchase this in future
LANCÔME-Crème Mousse-Confort,,not effective,Face dry after use. it shows dullness too. wonder what is this for . oily skin are not suitable and it does not clean very well. not recommended for oily skin.
LANCÔME-Crème Mousse-Confort,,Creamy and Rosy ,"Was looking for a cleanser to help combat my dry skin and was said this is a creamy one. Decided to give it a try and it does leave the skin moist. The rose smell isn’t very overpowering. But as for cleaning ability, I don’t see much difference I guess "

LANCÔME-Crème Mousse-Confort,USA,Simply the best!,It is very creamy almost like a milk cleanser but foams up so well. One of the best cleansers for dry and/or sensitive skin. It smells and feels luxurious! This is something I would think the price would be over $40 but for $25 it is a steal.
LANCÔME-Crème Mousse-Confort,USA,leaves my dry skin soft!,"My skin tends to get dry and flaky in the fall and winter (complete opposite in the summer when it's an oil slick), and my summer face wash gets to be too drying. The Creme-Mousse Confort has been my go-to face wash for my dry, flaky skin during those months. It's really moisturizing, while getting my skin clean, and sometimes I'll pair it with a Clarisonic to physically exfoliate. It has a really nice foam, is creamy white-pink in color, and has a rose scent! Definitely my go-to cleanser when my skin needs TLC!"

MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,10/10,"i’ve been using this cleanser for a couple weeks and it has drastically improved my skin. acne has decreased, and surface bumps are gone. my pores have also significantly decreased. in addition to this, a little goes a long way. less than the recommended dime sized amount covers my entire face."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,not for me,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received that as a sample. The first use was ok, but after a few uses, I realized that my skin became red with dry patches. I have sensitive skin. I assumed this is the wrong product for my skin."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Face feels clean and soft,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Let me start by saying I have completely neglected my skin during this pandemic. It was rough, uneven, splotchy, and dull. When I received the free sample of grapefruit face cleanser (and other products) by Malin + Goetz from Influenster I was skeptical that it could turn the state of my skin around. I am glad I was wrong because my skin is looking much, much better thanks to the full Malin + Goetz system I've used. The grapefruit face cleanser has a nice soft foam that doesn't strip away the natural oils of your face - so your skin doesn't feel dry/tight after you've used it. I have not used it to remove makeup, so I can't speak to that side of things, however, I have managed to get a bit of it in my eyes while rinsing it off and it doesn't exactly feel great... so I don't think I would use it to remove eye makeup. All in all, I really like it in combination with the detox mask and the vitamin e moisturizer."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Nice lightweight cleanser. Works well on my sensitive, eczema-prone skin. It smells exactly like grapefruit and is great for the summer months when you want something refreshing and light!"
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Great fresh cleanser for removing makeup!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really do love this cleanser. it removes all my make up and dirt from the day. I find that it is very light weight really refreshing and makes my skin look fresh and glowing. My fiancé claimed the product to be his and I need to purchase these to have in our household at all times now. It smells so good too! This is a great cleanser for dry to normal skin.
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product from my influenster sampler box and have been using this for over a month and it is great gentle cleanser. My face feels soo refreshed after using this and it doesn't pull or dry out my skin. I love the refreshing grapefruit smell that isn't super strong. It's great to use morning or night. And my skin had no sensitivities to it which is great.
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This was just an ok cleanser for me. I liked the thickness of it but it didn't leave my skin with that fresh clean feeling.
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Love!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) LOVE MALIN+GOETZ
I’m so happy they’re available in Canada.

I have sensitive skin and this didn’t cause any issues. The only thing is I would be careful to avoid your eyes. But that can be said with any cleanser or anything citrus generally. Left my skin feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. Definitely recommend."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I’m a fan of grapefruit, so right away I was excited to try this cleanser. Obviously if you’re not a fan of grapefruit the scent may not be for you. As for the cleanser itself, I found it to work pretty well and deep cleaning my skin without leaving it too tight or dry!"
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Not for combo sensitive skin,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Not a fan! Its too strong not gentle enough for my sensitive acne prone skin! It deeply cleanses my skin.
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Subtle scented cleanser,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Doesn’t leave skin feeling stripped which is nice.  Subtle scent but doesn’t leather as much as some cleansers.  Skin felt clean after though.
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Great cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It smells like citrus, makes skin feel very refreshed and smooth, awesome for an everyday use. I like that this cleanser does not dry out my skin after each use like many other cleansers do."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Approved,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Im really picky with cleansers, and this is definitely the one I was looking for, it cleans so gentle and it's scent is so good."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Citrusy, refreshing and gentle! Definitely a must have for my fellow oily skin girls. Great cleanser that doesn’t irritate my acne prone skin. Love the gel texture but still lathers well do give you that squeaky clean feeling at the end of the day. Definitely a must have!"
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I enjoyed this one quite a bit.

I love a good, thick cleanser and that’s what this felt like for me. 

I’m also a fan of a good lather and this hit the spot! Would totally buy it."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Didn’t work for me but my partner loved it.,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I am unsure whether this cleanser or the moisturizer was the culprit but one of these items didn’t mix well with my already established skin routine and left me with a mild chemical burn. Because I’m was not sure which product is at fault I gave both to my partner who hasn’t had any issues at all with either. The following is what we had to say about both.

“ I found them to be very gentle, and the moisturizer was easy to work into my skin, and didn’t leave a greasy residue feeling. The cleanser, like I said, was gentle, but it seemed to leave my face feeling clean which not all non-exfoliating cleansers do. The scent does need a little work, it’s not awful, but definitely has a plastic/chemical smell which might be more off putting to some. Neither products caused any irritation, or any blemishes.”

I gave this three stars because the smell was extremely noticeable with this product."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I was most nervous to try this product as is grapefruit and most citrus type products cause my skin to break out. With this product, my skin felt clean, and not stripped. I also really enjoyed the light smell. Will definitely use again in the future."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Very moisturizing lather!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product compliments  of Influenster and Malin+Gotez for review. I live in a cold climate and also have naturally dehydrated skin. Often cleansers feel like they are pulling moisture from my skin but this one was so plesant , not to mentioned smelled great! The citrusy grapefruit scent was great to help liven me up in the morning and although a clear gel the lather felt very moisturizing, and a little went a long way! Great value in this product. Even better when using with the other in this collection, This will definitely be a rebuy!"
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Invigorating!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Has a very pleasant, clean scent. Leaves my face soft and feeling refreshed."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I had high hopes, but didn’t end up loving this for my skin. I have fairly oily combination skin, but this was leaving me feel too dry. The scent isn’t my favourite either, but I’m not a huge lover of grapefruit smells. But it could completely be a favourite for another! I just prefer something else."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love the smell of this cleanser! I feel like it cleans my face really well and isn’t overly drying, but I do prefer cream cleansers given I have dry sensitive skin, especially for the cold seasons. I think this will be a good product for me to use once a day in summer!"
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,refreshing cleanser,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Honestly one of the most refreshing nice smelling cleansers I’ve used in a long time. No sticky residue makes your face feel super fresh and clean. My skin definitely cleared up a lot using this product will continue to use it.
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Light and refreshing! Nice mild scent and Gentle cleanser with no skin flare ups on my sensitive skin. Not a fan of the packaging, the cleanser somehow seems to leak from the top, even when closed."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Great for sensitive skin!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) One of the best cleansers I've ever used! Love the gel and how it makes my face feel! It didn't dry out my face like some cleansers do!
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love this cleanser! It’s a pricey splurge but will definitely be in my rotation. It has a nice light scent, doesn’t strip my skin and deep cleanses. The only issue is the squeeze tube.. please turn this into a pump!"
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,I will be using this for life,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I absolutely love this cleanser! After using it, it makes my face feel so fresh and clean. The bottle is quite big so it will last a while and personally I only need one pump max. I use it every night."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have dry skin so I was a bit worried this may dry my skin out but I was pleasantly surprised by this product! I feel like this cleanser is able to thoroughly clean my skin but it does not leave I feeling dry or stripped of moisture. 

I love the citrus, clean and fresh scent. If you have dry skin I definitely think this cleanser would be perfect for the spring and summer months as it is a nice gel cleanser that won’t leave your skin feeling uncomfortable or dehydrated but instead will leave your skin feeling refreshed"
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) One of my fave cleansers lately. Usually gel textures cleanses make my skin feel tight and dry but this one is perfect. It also cleanses off light makeup which is handy because I don’t always have the time to double cleanse.
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I adore this scent and find the formula is really effective at deep cleaning! My skin feels clean yet balanced after I use this. I was using it previously over the skin as a normal cleanser, but due to the very simple packaging I’ve found it’s best suited for my personally in the shower. That way if I squeeze out too much product (which definitely does happen with this bottle on occasion) I can use it to better clean around my hairline, down my neck and down my chest. Overall, really happy to have it and will enjoy using it to the end!"
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love this cleanser. It smells amazing and leaves my skin feeling so clean. My skin doesn’t always do well with new products but this has been amazing!!
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Squeaky clean cleanser,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) If you like that squeaky clean feeling this cleanser is for you! It removes makeup nicely as well. Liquid to gel formula makes the face feel nice and clean. Thank you @influenster for sending me this product to try!
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This cleanser is very refreshing especially if you enjoy citrus fragrance. It seems to work well with my sensitive porous face. I feel it would be better if they changed to a pump as a package so that we don’t squeeze out so much product
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I found this product a little to drying and it caused some Irritation on my skin. I absolutely love the smell! And the size for the value is incredible. I think it’s just meant for someone with a little more oily skin than mine.
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Didn't love this! It has a great scent but was much too light for me! Packaging also wasn't great as it always made me squeeze too much product out.
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I didn’t like it at all. I have oily skin and I felt this cleanser left my skin stripped and dry. My skin is left looking dull and grey. Washed out. Not hydrated at all. And while their site says a toner is not needed, I definitely found that my skin felt and looked better after I used a toner. You can find much better cleansers at this price point. I wouldn’t recommend it."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Wouldn’t recommend for sensitive eyes,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this cleanser through Influenster and I’m glad I had a chance to try it out and see what the hype is all about. Yes, this cleanser does have a natural grapefruit (citrus) scent...which has it’s pros and cons in my opinion. I love the scent personally, but the label specifically states that you should  avoid contact with eyes and flush your eyes if contact occurs. While I understand that the brand originated as a fragrance company, I find it a bit counterproductive to have irritants in a facial cleanser (in which you typically wash your eyes).  It does leave your skin soft and hydrated but I avoid my eyes while using it myself."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Great,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I’m not inlove with the scent but I also don’t loves citrus scents but it does leave your skin feeling great
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Great gel cleanser that is not drying,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a gentle cleanser that has a gel consistency and foams up nicely on the face. It does a really nice job getting rid of dirt and making the face feel clean and fresh. The grapefruit scent is nice but surprisingly sharp for me even though I really like the smell of citrus/grapefruit and don't usually mind fruity cleansers. All in all, it does a fantastic job, and I'd happily use it again."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Works good,"Works wonders for acne prone skin
This worked amazingly well for clearing up hormonal acne and preventing further breakouts. A must-have in my routine forever more! It also smells fab!"
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,refreshing,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Refreshing, smells great. skin feels clean but not stripped. I like this cleanser a lot, probably wouldn’t recommend for very dry skin though"
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Nice Everyday Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a nice cleanser that’s fairly gentle on the skin, I still have to use an eye makeup remover to get my eye makeup off and then this does the rest of the job really well.  I love the light scent of grapefruit too I’m a big fan of citrus smells."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Love this! Great for sensitive skin,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The subtle smell of grapefruit makes it so refreshing! A little goes a long way & I find myself reaching for this cleanser time and time again! Doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry and tight, just clean and refreshed! Love this for my sensitive skin!"
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Lightly scented and soft on the skin. Feels like it does a good job cleansing, easy to use daily"

MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Refreshing AF!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Honestly one of the most refreshing products I’ve tried recently. Doesn’t feel sticky on your face and leaves your skin feeling soft, fresh and smells amazing!"
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,"oily skin pps, I definitely recommend","(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is truly a great cleanser. I have never found a cleanser that I will say is amazing and have repurchased, but I think this is it! The smell is light and pleasant and the gel texture is nice. Great for my oily skin peeps because it foams up. My skin feels refreshed after using it, but a little too “squeaky clean” for my liking (hence the 4 star instead of 5). That feeling doesn’t last very long though so it’s not something that will deter me from using it. My skin is responding so well to this cleanser, I rarely get a breakout (especially during that time of the month) and my pores are much clearer! It is especially great if you follow up with their vitamin e moisturizer. My skin seriously looks amazing after using those two together. Despite wearing masks all day, I get compliments on my glowing skin... and that says something. I would use this morning more as a daytime cleanser because of the scent and the skin feel; it has that get up and go vibe. Thanks Influenster for allowing me to test this out, I’ve been on a long journey to find a cleanser I  really love."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Gentle Effective Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I like the clean, minimal aesthetic of the packaging.

I’m glad this didn’t smell like what I was anticipating. It’s actually a very nice natural scent.

It’s a good thick gel consistency and provides a nice lather. My skin feels clean and refreshed, with no stripped feeling.

This on it’s own, while a very effective cleanse, doesn’t seem to be controlling the more severe breakouts I’ve been having recently. However, combined with the Detox Face Mask twice weekly as directed, it’s a good combination for keeping things in check.

I’ve been using these for about a month now and overall my skin is clearer, with improved texture and tone. The very prominent pores on my cheeks have even become less noticeable.

*I received these products from Influenster in exchange for an honest review*"
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this cleanser as a freebie through Influenster and have been using it every night for over a month now.  I have combination skin that tends to be drier on the cheeks as I live in a very dry area. The cleanser is gel based, so it's very slippy. A little goes a long way with this product, with not even a dime sized amount, I was able to foam it up very well with my wet palms before applying to the face. It cleansed well, and especially because my skin can get dry easily, I found that after rinsing, my skin did not feel tight and felt very refreshingly clean. I think this cleanser is great for all skin types, and even after I rubbed it all over my face and eyes, it didn't sting the eyes at all when I opened them.  Recommend for anyone looking to try something new!"
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This cleanser does it’s job by leaving your face feeling clean without any added dryness. However, I wish it had a dispenser to make it easier to judge the amount your getting. I also didn’t hate the scent, but didn’t love it either."
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Malin + Goetz Grapefruit Face Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This face wash is a super gentle cleanser great for oilier or combination skin as it does foam up a bit. Super lightweight and fresh smelling, this cleanser helped balance my skin, reduce redness, breakout size and frequency. For my taste I preferred it as a morning cleanser as I usually like an exfoliating treatment at night, it was also gentle enough to use around my eyes. 
Thank you Influenster and Malin+Goetz for the products in exchange of"

MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Dries my skin,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It’s okay. I have used better cleansers. This dries out my skin a little bit. Not too great but the moisturiser balances it out. Smells good though

MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Does what a cleanser should do,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

It's a very lightweight gel cleanser that doesn't suck out moisture from your skin, which is what I've been looking for. I love the smell of grapefruit so the smell of this cleanser was really nice and not overpowering, very natural.

Scent is amazing, could use some acne fighting ingredients, but its become a staple in my routine and I would reccommend!"
MALIN + GOETZ-Grapefruit Face Cleanser,Canada,Fresh and light,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is my new goto morning cleanser.

SHISEIDO-Future Solution LX Extra Rich Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Best cleanse for mature skin,"A little goes a long way for this one, need to lather it for a bit and it’ll take off the grime and dirt on your face leaving it smooth and clean! Dont rush and take your time in washing it off. Skin is soft afterwards"
SHISEIDO-Future Solution LX Extra Rich Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Miss,"Super rich and dense foam that cushions my skin beautifully without overly stripping it of moisture. This is the simplest self-indulgence there is! And it has a light floral scent that's relaxing and not overpowering. If only it was more affordable or came in a jumbo pack (at better value), I would use it everyday and it would be the only cleanser I use! "
SHISEIDO-Future Solution LX Extra Rich Cleansing Foam,Singapore,repurchasing,It not only smells nice but also does perfect yet gentle cleansing. I use it at night after make up removal. It gives me sense of security that my face is clean without overly drying it. I have almost finished what I have on hand and feel glad that this product is sold in Sephora now! 
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,Singapore,Scrub Away,"I’ve a sudden inflammation acne skin due to wrong skincare product, so I need to find something basic to reset my skin. It does help to brighten my skin and it doesn’t feel dry after using it."
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,Singapore,Good ,"This is a very unique cleanser, I honestly feel like it's really extracting out all the dirt from my pores and giving my skin a deep cleanse. But, I still prefer a more foaming cleanser."
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,Singapore,not great,I thought it was pretty intriguing for the cleanser to be black but had breakouts the next day after using it and my face didn’t feel entirely clean after washing (not sure if it’s just me though)
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,Singapore,charcoal cleanser face wash,"One of the best cleansers ever used. Cleans the face well and not too drying. Keeps my face clean and clear. Amazing especially when it’s on sale. Can be quite costly though.
"
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,Singapore,frank,"You only need a teeny amount of this sticky syrup of a cleanser, which foams like crazy with water to come out the other side with squeaky=clean skin. The formula, made with"
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,Philippines,Great!,"Does its job of cleansing. Though it doesn’t lather up, I noticed that it can remove some makeup residue. My skin likes it! Would still like to try other cleansers as I prefer foamy ones but will definitely repurchase I can’t find anything better. "
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,Singapore,very gentle,"this is a very gentle face wash. it has a unusual scent at first but youll get used to it. it really did help calm my face down frm pimples. overall, good product 👍👍"
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,Singapore,Highly recommend ,"Such a nice product for sensitive, dry skin. It takes of all the makeup (even mascara!), doesn’t leave skin dry and never irritates. You won’t need much of this per use, so even the small size lasts months. "
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,Malaysia,Good,"Read the reviews before buying it. Got myself 2 tubes of this. It is kinda watery. Not that thick consistency but it does slightly lather up. It does remove make up. Overall, not a bad choice. "
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,Malaysia,ms,"LOVEEEEE. I’ve bought this like 4 times already and it’s amazing. I could actually feel the difference after washing my face. My skin feels so so clean and bouncy, not drying at all and soooo smooth. Cleans away everything without stripping moisture. "
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,Singapore,It works,It works on my oily skin ! bought this as it has charcoal and salicylic acid in it. would repurchase this. giving a 4 star as i find the packaging small but its right for travelling.  
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,Malaysia,Not a Fan ,Don’t really like the charcoal smell and doesn’t feel like it does anything. I only bought this because it contains salicylic acid for my black and white heads and acne. But don’t think it’s that great of a cleanser. 
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,Singapore,good ,Skin feels clean. Cleanser has no scent. Good for sensitive skin. Skin did not react adversely to it. Good as a basic cleanser. Good size for travel too. 
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,Singapore,Love this product,Not to heavy cleanser like other products. This is very light in scent and easy. Most of the time feel like no cleanser at all but actually after you wash off your face is really bright and smooth. 
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,Philippines,Frank body charcoal face cleanser,This face cleanser is skin friendly. It blends well on my skin and removes excess oil. I  let it stay on my face for at least 10 minutes before i rinse with water. It does not dry my skin and it makes my skin soft.
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,Singapore,good for everyday,"The cleanser has a slimy texture when using. but once it is rinsed off, it makes the skin feel smooth, clean, and balanced as in it does not feel dry. 
good for everyday use in this humid weather without feeling like the skin is stripped off of its natural oils. "
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,,smooth and clean ,Love this face cleaner for my dry combination skin I have huge pores it makes them look clean and slightly small reasonably priced a very good cleaner 
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,,My favorite face cleanser!!!,"It’s gentle but with enough cleansing effect! It doesn’t make your face dry. The charcoal smell is subtle and nice. I’ve bought it for myself so many times. Also, it’s a perfect gift bc it suits all skin types."
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,,2 in 1,I love this product! I have combination skin and this face cleanser makes my skin feel so clean without drying coz  the creamy texture make my skin more hydrate. 
FRANK BODY-Charcoal Face Cleanser,,it's OK ,It's OK. Not the best cleanser I've used. I have dehydrated skin and this feels a little drying for me but it really cleanse well. So I don't use it everyday. I only use it when I feel like my skin is super oily and clogged with dirt after a long day and really need a good cleanse. 
PAI SKINCARE-Light Work Rosehip Fruit Extract Cleansing Oil,New Zealand,Quite nice but not quite right,"I do love how it leaves your skin feeling fresh and hydrated/not fully stripped of its own naturally produced goodness. However I am often left feeling its maybe a bit too ""filmy"" and not cleansing/clean enough - though when I tone afterwards it's obvious it has cleaned my skin. For now I am enjoying this product but can see myself being tempted to switch it up or getting over the filmy feeling. "
PIXI-Hydrating Milky Cleanser,Singapore,hydrating,Bought this for my partner as he has dry skin and doesn’t really spend much time on skincare. Surprised with the benefits of this considering it is at a reasonable price. It really does hydrate very dry skin. 
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Singapore,prefer the detox version ,"This doesn't do much for me. In fact, I feel the detoxifying cleanser (black bottle) purifies more than this one. Also, it might be too harsh for me as my skin reddens after usage. "
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,good product and feel so clean,Feel very clean and fresh after cleansing. Don’t need to apply large amount because it is quite thick texture. So mix with water n rub so to get more foam. Second purchase and will buy again. Worth a try! Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Great cleanser but packaging is meh,"I really enjoyed the consistency of this cleanser. It’s not overly drying for a gel cleanser. Foams beautifully too. This did not cause any breakouts and kept my skin quite clear too. Only downside is that the pump is not easy to use, it gets stuck quite frequently. As a result, I’ll need to “yank” the pump back up."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Singapore,Love it!,"Cleanse, purify, and soothe skin with sulfate-free Purifying Cleansing Gel. Nourishing botanicals leave skin thoroughly cleansed, soothed, and protected from free radical damage without over-drying or stripping the skin. Complexion is left looking healthy and refined."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Singapore,fresh face,"this is good, definitely gentle, tried as a more posh alternative to the dermalogica clear line - it's definitely a good clean without stripping your skin but I don't think it's as good at preventing/clearing breakouts "
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,no longer available :(,My favorite face wash. Why don’t you sell it anymore?
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,New Zealand,great product! ,"Loves this! Such a fresh feeling cleanser. Great antibacterial properties that left my face feeling so clean! Would recommend a gentle moisturizer after use, as it did tend to cleanse EVERY last drop of moisture from my skin lol I used Avery last drop of this and will definitely buy again! "
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Australia,Good but not worth the money doesn't do what it claims,"I do like this product and it feels wonderful putting it on. It leaves the skin feeling clean and soft. Apart from that I don't beleve this it does what it claims to do. i have used most if it up now. I apply it day and night and my skin hasn't shown signs of improvement. I like it but it's a basic cleanser that's all. If you like your skin feeling fresh and rejuvenated then I do recommend, it's not a bad product. Also if you have good skin already then that's when I would recommend this product as I believe will maintain that. "
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Miss,It is one of my favourite cleaner. I have a sensitive skin and non stop pimples. I used at night mostly. It is super gentle and I can feel the skin is completed clean  when I forgotten to remove my sunblock by applying makeup removal. I will buy it again! 
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Staple,"I love this cleanser so much. Started with the Clear Complexion cleanser but since Sephora has stopped stocking that, I switched to this. No regrets. I actually prefer this! I have combination, sensitive and breakout-prone skin, and this suits me fine. Foaming but skin doesn’t feel “stripped” after washing. Gentle enough even around the eye area and doesn’t break me out. Price is steep but worth it if you have a simple routine"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Nice foam,"This foams like crazy and for someone who loves foam cleansers, this is a dream. The scent is quite strong but not off putting. 

The only qualm i have with this product is that the dispenser nozzle can come off really easily, but it is an easy re-installation. I use this as a second cleanse after bobbi brown’s gentle oil. This cleanser gets rid of the oil from that, but does not leave the skin feeling stripped. 

Ref: i have dry skin, slight wrinkles around the eyes. In my 30s. 

I recommend this product. An alternative is the dr jart’s foaming cleanser. Similar results. 
"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,love,i love this one but im confused. is it discontinued or they just change the packaging? i bought the new one in white bottle but didnt get the same vibe as this one. but its a good non irritative cleanser. non stripping and nice foam. plus point because of the pump dispenser
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Australia,"Pricey, but lasts","When I first came across this product I was a bit worried about the price of such a tiny bottle, but it took me 7 months to use - and I wash my face at least once a day! It doesn't leave your skin feeling tight or too dry and is only the 2nd product that I've found that helps with my sensitive, acne prone skin. Now if they would just restock so I can buy and buy and buy, I would give it 5 stars"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Good Cleanser,"This cleanser does what it claims- remove th excess sebum but does not dry out skin. At first I thought the amount is quite little consider its cost, but actually you don't need to use much product to cleanse the face, a little goes a long way. Also it does not have any fragrance at all. "
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,great product,"Bosciq purifying cleansing gel.. i would say it’s a great product, i’m not too picky on cleansing product, as long as it does the job, not drying or make my face feel tight after cleansed. Yes the price is a lil pricey to be honest, not sure i’ll repurchase in the future."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,refreshing ,"Have been eyeing on this purifying cleansing gel for some time and finally put my hands on it! 
No doubt it’s generous with the amount of gel at such reasonable price! The gel is okay for me as I’m a combination skin and doesn’t have blemishes or acne, it worked pretty well. "
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Love it,I love this cleanser. I have been using if for about a year now and have had no problems.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Amazing!,"I was skeptical of this face wash as I didn't think it would address my acne. However, I am so impressed! It has improved my acne and improved my skintone. I'm 36, trying to slow the aging of my skin, plus deal with pesky hormone related acne so I always struggle to find an effective yet not too harsh product. This is great! I will add that when I started using this facewash, I also started using a Rencare serum but I do think this product has played a role in my improved skin."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Singapore,Ms,It's lightly foaming and best used as a second cleanser (after remove makeup). But I don’t understand why did they change the package colour. What’s the difference between white and green? 
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Australia,Works well for oily skin,"Lovely creamy lather, excellent to use for removing makeup on the rare occasions I wear it. Definitely for combination to oily skin, too stripping on my combination to dry. Don't need to use much each time, so the bottle takes 2 or 3 months to get through"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Australia,Excellent !,"It gently cleanse your skin and does not leave you skin dry.  Your skin will feel purified and soothed 
A nice amino acid cleanser that I've purchased twice and definitely will buy it again,"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,cleansing and not drying!,"I’ve had this cleanser for a little over one week now, and I am very impressed. It has a thin-like consistency and smells very strong. It foams up alittle bit and is very gentle on the skin. I bought it because I was experiencing super dry skin from the change of seasons and it has managed to keep my skin clean without stripping it. Leaves my skin soft and I will keep on using. Would recommend!"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Australia,Really disappointed,The gel does turn into a foam so at least it does what it says it will do. Unfortunately it has been really drying to my fairly normal skin and has resulted in what feels like flaky skin. Further it sticks to baby hairs around the hair line and destroys them. 
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Good cleanser but not for dry skin,Overall a good cleanser. It gets my makeup off and the gentle foam feels nice. I’m taking one star off as it’s supposedly a product for all skin types but I probably would not use this if you are dry—would be a five star product for normal to oily skin. It’s definitely not as stripping as sulfate based foaming cleansers but it’s not quite as gentle as advertised. I do notice my face feeling tight after using this as my skin gets more dry in the fall and winter. I tried this because in the evenings I do enjoy the lather of foaming cleansers and always on the hunt for a foaming cleansers that isn’t stripping. However this just isn’t it.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,"This is great for oily or combo skin. It doesn’t make me breakout, it’s gentle on the skin and makes my skin feel really clean after using with a face scrubbing brush."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Best cleanser I've tried so far,"I've used this cleansing gel for the past two years and it is perfect for sensitive skin, helps remove makeup and is also great for oily skin. This product is a must have in my beauty routine."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Got more blackheads in one week((,"I bought it for my morning and evening routine, also to reduce blackheads. I read reviews and asked consultant in the store, if this product going to help keep my skin clean. I have normal skin and have some not really visible blackheads on my nose. Now, after using it for one week and have more blackheads than I ever had in my life, even on cheeks. Will return it today."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,broke me out,"was super excited to try this, but I was disappointed that it foamed up. Thought it was a gel. Not sure if it was the fragrance or foaming, but it made my face irritated. I later got terrible cystic breakouts with this:/"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,The smell is mild and my face feels refreshed after using it!
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Great for dry or sensitive skin,Love this cleanser so much! Great for dry skin and has really helped with my acne. Also Costco some times had it for $7-$12 so i grab a couple when i see them there. Also really good for my daughter who has eczema and really sensitive skin.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,good product,Love this product it is my go to daily cleanser.  I would give it 5 stars but the price is a bit too high for a cleanser
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Deep Cleansing,"I received a free sample of this and was shocked at how great it was. It foams and I wasn’t expecting that, but the bubbles feel like a deep cleanse on my face. This stuff is great. I wish it was back in stock..."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Gentle Cleanser,"I've tried so many face cleanser through these years, this is the gentlest one that I've ever used! It doesn't strip my skin and it is really great for the second cleanse purpose. I use a makeup cleansing balm/oil first to remove all my makeup & sunscreen, then, use this. And also the best thing is, it doesn't hurt my eyes when i am rubbing it all over face literally. Most of the cleansers do that :( Anyways, I like this product! :)"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,not for people who wear makeup,This cleanser did nothing for me. Left makeup on my skin/eyes. I always had to use multiple pumps just to get my foundation off. No exfoliate in it. My pores still felt clogged after use. If you want something extremely gentle with no fragrance this is for you. Best for someone who does not wear a lot of makeup.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Best cleanser I've tried in a lonngggg time,"I absolutely love this cleaner. I purchased when I was having issues with perioral dermatitis, as it claimed to be gentle. Not only does it not aggravate my skin, I never feel dry and tight after washing. My skin feels soft and smooth. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I don't feel it removes makeup very well, so I prefer to use it in the morning."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Gentle cleanser,Good cleanser that has a calming subtle scent! Didn't break me out or excessively dry me out. I do wish it was a few dollars cheaper
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Clean and effective!,I really like this wash. its very light yet cleans so deep! you can tell there are no harsh chemicals. This also removes my makeup with little effort. Wish it wasnt out of stock!
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,perfect,"this is the best cleanser I've ever used, and I've tried a lot. I have sensitive acne prone skin, and this didn't irritate or break me out. very thick rich lather gets skin extra clean."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,New style,"Is anyone else upset at the new style of packaging? I've used this product for nearly 5 years and has been my one and only cleanser, I don't really care for packaging in general as long as the product works, but boscia's original style had a special place in my heart. Regardless of the packaging I will continue to use this cleanser because it has always worked efficiently in my oily and acne prone face and still all boscia products. Just wanted to know if other boscia lovers felt the same way."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Love it!,"I was using the therma black cleanser, which I honestly do like better than this one but this cleanser is amazing as well. I have very acne prone sensitive, oily combo skin and it works so well at cleansing, not drying my skin out and keeping the acne at bay. definitely recommend!"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Australia,good,"I’ve been using this product faithfully for about 3 years now and it’s perfect. The smell in the morning helps me wake up and my skin is brighter and more even. The times I haven’t used it (because I didn’t order a new one in time), there was a noticeable difference in my skin appearance and feel. This is worth the money."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Singapore,Clean and fresh ,"This is my favourite cleanser. I have dry and sensitive skin, some gentle cleanser doesn't clean well. This cleanser can clean well without feeling tight. Leaves my skin soft without stripping the moisture."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,a bit drying for combination skin,"I definitely feel a deep cleanse when I use this cleansing gel (I've tried gentler cleansers like the soy cleanser from Fresh but it felt a little too gentle), but this is a bit too drying for my combination skin. I have a drier skin towards my temples and on my cheeks, so whenever I use this cleanser the skin tends to peel in those areas, and I feel itchy. It doesn't cause any breakouts thankfully, but it's just not good enough for my skin type."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,"Very nice morning cleanser, not drying at all after wash, one pump is good for full face, gentle but able to remove all the grease."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Nice gentle cleanser,"I love this cleanser. It's perfect for double cleansing but also on its own. It cleanses your skin nicely without the feeling of dryness afterwards. However, I'm still looking for a cheaper version of this because it is expensive!"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Singapore,Mrs,"Cleanses well and gentle on my sensitive skin. Smells great, not overpowering. Gel-like texture and foams up well with wet hands and face. Just needs an almond size amount for whole face. Keeps skin moisturized. Took half a star off for the price as the bottle is a tad small. Other than that, love it!"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,"Gentle, good for a double cleanse","This is really gentle, no insane reactions. I use this as the second cleanse for the double cleansing system. Not stripping and cleans the face well. 

When the product is almost out, I toss it in my gym bag and rebuy another bottle for regular use."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Australia,Love this cleanser!,"I use this everyday and it is such a good everyday cleanser. Definitely feels like it cleans your skin but make sure you moisturize after washing your face as it does do a good job of cleaning the face (and stripping the natural oils away). Not a strong horrible scent and 1-2 pumps is all you need, a little goes a long way :) "
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Amazing,Been using this cleanser for 4ish years and have never had a problem. I have super dry but also acne prone skin and this is the perfect product because it doesnt suck the moisture out of ur skin. 10/10 recommend
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Broke me out BAD,"I decided I really wanted to focus on my skincare routine during quarantine so I bought this face cleanser to start me off. I'm 26 and only usually get a breakout here and there. I started using this cleanser and within 2 weeks I developed full on acne all over my cheeks. I've never experienced anything like it. I know the cause has to be this cleanser because I hadn't yet incorporated anything different than I had been using prior into my skincare routine, and my diet, period, etc has all stayed the same. I stopped using it just for just under a week now and haven't seen any new breakouts, thank goodness. Will not be using this again. So disappointed."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Love!,Love it! My skin always feels so fresh and clean after using it.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,A fresh morning must-have,"This cleanser had me at hello. I was amazed by this product from the first time of using. The texture is so gentle and generates foam quick, nice and smooth. I have a dry-oil in the central combination skin. This face wash makes me feel so clean and refreshing without any dry feeling after wash. I have my fresh morning start from washing face everyday!"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Great amino acid surfactant cleanser,"Amino acid based face cleansers generally are gentle to natural skin barrier and natural moisturizing factors (filaggrin). I tried the Fresh soybean cleanser (200 mL) which is also amino acid based, but personally I prefer Boscia due to its richer foam. I usually use it after makeup remover at night. It washes away the remover and makeup residue nicely."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,Have been using this cleanser for many years. I like the unscented ingredients.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Great but slightly drying,"I have normal-dry sensitive skin that gets a few blemishes and have some texture on my forehead. This cleanser gets rid of the texture and blemishes within a few days of using. 
It mixes well and the scent isn't over powering. It leaves skin feeling clean and looking brighter. Also no redness or rashes.
4 stars because it is a bit drying and leaves skin feeling a bit tight."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,My HG <3,"Someone in Sephora's live chat recommended this to me along with the cleansing oil since my main issue was finding a cleanser to suit my oily skin. I can't express how glad I am to have this product because it changed my skin for the better after using this continuously for one week. My face feels clean and rid of the oiliness I wake up to in the mornings or build up throughout the day up until it's time for my nightly skincare routine. It's also a great compliment with the cleansing oil that I use if I have a full face of makeup, and I can honestly say my skin's never been this clear. I do have to agree with some reviews that have said it dried out their skin, despite having oily skin myself the area around my mouth and chin became extremely dry and white. Personally I don't mind it since I smooth on my moisturizer afterwards and the problem's solved, but I'd advise those with dry patches to be cautious when using this product and to follow up with moisturizer immediately afterwards. So glad I stocked up on this product for quarantine because I've never been more in love with my skin up until I started using this product daily."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,"I pair this cleanser with Boscias make up remover oil. First i take off my make up with a wipe, apply oil and finish with the cleanser. They work the best together. The cleanser didn’t dry out my skin like most cleansers do and skin was soft after!"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Australia,miss,"Great product I’ve used for many years, it is quite good to sensitive skin and clean very well for daily. It is a foaming amino acid cleaning gel, very gentle and because of the foam, it seems stronger than the other amino acid cleanser. While I still recommend to use soap base cleanser 1-2 times a week, as I felt like it still not as powerful as the soap base cleanser. "
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,New Zealand,love this cleanser! ,Great for dry-combination skin! My skin can get quite dry with cleaners but this one doesn’t dry out my skin. Leave of feeling clean and smooth. Lasts me 4-5 months as well so great value for money! 
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,Face feels so clean after use. Also I love the minimal scent.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,drying!!,After a few days of use my face started feeling extremely dry.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,"I would give it 5 stars for the gel as it is light and it washes off makeup easily. However, I would give zero stars for the pump dispenser. This is the probably the fourth bottle I’ve gone through. The first two were completely fine. The last two bottles I bought the dispense does not stay on. It would just fall off if I didn’t grab it by the bottle, or the pump dispenser would just get knocked off. I do not understand why this is."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Great cleanser!!!,"Great cleanser, another good product from Boscia!! This leaves your skin super clean and refreshed without It feeling stripped."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,Holy grail cleanser! Always leaves a deep clean feeling but never leaves me feeling tight or uncomfortable.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,PERFECT for my dry and sensitive skin!!,"Let me start off by saying that my skin type is complicated. I have extremely dry, slightly sensitive skin, but large pores around the center of the face. My skin is not necessarily acne prone, but it will break out if I don't take care of it well. A good cleanser is extremely important for me to get my skin squeaky clean, but many ""purifying"" cleansers out there are too drying for me. The gentle cleansers aren't enough for me. I have been switching around cleansers for years trying to find one that will perfectly suit my skin and this is it for me! I've been using this for the past 6 months and it has helped my skin so much! I use it only at night (I have a different gentle cleanser for the morning, but this would work for the morning too) and my skin is left feeling squeaky clean, but balanced! My skin doesn't feel tight and dry as it had before with other cleansers. I also love that it doesn't have too many additives and fragrances like other cleansers. It creates a perfect lather with my Foreo Luna device. I'm currently on my second bottle of this and I know that I will continue to use this for years to come!"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,"A little definitely goes a long way when it comes to this product. The box recommends 1-2 pumps per wash but I’d say half a pump does the job just fine! It lathers within seconds and leaves skin feeling squeaky clean. I will say though, that the face does get a bit dry after washing, so I’d recommend using a good quality moisturizer afterwards. If you suffer from acne, prepare for your skin to purge, purge and purge. I’m on my fourth day of use with this product and I don’t think I’ve seen a purge this crazy. Boscia gets it DONE."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Don’t recommend,Didn’t see any after effect or result. Will not buy again. Will look for something different.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Makeup gone!,"Love this face wash - feels gentle yet gets all my makeup off, including heavy eye makeup quickly without rubbing! I use a toner sometimes afterwards and I’ve noticed a cleaner cotton pad than with other cleansers. It’s definitely pricey though."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,perfect match for combination skin,"I absolutely love this cleanser. I was using a creamy one that made me break out worse than ever before and since switching to this one a few weeks ago it’s a world of difference. My skin tends to be very dry in the winter and this cleanser doesn’t dry me out, but I definitely recommend following with a good moisturizer."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,"Well I love the smell of it! So gentle, so pleasant"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,this is my new favorite,"A little goes a long way! There isn’t an intense or chemical fragrance which I love. It becomes super sudsy, easy to wash off and leaves skin soft and clean!"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,,Miss,"Love it, the best cleansing gel. I used twice a day, morning and night, it was so clearing after used it. But the skin will feel a little bit dry. It is my second time repurchase it.

"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,happily surprised :),i received this as a gift in a set with the makeup remover oil
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,best for blemish-prone skin,"I can’t use any other cleanser! I have slightly oily skin that tends to break out easily. Im 33, but still struggle with blemishes & breakouts - particularly around the time of a period. with this cleanser, I have significantly fewer breakouts- most months I prevent them all together! Anytime I try out a new cleanser, I pretty quickly get a blemish pop up. I guess I’m using this cleanser until they stop making it (which is hopefully never)!"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,"great product if you like that ""squeaky clean"" feel."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,I use this after removing my makeup with Boscia cooking makeup-breakup. I ❤️ this cleanser. Been use if for almost 2 months. My skin looks clear and my pores definitely shrunk. Will continue to use. So happy I found a brand that works for my skin.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,I have oily skin and have used all types of cleansers to no avail. Saw this product on special and decided to give it a try and I have not regretted. It controls oil production (before this product my face would be oily all over just 2 hours after watching) and people have told me my skin glows.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Love this,"I love this cleanser. I have sensitive dry skin after going on accutane years ago and have always had trouble finding a cleanser that made my face feel clean but also didn't leave it feeling stripped and tight. This does it for me - after a lot of time back and forth between Fresh cleanser, drugstore ones, and many others, this does the trick. I tried the Charcoal version and it was drying for me. I am going to continue to use this. Also, a little goes a long way; it is rich and foamy."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,"I love the feel of the product when using and it leaves my skin super clean without over drying. It has a clean, light fragrance and a little goes a long way. I got it as a sample and immediately bought the full size."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,,great gel,this product is very gentle， but my face is soft and clean after using it. it's also foamy but easy to rinse off. definitely like to add to my favourite.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,,Miss,"Favourite cleanser so far. I’ve got somewhat sensitive skin and this is strong enough to remove residual makeup and oils but gentle enough for me to use morning and night without issue. Leaves my face soft, cleansed and ready for the rest of my routine. "
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,I always use this as a first step in my skin care routine. Easy to use and breaks down all my makeup making my skin care routine much easier!
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,"This face wash is amazing! You need very little, like half a pump, to cover your entire face. It leaves your face feeling clean and smooth, it doesn't dry out my skin unlike other face washes i have tried. 10/10"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,Really really like this cleanser! It helps a lot with redness! Doesn’t do much for treating or preventing acne but it is a nice gentle cleanser to use underneath other acne products.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,UNITED STATES /CANADA,I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT! MY SKIN IS PERFECT ! I USE EVERYDAY!
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,This cleaner is AMAZING! It leaves my skin feeling so fresh and clean without drying or over moisturizing. Will definitely become my new favorite face cleaner.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,a miracle product!,worth every penny -- I don't think I can live without this now. never have I used a product that instantly made my skin clearer! leaves my face clean and clear and SOFT and usually washes away all traces of makeup. even gentle enough to rub off my eye makeup without irritation. it's been 2 weeks since buying this and my skin looks better than it ever ever has.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,favorite cleanser,"I've been using this cleanser for five years and I absolutely love it. I have oily skin and am prone to breakouts, but this keeps both of those at bay. this keeps my skin balanced and clean! I've gone through many bottles and always have backups in storage."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Not for me,This wasn't the worst wash ever but did not impress me at all. So many better options. Returned
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,"Didn’t like this product! I have dry, textured, red skin and I was really excited about this but I found it literally does nothing. The only thing I’ve noticed from using this is that it has made my skin even rougher and bumpier. It didn’t really leave me with that “squeaky clean” feeling either. Not worth the price for a product that doesn’t do much! It does smell nice though. I ended up returning it."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Gentle yet effective foaming cleanser. Clean ingr,This is a wonderful gentle cleanser that is effective and also has clean ingredients. A small amount goes a long way and the bottle lasts me about 4 months. Love it and worth the money. Does not sting my eyes or dry out my skin yet cleans and has nice foaming action. Highly recommend. The scent is also light and not even noticeable.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,my new everyday cleanser,"I got a travel size of this with points and started using it when I ran out of the Fresh Soy Cleanser, and I'm buying a full-size now. I never thought I'd say this, but I like it better than the Fresh Soy Cleanser (blasphemy!). It does a better job taking off my makeup and I like the way my skin is looking."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,sensitive/acne prone skin,Really good cleanser! I have SUPER sensitive acne prone skin and i have 0 problems. dont overdry my skin. good ingredients and dont leave residues. TRY IT!
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,LOVE OF MY LIFE,"This cleanser was just what I was looking for. I have oily skin and I'm prone to having break out of ache, this baby does the trick. it's so easy to put on and clean off. It makes my skin feel so smooth and radiant. I really have seen the difference in using this compared to other cleansers that just weren't as strong. my ache is completely gone, but I do get little baby bumps here and there."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,Great face wash. Works well and I enjoy using clean beauty skin product.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Clean skin!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Stop what your doing right now....and go buy this cleanser!! I have been in the skin care
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,"I have sensitive combination skin and this is perfect for washing daily. It doesn't dry my skin out at all, and after only a few weeks my skin looks great and no new breakouts. It's not strong enough to remove heavy makeup, but I don't really wear any. Those occasions I will use a makeup remover first."
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,Canada,Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel,One of the best cleansers I’ve used. Makes my skin feel so clean and soft.
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,USA,BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA!,"Bring back the old formula!!! The old formula (white bottle) was my ride or die cleanser for many years. One pump removed all of my makeup, including waterproof mascara. The new formula (green bottle) does not remove my makeup at all and feels very thin. I am using 2-4 pumps with the new formula and still have mascara smeared under my eyes. Please bring back the old formula!"
BOSCIA-Purifying Cleansing Gel,,ms,"Best cleaner for the normal to dry skin! Have been using this one for years.
It is the American markets product of fancel which is especially for dry and sensitive skin!
Good functional product with reasonable price!"
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Australia,not my jam ,Bought this after seeing the great reviews. Didn’t like the way it felt on my skin almost silicon like and didn’t see any benefits from the retinol. Gave up on it after two weeks I would save the money if I were you 
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Malaysia,Smooth & Glow,I love this cleanser. Make my skin smooth and glow after cleanse. The texture is creamy and no foam but no foam for sure. Looking forward to try other retinol series.
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Singapore,face doesnt feel dry,"Mildly scent with jasmine, still ok for me. For those who doesnt like fragrance or jasmine scent, then probably not so suitable. Face doesnt feel dry after cleansing. Ok for frequent cleansing."
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Singapore,okay,decent cleanser not sure if i have benefited from the retinol benefits from this wash
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Malaysia,too creamy,Dont like the texture. Too creamy and doesn't clean my face at all. Suitable as 2nd wash. Too pricy for this item that dont clean enough my face. Not going to repeat purchase it in the future
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,New Zealand,lovely cleanser,"The actual product itself smells and feels beautiful on the skin. My face feels clean and recharged after using. My only issue is the tube it is in, it feels very cheap and can be quite difficult to squeeze the product out without having to bang it on your hand. "
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Singapore,Oily product,"Will not repurchase again, feels face is still oily after use. Smell was average otherwise. But definitely will not buy againnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn"
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Singapore,Don’t buy if you have oily skin,"Would not recommend this product if you have oily skin. This cleanser claims to have a moisturising effect after wash, but skin feels oily after using the product. Can’t tell if I’m getting a good cleanse."
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Malaysia,Its gonna be awesome!,This is my second time purchased retinol but from other brand before. I am at the age of needed to apply retinol at almost my mid 20s. Waiting for my current cleanser to finish and excitedly to try this one!
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Singapore,Smelly cleanser,"Not foamy, does it’s job I suppose? Foul or smelly cleanser that I cannot wait to rinse off after applying on my face. Leaves oily sensation after rinsing. Wont purchase again definitely."
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Malaysia,I can see the difference ,"Different people have different skin type. My skin sometimes can be too oily and dry. I have tried other skincare product, I think they doesn't suit me.  This is my first time using Pixi, and I TOTALLY fell in love with it. This product really suit me. "
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Malaysia,Ms ,"This is my 2nd purchase. OMG, I really love my skin after using this facial. I did review of this product before try and worried if this product not suitable for my acne skin. But my expectations is wrong, this cleanser work so well with my skin. No new pimples and my skin look glowing after use this. This is really recommended product."
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Singapore,Great product,Love this cleanser because its not drying and keeps my face plump & bright. This is my second purchase & got the retinol essence to go with it…. Can’t wait to try it together!!
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Australia,smells good,"This feels nice on the skin, nice and creamy and leaves my face feeling hydrated. Doesn’t cause any breakouts. The only thing is it isn’t very “powerful”, if I’m wearing make up, I will need to double cleanse. I will now only use it if I’ve worn no make up. Price is good for the size of the tube you get!"
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Singapore,just okay,Nothing much to shout about for this cleanser. Not drying on my skin but don’t feel as well cleansed. Not so pleasant scent as well despite I’m a jasmine scent lover.
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Malaysia,good cleanser,I love this cleanser and it doesn’t cause breakouts on my skin and doesn’t make my skin dry. It has fresh smell and good texture. I will definitely repurchase this cleanser
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Malaysia,worth buying ,I love this Retinol jasmine Cleanser smell is not bad .I’m using  this since last 6 months . My skin feels soft and smooth no side effects at all . I m dry skin type . 
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Australia,good product,"I guess I am in the ""mature"" skin category now *sigh* so I have to find appropriate cleansers that meet my needs.  This is a great cleanser that I thought I might try, thick and creamy with a nice jasmine scent.  It makes your skin feel clean without feeling dry.  I found that other cleansers for a comparable price work better for me though"
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Singapore,do not like the smell,"Hydrating but I really don’t like the smell of this cream, nothing Jasmine at all.

3 stars due to the smell.

After all, if you don’t mind the weird smell, it is not a bad choice for the reasonable price.
"
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Singapore,"Creamy, soothing cleanser ","Comforting cleanser that goes on creamy and washes off without stripping skin dry - some people might not like it as it feels like it leaves a film instead of leaves you squeaky clean but I love it, it feels lux!"
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,New Zealand,Love 💕 ,I’m not one for cream cleansers usually but I purchased this because I couldn’t find the green pixi cleanser that I usually buy. I do like this a lot though. 
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Malaysia,not suitable if use together with foreo,This cleanser is not suitable if use together with foreo. I put a lot on the top of the foreo but seems like i didnt put anything on my face. I think because it is a gel type cleanser. But it does make my face smooth & radiant.
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Malaysia,best,"Bau jasmin y wangi,

PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Malaysia,Great Value Cream Cleanser ,The smell is good and my skin glow after the first cleanse. I use it in the evening for double cleanse after removing make up / sunblock. It removes the excess oil on my T-zone. I’ve been using retinol at night so this is actually a perfect combo for my skin. 
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Singapore,good product ,"First time trying this to take a short break from my usual cleanser. The first time I used it, I wasn’t a fan of the scent but it’s quite subtle and I got used to it after a few washes and I think the scent is ok in the end. It’s a decent cleanser and cleanses my face really well - it also helps to remove make up on my face rather well. "
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Australia,Amazing,"Okay, the product for one smells amazing but doesn't have a lot of fragrance so it isn't sensitizing at all. My skin doesn't feel squeaky clean and stripped after using it, but it does get out all the makeup and excess sebum from my pores. My fine lines look visibly fainter. It is just an amazing product in general. Would recommend! "
PIXI-Retinol Jasmine Cleanser,Australia,decent ,A moisturising cleanser that is easy on the skin however the scent is nothing like Jasmine flower. Decent buy with nice packaging but nothing to fawn over. 
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Singapore,Favorite cleanser!,this cleanser work so well on my sensitive & dry skin! it doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight after washing and i love how soft it’ll make my skin feel. highly recommend if you’re looking for a good and gentle cleanser! 
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Singapore,Gentle cleanser that thoroughly cleanses your skin,"Doesn’t leave your skin feeling dry after washing even though it’s relatively gentle. I’ve always preferred foamy cleansers to gel based cleansers because I tend to have oilier skin than others, but this cleanser does help remove the excess oil and leaving my skin really clean and yet it doesn’t feel dry. "
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Singapore,Alies,Veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeryyyyyyyyyy gooood product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Singapore,Doesn’t give me the squeaky clean feel,My first tube of cleanser from Allies of the Skin and I am a bit disappointed by the texture and after-wash feeling on the skin. It takes about two washes to make my skin feel clean. Maybe this product is not meant to be for me.
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Singapore,Cleanser,"This cleanser works well for my sensitive skin. I use this as my morning cleanser. No redness and tightness after using. It has no scent which I prefer for skincare products. Gel texture is easy to lather. Minus 1 star for the price but overall, a good cleanser! "
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Australia,AMAZING FOR DRY SKIN,I essentially have a damaged skin barrier… this cleanser has helped my skin feel so good & not over stripped every time I’ve used it. Pricey but definitely worth it with all the ingredients 
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Singapore,morning cleanser,A great cleanser for the morning routine. So gentle and leaving my skin feeling hydrated. I enjoy massaging lightly with this cleanser without fear of drying out the skin. Sets the right tone for the morning routine. 
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Singapore,My Holy Grail ,"My daily go to cleanser .  Very gentle and hydrating to the skin . It definitely doesn’t dry up my skin . Despite the steep price , will still repurchase . "
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Singapore,Gentle cleanser,2nd repurchase of this cleanser! Do keep it mind that it does not foam up like usual cleanser. But it still cleanses perfectly and I love that it’s super gentle and that you can remove light makeup with this too.
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Singapore,Luxurious buy ,"Skin felt really nice and silky right after using it. However, does not really do much when there is a breakout. Good for daily use as a gentle cleanser but the only downside is the price tag is a bit too steep. "
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Singapore,nice but expensive ,It is a nice cleanser to use for dry skin and it lasted me longer than I expected. But the price is really too expensive for a cleanser. May not re purchased. 
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Singapore,fair good,this cleanser is not as foamy as I expected but it cleanses well. not worth of the high price tag since many cheaper cleansers can cleanse as well too.
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,New Zealand,Gentle and effective,I adore this cleanser. I use it on dry skin as a makeup remover and then on moist skin to cleanse. It has a luxurious silky feel and is so gentle and effective. This is going to be a constant for me.
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Singapore,Decent cleanser,"I wanted to give Allies of Skin a try but most of the products are super expensive, so I thought I would give this cleanser a go. I'm typically on the hunt for hydrating cleansers that don't strip my skin, and I was intrigued by the consistency of this product! After trying it for a few months, it does strip my skin a little bit and I don't see anything much different in my skin so I don't think I'll repurchase again. "
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Malaysia,love it ,At first I use this as an usual cleanser and nothing surprises me. It function just like the other cleanser. Until I notice this cleanser can use on a dry face as a remover and things change.  
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Australia,LOVE,I suffer from sensitive skin and rosacea and this cleanser has been wonderful for my skin. It feels luxurious on the skin and is effective at removing makeup.
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Singapore,Pretty awesome ,I love this cleanser. It’s not drying or too harsh. I’ve combination skin that is sensitive and tends to get dry. This cleanser cleans without stripping while at the same time very gently exfoliating the skin. I’ve found that after 2 months of use my skin is clearer and more luminous 
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Australia,mr,"This is hand down the best facial cleanser I've tried ( and I've tried countless numbers of cleanser from drug store to high end, and from every texture available out there, from gel to cream to balm and oil and etc) . This does not feel stripping but rather leaving your skin hydrating and the texture feel fun and divine. Especially for a winter months in Australia where my skin can be extremely dry and dehydrated. Highly recommend, even though it is on a little bit pricier side, I'd totally repurchase "
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Singapore,Fine,"For the price, I expected more from Allies of Skin. This cleanser does the job without leaving soon tight but that's about it. Nothing to really rave about."
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Malaysia,The cleanser is really good! ,"Hello ladies, please bare with me - I absolutely love this cleanser! It has helped with my acne spots and it's clearing. It works gently on the skin which is honestly refreshing. The price may be on a high side but use it WISELY and patiently :) It does work! "
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Malaysia,yay,"In my honest opinion, I absolutely love this cleanser. I’ve been using it for the past several months and I love the texture, performance and the mild scent. I’ve used this cleanser as a morning cleanser and I found it to be non-stripping and to be gentle. The cleanser is in a squeeze tube, which tends to be my favorite for disbursement.

The texture of the cleanser is almost like a gel. "
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Singapore,It’s a pass for me ,"Not recommended for oily skin. My face becomes more oily after using this as a daily facial cleanser. It’s suppose to balance your ph but apparently not. It also has a plastic scent which isn’t pleasant when you wanna wash your face and be all refreshed. For a high price, I would have expected better. I’m disappointed."
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Singapore,Ms,I love this facial cleanser! It’s hydrating and so smooth on the skin. Perfect cleanser for those with combination and oily skin. It’s pricey but totally worth it! 
ALLIES OF SKIN-Molecular Silk Amino Hydrating Cleanser,Singapore,Not worth the price ,"It works the same as any gentle cleanser, doesn’t do much for my skin. Would say it woks on any skin type but if you like to feel your skin getting squeaky clean after washing, this is not the product! But it is easy to use and smells okay. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Singapore,love it,it cleanses make-up off very well and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and supple. doesn’t leave that uncomfortable oily feeling you get with a lot of other oil cleansers after you rinse it off and has the fresh clean smell
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,Favourite,"My all time favourite oil cleanser! Before this one I would always hope around, trying a new oil cleanser each time, but with this one I'm onto my 4th bottle. It's such a lovely texture that spreads evenly, removes makeup perfectly and comes off with water. 
My only wish is that it came in a larger bottle!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,I don’t recommend it for eyes,"Good for face makeup but not for eyes. It cause redness and swollen .
 When I asked them, the recommended this for the waterproof mascara I should have stayed on the Sephora makeup remover."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,"So gently to the skin, after you rinse it, the skin feels soft and clean, very good product, I’m a new fan."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,One of the best,"One of the best makeup removal oil I have used. 
Remove make up fast, does not greasy, does not irritated skin and eyes. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Burns,I have sensitive eyes and this totally burns them. So bummed. Smells great though.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,best cleansing oil,it is the best cleansing oil i have used. even i didnt get breakout from this while i have too sensitive acne prone skin with oils but this works good. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,"great cleanser, removes make up, leave skin dewy",I absolutely love everything I have tried by biossance. This cleaner really gets your makeup off and leave your skin feeling fresh and supple. I’ve tried other oil cleansers and have never found one as good as this. I’ve repurchased so many times.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,Gentle,"This is a good every day cleansing oil. It takes most makeup off in one go but usually needs a second go on mascarato remove it fully, other than that it works great"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Let it go and always go back for this!,It took me forever to finish this bottle because about two pumps takes my entire face of makeup off. I have acne prone skin but I like to try new stuff. I use all kinds of caudalie products and I love but then I switched to their oil to remove makeup and got so many pimples. For some reason this oil is the only one I can use. Going back to the good stuff
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Obsessed,The only makeup removing oil I have tried so far that completely removes everything off my face before I cleanse. Does sting if you get it in your eye so be careful…..
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Great for Double Cleanse,"I love this cleansing oil, I follow it with the gentle cleanser in my double cleanse routine. My skin feels so clean afterwards but it still retains its oils/moisture. I will keep re-purchasing."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Canada,Eh,Removes makeup but it burns my eyes. Going to finish the bottle but wouldn’t repurchase again.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,Love this!,Great cleanser! Removes all makeup although sometimes not mascara. Also stings the eyes so be careful. Other than that its good for double cleansing. I use this first then go in with a second cleanser. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,Great scent and results,The cleansing oil smells amazing.  I use it in conjunction with the amino aloe cleanser to double cleanser in the evening. Removes any traces of makeup and leaves skin feeling clean and very moisturised.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,perfect makeup remover,"I am obsessed with Biossance. I have sensitive skin but I NEED my products to actually work.
This melts my makeup and leaves my skin feeling so smooth afterwards. I was worried using an oil that it may stick to the skin but it comes off so well.
It also has a nice soft smell that I was worried would hurt my skin but NOPE. I’ve now bought this 4 times and I don’t plan on changing"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Gently removes eye makeup and doesn’t sting,"I like this product so much i would buy it again. I think this is the perfect first step in a double cleaning routine, better than a lot of makeup remover balms and washes I have tried. Gets all my mascara off and gently cleanses if . I think it is great for my combo skin."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,i love this!! it didnt break my sensitive skin out and it takes off my makeup super easily. only downside is that it does take quite a bit of product to create a lather with the oil. other than that i LOVE
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Removes makeup well,"The oil feels silky and luxurious on the skin. Emulsifies nicely to a milky consistency when water is added. Great for removing makeup and waterproof mascara but personally, I would not repurchase because it stings my eyes slightly. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Pick a different product!,I was so disappointed in this cleanser. Can’t stand it. It’s too thin/ slips through your fingers. Barely lathers. I find it very ineffective. Smells nice is the only good thing.  Select something else.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,I found that this was difficult to get on my face since it would slip in between my fingers. I wish this was in a solid form!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Canada,fragrance stings my eyes.,Not great for removing eye make up. The fragrance stings my eyes. It didn’t happen right away but I now notice that I’m sensitive to it.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Singapore,stings eyes,"Ok, description did mention to avoid using around eyes. But why would a cleansing oil not include removing eye make up? My eyes really stings when some of it got into my eye. I wish they will consider modifying for formula to remove eye make up too, considering this is not cheap and would want a “all-in-1” remover. Overall, effective in removing make up cleanly, except for mascara. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,"it’s good, but…","This is an amazing cleansing oil in terms of taking off your makeup before going in with a cleanser. Out of all the cleansing oils I have tried, this one is incredible at removing even the most stubborn stains on your face! However, the reason I took off two stars is because of two major drawbacks. First of all, it’s highly fragrant…Not necessarily a bad smell, but there is no need for it to be that perfumed…Honestly worries me that it could potentially be irritating, even though it’s a wash off treatment. Secondly, this product has absolutely NO MERCY if you get it in your eyes. I have never had a product sting so badly, but not only that, the pain lasts for soooo long. It feels like as if you were to squeeze dish soap directly into your eyes. It’s not the end of the world, but it just means this is definitely more of a face cleansing oil and you’ll need another product to take off your eye makeup. It’s still a beautiful product and definitely gets the job done, but those two cons I listed are enough of me to probably not purchase this again. If you’re looking for an amazing cleansing oil, I suggest looking at Clinique’s - sounds cliche, but Clinique’s makeup removing line is the best I’ve ever used thus far."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,"Soft for the skin, not for the eyes!","I used this at night to double cleanse my skin. Doesn’t smell too heavy. Used about 3-4 pumps for the full face with light to medium makeup, leaves the skin soft. But if you wish to get it to take off your eye makeup, it’s probably not the one. It stings the eye even if you get near it. But it already stated on the box do not get into the eyes so that explains it. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,"I use this first when i double cleanse and it feels really nice on the skin, it is a bit more of a watery consistency so i have to pump a lot when because it’ll fall through my fingers."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,I use this as a first cleanse if I’ve put on makeup. Removes everything and feels like a spa treatment.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Philippines,Just ok,This product does what it says but I think there are better oil cleansers than this one. My biggest problem with this is that it stings my eyes. Won’t purchase again for that reason. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,gentle cleanser,I love this as a gentle cleanser for my face and neck. It leaves my skin hydrated and smooth. it's not for those who want that tight cleansed feeling. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,THE BEST,"The Best makeup remover I have ever tried. Seriously, the best. It takes off all of my makeup and does not leave anything behind. My eyes don’t look black after, my skin is fresh. I love it. I follow it up with a different cleanser after (double cleanse)."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,I returned this. Made my skin feel tight I think it has too many essential oils in it. Smells nice and took makeup off but had to use a lot and it was also watery. The Caudalie one works better and has less ingredients. Wanted to love.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,"I think this is a great product if you use heavy make up every day. It dissolves even waterproof make up which is great! But you still have to wash your face after, I like that my skin feels super soft and not greasy after I use it, but is one of those products that I liked but I’m not buying again, I’m using other eye make up remover and washing my face as I used to. Good product though."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,"I love this product so much! I stumbled across it looking for a double cleansing product that wasn’t in a jar, and now I am obsessed! I have went through three bottles now. I have oily skin, and it makes my skin so soft along with removing all my makeup and sunscreen."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Singapore,great product ,"Great product, removes light make up very well. Not too oily on my sensitive skin. The smell is great too, a little of orange citrus smell and its not too strong"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Amazing for double cleanse,"I love this product for the first step in a double cleanse. It gets off every last bit of stubborn makeup without harsh rubbing. And unlike other cleansing balms and oils I've tried in the past, it doesn't leave behind a film that I feel like I have to wash off before I can go in with my cleanser. I will continue to use it for as long as I can."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Amazing!,"This is the best cleansing oil I have found. It is light, but has lots of slip. Excellent at taking off eye and face makeup. Also very easy to rinse off of skin."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Canada,BEST PRODUCT EVER,"Love Love Love this product.  It is a make-up remover and skin cleanser all in one.  No matter how heavy your make-up is.  This is how to use it.  4-6 pumps on the palm of your hands, rub, and then apply to your face, massage your face, eyes, and lips everywhere.  Then wet your hands with water and massage your face again. Rinse and wipe.  That is it.  YOU WILL NEVER NEED ANYTHING ELSE AGAIN.  Stop using 1000 different products this does it all"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,"don’t purchase if you have oily, acne prone skin",I had really high hopes for this product but it unfortunately made me breakout like crazy when I had just cleared up and was starting to really take care of my skin. disappointed to say the least.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,wow,I’ve only used cleansing balms for removing makeup but this has beaten it. My skin doesn’t feel oily or slippery after cleansing . Makes my skin feel soft after just using it 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,stings eyes,"This oil is alright, it cleans the face. But it does sting the eyes. Not sure if it’s worth the price."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Canada,Nourishing & Decongesting,"In just a few days this product works like a charm, leaving my skin feeling softer than ever while also noticeably cleansing impurities right off. Massaging this formula into my skin revitalizes areas of dullness and does not feel stripping in any way. The addition of Squalane keeps moisture locked in throughout the day and my typically oily skin looks healthier than ever."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,Wanted to like this product but didn’t!,"Too overly fragranced and hurts your eyes if you accidentally get it in them. I found it took several tries for it to get the makeup off at the end of the day and I was pretty unimpressed with the product overall despite liking so many others from this range. Gave this one away to a friend because after a couple of weeks, it ended up breaking me out. Would not buy again!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Canada,Wow !,"Love it! Didn't sting my eyes, smells amazing. My skin has never felt more hydrated. gorgeous skin !"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,not good sadly,I really wanted to love this as I love other products in this biossance line however immediately upon trying it it smelled so strongly of citrus orange it really turned me off.  led way to burning in my eyes and my skin felt quite irritated after using this. I normally use tacha cleansing oil that is thicker this oil seemed watery/didn’t clean very well either just felt irritated afterwards
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Singapore,obsessed ,"this is so effective and smells really nice! i love how gentle it is too:) one thing i will say is that it’s not eye safe, so if you wear mascara this might not be the one for you"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,just heavy oil!!,just no!!!  i love this  brand & use their squalene oil for couple of years now but this one  is just a lot of heavy oil not a cleansing oil. it leaves my skin with thick layer of  oil after rinsing that i have to wash 2–3 times with a face wash to remove the oil & that process left  my skin dry & feeling thin like paper. dont bother!!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Second bottle ,This is my second bottle. Use it as my first cleanse. I love that there’s no fragrant to it. No irritation or bumps on my skin. Will definitely repurchase again. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,Oil Cleanser,I prefer a cleansing oil over a balm. This one is very light consistency and has a citrus scent. None of that bothers me however I do find that if I get any in my eyes they do sting.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Caused Tiny Bumps,"Worked well at first like it didn’t sting my eyes as I expected, but then tiny bumps started showing up all over my face. 
Not good for those prone to fungal acne or sensitive to essential oils."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,Miss,A pretty good oil cleanser but will burn your eyes
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,does the job,This oil cleanser is my preferred first cleanser for the shower. Melting balms are nice but for the shower an oil cleanser in a pump bottle is so much more convenient 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,5 stars,I like it and it is much better than makeup wipes.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Great but needs isotonicity adjustment/stings eyes,"Love the feel and finish on my skin. Cleanses well, especially eye makeup. Only advice is to adjust the isotonicity/pH so that it doesn't sting eyes."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Nah,Had high hopes with this one as I like the brand and they have good ingredients. Didnt take my make up off well and really itches in the eyes. Dont use this for eye make up. Felt that after washing I needed to redo it and follow up with another cleanser. Like that it doesnt smell and feels good on tje skin. Thats about it.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,"For the most part I love this oil cleanser. However, for the price I wish it emulsified more like the klairs cleanser I used before this. I also wish it went easier on the fragrance (although the scent is SO nice) because it is a bit irritating to use around my eyes"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Singapore,still prefer Bobbi brown cleansing oil ,"Medium weight cleansing oil as first cleanse. It stings my eyes a little bit, just don’t let it get inside the eyes. Still prefer the Bobbi brown cleansing oil but the price is too expensive."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Perfect starter for evening routine!,"This cleansing oil is the perfect first step for at the end of your day. 100% I prefer over Dermalogica Precleanse. It works great for me removing face, eye, and lip makeup. If I have a little extra stubborn eye makeup I just use a bit extra on a makeup removing cloth or pad and voila! this is also great when my face needs a break from my full routine. I use 2-3 pumps of the cleanser only - no water - first then I wet my hands and start to rinse. Dermalogica left me feeling still too oily, whereas I feel I have a better balance after this product."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Canada,Another Great Biossance Product,Biossance does it again! I love this cleansing oil as a first in a two part cleanse to remove sunblock and makeup at night before going in with my YTTP cleanser. I’ve noticed a reduction in breakouts and my dry skin LOVES this product.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,"Does the job, but nothing special","This product does the job.  It removes my eye and face makeup without to much rubbing.  However, it does sting your eyes so make sure to keep them closed when using.  I didn't find it hydrating, which is surprising because it has squalane in it.  However, it didn't leave me dry.  One bottle lasted about 3 months.  I prefer the Amore  Pacific Cleansing oil over this.  Its much more hydrating, but it does have fragrance."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Not a good product,"This product does not remove eye make up well enough. It is actually VERY irritating around the eye area. If you’re looking for an eye makeup remover, this is not it! Too much money and the quality is just poor. You’re better off buying something else. Don’t waste your money on this."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Stings my eyes. It cleans well but other oil cleansers aren’t as hard on my eyes
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,Adore!,"I love this cleansing oil so much, it effectively cleans the makeup and sunscreen off my face so it’s ready for a double cleanse. It’s wonderful for my sensitive, acne prone, red skin. It’s become a staple in my routine, I will be repurchasing this again and again!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Can't use on your eyes,"I was disappointed to find out this is not meant to be used in the eye area.  It works fine for the face, but hard to use a makeup remover that you can't use on your eyes"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Eye Irritant,"I love a good double cleanse and have many cleansing oils I enjoy, but this unfortunately is not one of them. The oil is indeed very lightweight and does a good job at breaking down makeup and sunscreen, but it really burns the eyes. If you're looking for a cleansing oil to use everywhere besides the eye area, go for it, but for me I use cleansing oils and balms to break down eye makeup and there are many oils out there that do not cause the stinging and vision film that this one does."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,OK ,"Smells similar to THREE cleansing oil, but with a lighter texture, kind of like Shu Uemura Porefinist cleansing oil (the pink one). 

Cleansing power is so-so I guess? with makeup on, will definitely have to double cleanse. BUT it is super super gentle, and doesn't dry out the skin!!!! Amazing. I think it would be great for daily use. 

Unfortunately, it did sting my eyes a little bit. Only a little bit. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Canada,Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,"I tried this because all stores were sold out of the Boscia Makeup Breakup Cool Cleansing Oil. I think it’s a good alternative, but I still prefer the Boscia. I don’t think the scent is overwhelming at all (and I’m sensitive to fragrance), but it is thin and it doesn’t last as long as the Makeup Breakup. Overall it works well for taking off makeup and for a deep but non-stripping cleanse."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,"The greatest cleanser, period.","I use this for double cleansing and twice a month oil cleanse; it leaves my skin smooth and supple, melts away any makeup (even waterproof). I love the texture, I love the smell, I’ll buy it over and over until I expire."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,A MUST HAVE,this and the tatcha oil are my favorite cleansers to remove makeup. i have not found ANYTHING else that removes makeup like this. i can use this over my eyes and my full coverage makeup and it melts it ALL. i LOVE this oil. it does have a strong fragrance but i love it and it doesn’t bother me at all. will definitely be repurchasing. always.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Stings my Eyes; Very Fragrant,"Very fragrant, lightweight, removes makeup but keep it away from the eyes. My eyes are sensitive and can’t tolerate this oil. Between this and the fragrance, it doesn’t seem like it would be good for sensitive skin types."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Canada,Not for me,Not good for me. I think i am just not a fan of oils and I wasn't a fan of the smell and the texture. Would not recommend for dry skin.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Canada,Okay,"good cleansing oil most skin, not a great option for sensative skin, leaky packaging"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Not my favourite cleansing oil but it does its job!,Easy on the pocket price-wise and it does its job! Not one of my favourite cleansing oils as I prefer using a cleansing balm. But this bottle would last you a long time even when you use it on a daily basis as a little bit goes a long way.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,This is my favorite of the several cleansing products offered.  It is moisturizing as well as cleansing.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Make up remover !,"It does what it says! Make up and impurities removed . 
I put it on right before I shower. Barley anything on my cotton when I use my toner ."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Canada,I love this product!,"I love this product. Easy to use, melting, absorb. After wash your face, you can still stay moisturizer on your face.  No oily."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Miss,"I think it works well as a oil cleanser, i've noticed a few times where the oil plugs in my pores successfully (& satisfyingly haha) came out!! But it requires patience to massage it on your skin for awhile - may not work 100% ALL the time. Regardless, its also great for removing make up etc. May leave a residue feeling even after washing so i follow up with another gentle non-oil cleanser. Worth buying during sales "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,"This cleansing oil works well to take off makeup but it bothers my eyes during cleansing and after I wash it off. I also find that despite having squalane in it, my skin feels stripped. This might be due to the strong scent it has? I’m not sure. My skin is very dry and sensitive, especially in the winter, so feeling like my face is even dryer and tighter after I wash it is not something I like."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Decent,"Pretty watery, not as thick of an oil as Clinique take the day off or Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil. It also made my eyes burn a bit which the other cleansing oils or balms never did. Even the Elf balm didn’t burn my eyes. Honestly wouldn’t buy again but it’s a decent oil. My face felt the same as it does with other oils after washing off."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Good but ..,It works and takes off my make up and a first clense.... but I prefer a balm.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Canada,INCREDIBLE,This is the best oil cleanser I have ever used. I have literally put my entire family onto it. It gets my makeup off so easily and my skin feels amazing after. I would completely recommend!! Overall an amazing company too!!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Five stars because the product does exactly what it says and exactly what it shouldn’t. It’s baffling how on many on these reviews the concern of eye make removal is flowing. Read before buying then make an educated purchase. It is NOT for eye make up removal period. Other then that…best cleaner I’ve invested in.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,works but hurts my eyes,Works really well to remove waterproof mascara and makeup but for some reason makes my eyes burn! Just not worth it. So my fav for removing makeup is either using a makeup eraser and the Lancôme bi-facial remover or Farmacy cleansing balm.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,amazing for waterproof mascara,"Great product! I like wearing waterproof mascara because it lasts all day. I started wearing the Lancôme mascara and while I love it, it’s really hard to remove at the end of the day. I went ahead and tried this cleanser hoping it would be good to remove waterproof make up. It is amazing!!! So happy I took the chance! It works so well and is gentle on my eyes."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Awesome product!,"Does a great job getting all makeup and grime off. Minorly stings my eyes, but not a dealbreaker."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Canada,"Does the job, just not the best.","I bought this hoping it would work as well as my farmacy green clean cleansing balm while also being more convenient as it has a pump. Although it appeals to my lazy needs, it’s not the most effective at removing makeup. It takes a bit more effort to remove makeup and can sting the eyes a bit when trying to remove mascara. It works but it’s not the best which is something to consider when paying a high price point."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,it works for me and i have oily red skin. i have tried other oil cleansers but i keep coming back to this
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,a few deal breakers- returning.,"The smell Is nice and It leaves skin soft- it’s great unless you: 
1. Have to remove waterproof makeup and 
2. Have sensitive eyes. This burns my eyes snd makes the whole experience bad. 

I think the price is fair, it would last a while and would be great for light to no makeup days where eyes could be avoided."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,I absolutely love this stuff.  I use it with a Makeup Eraser to get off the first layer and then use a mild cleanser afterwards if I've been wearing foundation.  If not this is a great mild cleanser that leaves my skin feeling soft.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Love this!,"I used to use the Dermalogica pre-cleanse but when that wasn’t available at the store I picked this up and it’s now my go-to. Terrific product (Bioessance is a great brand in general, I’ve found) and priced much better than the Dermalogica cleansing oil. Never had any skin issues from this and will keep re-purchasing. I double-cleanse and this is my first step."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,"So Far, So Good!","Disclaimer: I rarely wear makeup, so I haven't had much experience using this to take off makeup. Mainly used to take off sunscreen at end of day.

This has been really great for removing sunscreen + other dirt and oils from my face at the end of the day! It goes on really nicely, and I can feel it removing the sunscreen off of my face when I rinse it off. It's also really moisturizing and hydrating, which is great for my dry skin. It makes my skin feel plump and soft. I also really appreciate the eco-friendly approach from this brand, so that'll always be a plus in my book. I've used it once to remove makeup and it did the trick, but it did sting my eyes a bit. However, I haven't used it enough to remove makeup to know if this is a regular occurrence with this product. Overall, I really love it and would happily purchase it again."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Good but a few issues,"I’ve been using this cleansing oil for several months as the first step in my morning and evening double cleanse, and for the most part, I’m enjoying it. These are my honest observations based on my experience. 

Pros
- Removes all of my makeup, even my water proof mascara, although I do have to take some extra time massaging it over my eyes. 
- I was hesitant to use an oil on my already oily skin, but because oil attracts oil, this cleanser actually helps balance my skin by removing excess sebum and impurities
- Makes my skin super soft
- The bottle has a ton of product! I only need one pump if I don’t have makeup on and 1.5 pumps if I am wearing makeup, so a single bottles lasts me a long time. 

Cons
- As mentioned before, it takes a little extra work to remove waterproof mascara, but I have yet to find a cleansing oil or balm that does this with just a few swipes. 
- If any gets in my eyes, it can sting. I have to make sure my eyes are tightly shut and I rinse it off well 
- Difficult to travel with. Not only is it a big bottle, but oil can leak during travel. I put it in a large ziplock baggie before putting it in my toiletries bag. 
- I definitely have to use a regular cleaner after to make sure I get all of the product off my face. I don’t mind this, but if you’re looking for a 2 in 1 makeup remover and cleanser, this may not be right for you. 

All in all, this cleaner is great for me personally, but it may not be right for everyone."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,LOVE,The best cleanser I've used to remove my makeup!!!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Biossance Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,I’ve been trying for months to figure out how to make this product work but no matter the amount of this oil I’m using or how long I massage it I’m still needing to double wash my face with cleanser to remove the makeup or even just tinted moisturizer. It’s not an effective pre-cleanse.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,The Finish Is Unmatched,Does anyone have fear of oil cleanser residue - just me? Well this is not that. The Biossance Cleansing Oil feels like skincare opulence at the end of the day and cuts through make up and SPF with just two pumps. The finish is super soft and hydrating and let’s my cleanser get straight to work. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,It's okay,"Lightweight oil cleanser. Feels nice and didn't make me break out. Fairly effective for removing makeup, but the reason I won't be repurchasing is because it stings my eyes when removing eye makeup. It also is scented which I don't hate but feels unnecessary and probably contributes to the eye stinging. Next time I will go back to DHC cleansing oil because it is unscented and doesn't irritate my eyes"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Runny and Doesn’t Remove Mascara,"Having a terrible time getting through this product… I don’t even wear waterproof mascara and this doesn’t even make it budge! It is also veryyy runny so you have to be quick when pumping and then putting it on your face otherwise you will lose a lot of product. 
It also stings when I get it in my eyes even when they’re tightly closed."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,make up remover ,"I bought this after reading a review that it clears up blackheads on the nose and was excited. I can say it does not do that...but it is really nice and I'm now on my second bottle. it's so easy to remove make-up including mascara and makes my skin feel clean, soft and smooth. it doesn't hurt my eyes at all."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,Australia,Stings my eyes,"Works as a first cleanse, but it stings my eyes which is a deal breaker for me."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,My favorite face cleanser,"I love this cleanser and my skin does too. I have very, very dry, rashly skin from multiple autoimmune diseases, so my skin is also very sensitive. I’ve struggled to find a face cleanser that my skin didn’t rebel against. This is the best one I’ve ever used. It’s gentle and moisturizing, yet it also thoroughly cleans my skin. It doesn’t strip my skin of its moisture like most other products. I use baby washcloths to gently exfoliate my skin when washing the oil off, then I follow it up with Biossance’s squalane oil. That’s enough to keep my face soft and rash free. 

I also use this to clean my upper arms. I have a very stubborn rash there that prescription lotions didn’t clear up completely (on my cheeks near my jaw bone as well). Once I started using this cleansing oil followed up by the squalane oil, then my prescription lotion, it cleared up. I can’t recommend this oil highly enough."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Antioxidant Cleansing Oil,USA,Tried and True product!,Takes off waterproof mascara in one try! I love cleansing balms but as a busy mom most of the time I do t have time to open the tub of cleanser scoop it out etc.. so I bought this leave it in the shower and just pump out as much as I need in the shower and it’s done! All my makeup comes off no problem. I have tried to find a cheaper replacement but no luck so far so I’ll just keep repurchasing.
DIOR-Diorsnow Essence Of Light Purifying Brightening Foam,Singapore,Good,This face wash cleans well. Great texture. washes make up off well. it does help to lighten a bit. Will try out the other product from the same line. Worth the buy 
DIOR-Diorsnow Essence Of Light Purifying Brightening Foam,Singapore,Repurchase,"Another product that’s constantly repurchased and stocked up during sales for my mom. For reference, her skin is combination/oily. She bought it for its brightening properties and really enjoys using it!"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Foaming Facial Soap,Singapore,Does it’s job,"I have pretty normal to oily skin. I use this once a day or twice when I’m active. It generally cleanses well—foams up beautifully. However, it does leave my skin dry and flaky if I don’t use an intensive serum or cream for nighttime. "
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Foaming Facial Soap,Malaysia,Acne savior,I've used so many products for so many years to combat my acne problems. none till this date has worked expt for this. ever since I started using this product my face has significantly improved. 
LAURA MERCIER-Balancing Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,squeaky clean,"Pleasantly surprised that its lesser known skincare range does well too.. Works for me as I have combination skin, and like my skin to feel squeaky clean and supple.."
LIXIRSKIN-Electrogel Cleanser,Australia,"Fine, but not revolutionary","I was attracted to the entire Lixir line based upon their claims of revolutionising skincare, and whilst the products are fine (they maintain the condition of my skin), they are far from the miracle advertised. 
This particular cleanser isn’t great for makeup removal (I paired it with a micellar water, or balm cleanse), which is a strike through one of its claims, although it is comfortable to apply, non-irritating to my sensitive skin.
There are better cleansers out there, but this one is fit for purpose, unless you’re searching for something to thoroughly remove your makeup."
LIXIRSKIN-Electrogel Cleanser,Australia,Lixir Cleanser,I love the smell of this product and it feels really nice on my skin. Gentle yet effective. Great price point. I will definitely purchase this cleanser again. 
LIXIRSKIN-Electrogel Cleanser,Singapore,Ms,"Was on a search for a cleanser and saw that this had tons of positive reviews, and a huge celebrity cult following so i decided to give it a try. I was excited to give it a go cause of the electro gel portion of it but i after 3 uses i had to stop. It made my skin bumpy and more red. Perhaps if your skin is sensitive or if you usually have redness, give this a miss. "
LIXIRSKIN-Electrogel Cleanser,,My favourite cleanser ,"I have been using Lixir products for two years now and love the simplicity of this product line. Each product does exactly what it’s supposed to do. 
I use the cleanser in the evening and the Vitamin C in the morning. 
I massage a pea-size of the cleanser into my face and neck and before washing it off with a soft cloth and water, I brush my teeth. Then I rinse it off. 
"
LIXIRSKIN-Electrogel Cleanser,,Miss,"Love this Cleanser, very soft and gentle as well as effective at removing makeup and impurities. Smells great and works well with the rest of the Lixir Range as well as on its own. Non Irritating.
"
LIXIRSKIN-Electrogel Cleanser,,"Disappointing, but does smell great","I did a lot of research in order to get the perfect facial cleanser. Upon using the cleanser, I must admit it smells amazing and the packaging is very cute. However, it doesn’t wash off my makeup all that well, even after double washing. I won’t be buying it again."
LIXIRSKIN-Electrogel Cleanser,,Really interesting product to use,"I bought this to use as a cleanser, but soon found it better as a mask once a week on my skin. It cleanses extremely well almost drying the skin, which is odd for a creamy cleanser - you need to apply a good moisturiser afterwards. I really like this product, would recommend testing on your skin first as has a tingly feel when applied for a little while. "
LIXIRSKIN-Electrogel Cleanser,,Non-drying,"Firstly, I'm probably not the biggest fan of the texture. It's a light, non-foaming cream cleanser. Besides the texture of the cream it seems to do a pretty good job removing traces of makeup. My face didn't feel dry afterwards either. "
LIXIRSKIN-Electrogel Cleanser,,My New Fave!!!,Loooooove this cleanser! I love that I can use it to wash off my eye makeup but also leave it on as a mask. It has a beautiful fresh smell to it. It really cleans my skin without leaving it dry. I have normal skin that doesn’t get too oily but I do occasionally get break outs. This has made my complexion so much brighter and fresher. I don’t think I’ll be using anything else! 
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Skip this one,I have been using La Mer products for years & this is the worst that I have run across. Don't waste your money on this product. It leaves a textured residue I had to rinse it off immediately. Disappointing
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,Malaysia,love it!,"I do used La Mer products’s range. And i love it. The smells so good. I used it at day and night as make up remover. Especially when i just make natural make up. It will make my skin much better. Feelin fresh.It doesn’t make my skin any big changes which is good. Even though it a bit pricey, but it good for me. So maybe i will keep repurchased it. Thank you La Mer for good products ."
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,Singapore,muss,"Other than the pricey tag, it is the best out there. Have used about 10 of them. Confirm worth it. Wish the price not that luxury. Simplest n most trustworthy regime to help me with my skin routine. End of every day."
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Luxurious and Effective,This stuff feels so refreshing and my skin is left feeling very clean. It feels luxurious and I definitely feel better after cleansing my face with this. I feel like it’s definitely worth the splurge. It smells divine as well. Very good product! It melts away makeup and leaves skin clean and refreshed.
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Micellar Water - 100ml,It removed my makeup but it’s way too expensive. Also kinda stings my eye
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,one of my la Mer faves,I love how gentle this micellar water is and how soothed it leaves my face. This is one of 5 or 6 la Mer products essential to my skincare routine. The price point is high however and I wanted to get my sister into micellar water as part of her Xmas gift but I know she would never spend the money on this again so I have been looking for a cheaper alternative. The fragrance is also really strong which I don’t mind but I know most people prefer fragrance free. I use this first thing in the morning to refresh my face before doing a few morning chores then do a full routine with Renee Rouleau mint face wash as a primary am cleanser. I looks forward to my skincare every morning it’s the most refreshing part of my day!!
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,"Works well, but heavily fragranced","My mother got two 6.7 oz bottles of this stuff as GWP for a fairly enormous La Mer haul and passed them on to me as she does not use micellar water. I use this in the mornings in lieu of cleansing probably half of the days as over cleansing really dries out my skin. This works quite well, doesn't dry me out and is very gentle - does not sting at all. Overall, I think it's a very effective product. It is, however, like all other La Mer products very fragranced. While I do not have any fragrance sensitivities,  I've found that I do particularly enjoy the experience of using things that are very heavily scented, so especially for the price of his micellar water, I will not be purchasing after I use up my stash."
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Micellar Water - 100ml,"Meh. The small size is priced at $55, and the amount of product is too small to reliably remove makeup everyday. I ran too quickly to justify the price and the inconvenience of having to re-purchase all the time. I think it would be best used along with a makeup removing balm. It does not sting though, and even when my skin felt burned/dehydrated during the retinoid purging process, it was super gentle and hydrating."
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Micellar Water - 100ml,This is a capable micellar water. There’s nothing special with it to be honest but it does clean well and without residue. I knocked one star because of the scent.
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Complete waste of money,"I typically use Koh Gen Do Cleansing Spa Water Cloths (and sometimes the regular liquid version), but am always interested in giving other brands and products a try. One thing I look for in a product marketed as micellar water is whether or not my face feels clean/naked (ie doesn’t feel like I’m wearing any products) after use. The La Mer micellar water is specifically said to leave the face feeling clean and that you won’t need any follow-up rinse with plain water after using it. LIES. Of all the micellar waters I’ve tried, this one leaves my face with the worst residual texture/feeling—there’s no way I can’t rinse with plain water after I use this, really. I’ve used it both to remove makeup and also just as a general refresher if I’m not already wearing any makeup or other products; I usually apply it with a cotton pad, but have also tried putting some in the palms of my hands and applying it directly. Regardless of application method, after using it my face feels sort of sticky, definitely not clean or refreshed. It does work well at removing makeup, so I’m just going to have to treat it as a makeup remover instead of a micellar water. I tried a sample of the Drunk Elephant micellar product recently, and it’s overall a much more effective and affordable option, IMO."
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Delightfully shocked!,"I have to admit, I’ve kind of thrown myself down the La Met rabbit hole, and this was my latest addition. To say that I was blown away by the way this took my makeup away is an understatement. It is so smooth and gentle and left my skin feeling unbelievably fresh. I’m hooked!!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,My Favorite Toner,"I use this as my after cleanse toner daily and nightly 
I also use it to refresh my skin, if needed or to prep for makeup but I always follow with the treatment lotion and moisturizer (and primer if applying makeup)
It softens any dryness or taut skin
My whole family loves it and we all have different skin types"
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,Canada,best product ever !,"If I only had to chose 1 product from my whole skin care routine , this would be the one !  My favourite part of the day ! It cleans so well it’s smells Devine it’s not expensive compare to the rest of the la Mer line . I love it !"
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,stings my eyes,it burns and stings my eyes. is it eucalyptus probaly? But its too hars to remove make  up around the eyes. Very strong scent too
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Not the best,"This product has a very strong scent. It smells nice but it is overwhelming. I also find it a bit harsh on the skin. I have used Chanel démaquillant yeux intense for years and for some reason decided to switch it up this time. I bought this to use as an eye make up remover after using Chanel la mousse as a face wash. I regret my decision, especially for the price point."
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Best,"Works much better than other brands I’ve purchased. Really lifts up oil, makeup and even removes waterproof eye liner."
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Clean and Refreshing,The best Micellar water I have ever tried. As all La Mer products you pay for the quality and the quality is top notch. My makeup comes off easy with my cotton pads. It is hydrating to the skin and has a divine scent. The benefits of the miracle broth stays on your skin!
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,YES INVEST IN IT,"I almost forgot this was micellar water and thought it was a treatment lotion... and then I continued to seamlessly remove my makeup without a tug. Yes it’s expensive and I absolutely splurged but I would do it again!!!!! I have a background in skincare and beauty so I felt the need to resist the hype and the prices at la mer counter for YEARS...  again, thinking it was a bunch of hype. I can only speak for what I’ve tried, this micellar water and the pump foundation so far- and so far so great. Will it change your life? Maybe. Will you know that you’re missing something in your beauty routine if you’re already using an a-ok  micellar water like garnier? Probably not."
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,Canada,Just perfect!,"Omg! I bought this as a blind purchase as I love whatever La Mer products I have (gel exfoliant and gel cleanser) and this product is amazing! I only wash my face once a day and I use this in the morning to 'cleanse' before I use an essence and moisturizer. Let me tell you how my skin feels! So soft, smooth and clean! I use a bit onto a cotton make up pad and it cleans the night cream off and my skin looks amazing! First time using a micellar water and definitely will keep this one going!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Micellar Water - 100ml,"Its not a bad cleanser, but definitely not worth the price. I like their soft lotion very much, but didnt like their cleanser and toner. Average product."
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Micellar Water - 100ml,Best product ever! It goes so well with La Mer Liquid foundation
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Thank you La Mer Micellar Water!,"yes, there is a hefty price tag attached to this product, but i would still 100% recommend it to anyone who had a similar issue to me. About 5 months ago, i noticed i was having small bumps, similar to acne but not quite as red or noticeable, appear on my forehead. the hard water at my college was an issue so i decided to buy this and use it to cleanse my face after i showered. THIS WORKED MIRACLES. happy to report my face only breaks out few and far between now and the bumps on my forehead have vanished. thank you to the la mer micellar water!!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Perfection in a bottle.,I received this today and used it for the first  time. I am impressed at how simply beautiful the bottle is. I poured some on a pad and went it glided like silk over my skin and while removing every drop of makeup without stripping my skin. And it smells fantastic. I already look forward to removing my makeup tomorrow night.
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Beautiful Micellar Water,"This micellar water makes me hate early morning wake up calls a little bit less! Beautiful soft La Mer fragrance we all have come to know & love, gentle yet effective texture to remove any residue on my skin that accumulated overnight. I haven’t tried this to remove my makeup, but I’m certain as other reviews said it must work well for that. Personally I prefer to just use a micellar water first thing in the morning for a quick, gentle cleanse before my skincare and makeup goes on. Lasts a long time too. Will repurchase !!!!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,My New Favorite,"I love the cleansing micellar water!  It’s not oily like some make up removers and it freshens your skin very nicely.  It is moisturizing and light on the skin.  Please note, I do not wear much make up, so it does remove my concealer, lipstick, and eye makeup."
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Beauty in a Bottle,"I use this as my morning cleanse and look forward to it every single day. It is so comforting, and my skin looks lovely!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Micellar Water - 100ml,I didn’t want to love it but I do. It replaced my eye makeup remover. I now use less of oil/water cleanser. The smell is divine. It smells like luxurious skincare.
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Good stuff! I can see my skin getting better,"I like this product. I wear quite light makeup. My makeup routine is always like this primer, cushion foundation, blush, a little bit of conturing powder for my nose, eyebrow powder. I wear lash extensions so I don’t really wear eye makeup. This micellar water takes all my makeup off by using 2 cotton pads. There is no need to really soak the pads for me but gotta get them wet enough. I try to take off eye makeup sometime but it takes more to remove all the colors and waterproof eyeliner. Also, I can see my skin is improving. At first, I was afraid that only using this without washing my face with face wash would break me out. Oh boy! I was wrong. This little friend is amazing for those who would get lazy at night after a long day like me. It can take off everything without rinsing. After I use this, I apply toner with cotton pad and there is no residue on the pad. It’s really cool. It’s on a pricier side for a makeup remover without rinsing so I just take one star off."
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Love Her!,"Adore this product. It smells so divine, and cleanses so deep while making your skin feel like it’s just being bathed in fancy. And come on - it’s La Mer. That’s some quality for your skin right now. Can’t imagine living without this in my bathroom forever!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,I only hate that it’s so expensive,By far the best Micellar Water I’ve tried. Leaves my skin clean soft and glowing. No residue or unpleasant stickiness or smell. It is absolutely amazing!
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Pricey but worth it!,This is the perfect take your makeup off water cleanser. At first I was skeptical about it I have previously used the Gariner micellar water cleanser and it didn’t do much for me and felt like I still had to rinse again just to get the remainder of my makeup off. But I went ahead and took a chance with La Mer and so glad I did I purchased the smaller size first which is $50 and I am loving it a little goes a long way and I no longer need to over rinse my face just to take off my makeup this doesn’t it all for me. The small bottle lasted me about 4 months and will definitely be repurchasing to the larger size. Pricey but worth it.
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Micellar Water - 100ml,"Best micellar water available, takes all makeup, dirt and pollutants out of your skin and leaves it so clean, the big bottle is worth it you can’t go wrong with this"
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Love ❤️ it !!,Does a great job on removal of all makeup. Also love the fragrance.
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,It's Alright,I'm really surprised that this has such glowing reviews. I ordered it based on the reviews
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,It's Ninety Dollar Micellar Water.,"There are a few of the La Mer products that I consider indispensable, but this is not one of them.  For $90 I was expecting something really special.  It's micellar water.  It's very hydrating.  It removes all my makeup.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do.  But there is no way to justify this price, even for a frivolous shopper like me.  There are SO many great micellar options out there for a fraction of the price."
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Amazing brand,"I received this product as a present for my birthday and I am absolutely in love with this product, I use this to remove my make up and my skin feels clean and calm after using this. I know this product is really pricey but because of this, I bought the La Mer soft cream and let me tell you this product is life changing, make sure you apply it on your finger tips and then warm it up on your hands and then lightly press onto your face. Your skin feels perfect not too dry and not too oily, your skin feels super clean and calm and my skin has never looked better! As for the cleansing micellar water, from the looks of my bottle im guessing it will last me for 6 weeks because i use it once daily."
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Micellar Water - 100ml,"I use this at night to remove all my makeup before washing with the La Mer cleansing Foam. This water removes all my makeup, even eyeliner and mascara. I have starting using this instead of makeup wipes. I find that it is a little oily so I do not use in the morning. I can see myself using this on long flights to refresh my face As well. Love this."
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,YOU NEED THIS,This is extremely moisturizing. You feel the difference once applied. I use this in the morning to wash off my overnight cream and it gives you that dewy but not oily moisture for the day. Great under makeup!
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Worth it.,Love it. Removes makeup and dirt that is not seen by your eyes. I am amazed everytime whenever I look at my skin.
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Micellar Water - 100ml,"I like this micellar water, I find it washes away all the makeup effortlessly. But it leaves my skin feeling tacky, and it smells like sunlight dish soap to me; but I have to wash my face again with water or another cleanser afterwards (which defeats the purpose) For the price point, I will continue to use the bottle I have, but will not repurchase."
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Leave it all behind,"One of my favorite La Mer items. I love to use this after cleansing. I feel like it balances my skin. I Anjou he soft, gentle scent. Very pleasant."
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,love at first touch,I wanted to not like this product Bc of its price tag...... but the very first time I used it... I knew there was something very special about it. I have been using this now to remove my makeup for the whole week and I love it like no other :)
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,Even good for guys,"This micellar water is perfect for removing excess build up from sweat, sun screen, and a long day at the beach without inflaming  sun burnt skin.  Infact it helps to soothe and cool down even the most irritated skin. Perfect for use after shaving!  Hands down a great way to clean your face!  Expensive but worth it!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,HG,omg! totally in love with this product! My skin just soaks it up and it's great for cleaning my neck after the barn. It leaves my skin feeling amazing and after 4 weeks I'm seeing drastic improvements in fine wrinkles and elasticity. seems to be a nice amount of miracle broth. it is expensive but so worth it! Try it you won't be disappointed so glad I did.
LA MER-The Cleansing Micellar Water,USA,replaced makeup wipes,I enjoy this stuff because you don't need to rinse  after using. I use this after my toner. Doesn't leave skin dry or have a bad smell. It's an oil. Love!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,"I found this to be the tiniest bit drying, but it gently cleared my skin up during a break out. I was a little skeptical of paying so much for such a small bar, but the smallest bit goes a long way and this ended up being more cost-effective than the usual gel cleanser that I would buy. Added bonus: it’s easier to travel with than a giant bottle!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,didn't work for me,"dried out my skin in 2 weeks.
also the ingredient list provided on the website is not complete."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Transformational! I pray they never discontinue,"Ive been struggling with skin irritation for the past year: red scaly patches, flaking itchy eyelids, acne, dryness, eczema, and uneven texture. I've tried so many fancy serums and moisturizers with cleansers from Cetaphil, Cerave, and The Ordinary... Nothing was calming my angry skin! Finally, I wanted to try something completely different, and gave a bar cleanser a try. Overnight (literally) I saw a difference, and it only got better over the next few weeks. The never-ending cycle of flaking eyelids and red eczema spots I could not soothe for a year was healed within a week. The rough uneven surface smoothed over a few weeks. I still get the odd spots here and there, but it definitely did not cause any breakouts. Sure, it's less tidy on your counter and while travelling, but I'll take that over any of the skin issues I was having. And I love the silky slippery way it lathers and moves across the face. My only fear is it being discontinued down the line seeing as it's not as popular as their items, and people get hung up on the bar format. 

If I could only use 1 Drunk Elephant product, this would be it!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,New favorite!,My new favorite cleanser. I will never go back to liquid cleansing soap ever again. This little bar makes such a strong lather with the LITTLEST amount. in love with this!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Worth Every Penny,"The title speaks for itself. This is by far, the BEST facial cleansing bar ever!  Not to mention it’s the best product at removing makeup. Way better than foaming cleansers or other types of cleansers that commit to removing all makeup. This one does it - and it also shows up everything else that you once thought did a pretty decent job. Lasts approximately 3 months when used by two gals (mother and daughter) at the end of the day, every day. Fab find. On 2nd bar now and will order more over time. Not switching. Ever."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Good at cleaning,This soap does an excellent job at cleansing your face without your face feeling stripped.  I definitely recommend it!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Singapore,squeaky clean,"I gave this a try although I'm already using a drunk elephant jelly cleanser. it turns out this cleans better than the jelly cleanser and has no drying effect at all, only cons is it's pricey and I won't repurchase."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,Purchased once before and now purchasing it again. I have less breakouts and my skin is more hydrated. I like to use it with an electric brush to get my blackheads a little better but it also works well without.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Pekee is the BEST,"I have been using this Cleansing bar for the past year, and have been breaking out less and less, to none every month. It lathers beautifully, and I like to lather so used every night for cleansing with or without make-up it lasts for about 3 months or so. It washed fresh but not drying. It is the BEST cleansing bar I have ever used in my life. Seriously."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,The Best,My favorite cleanser ever. It removes every speck of makeup and leaves my skin feeling completely clean. I love the simplicity of using a bar cleanser and it lasts for so long.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,almost perfect!,"This cleanser does exactly what it says it does abs lathers beautifully. It does not dry out my combo sensitive skin while still making sure it gets clean. Works really well on its own or as a second cleanse after a cleansing oil/balm. I have been using it for a month twice a day and there is still so much of the bar left, it looks practically new still. Only reason I took off a star is because I have gone plastic free and the bar was wrapped in shrink-wrap plastic within the cardboard box :("
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Great for Sensitive Skin!,"Love it so much. I've been using this for the last few years with my Foreo mini and would highly recommend it. I have some adult acne and am sensitive to a lot of cleansers, but this keeps my skin balanced and removes all the dirt, makeup and gunk (in combo with my Foreo). Super easy to travel with. No worries of leaking liquid cleanser. I purchase this in bulk and store them at home. Would highly recommend!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Worth it,I have very sensitive skin. It is gentle and I use it 5-7 days a week! It has also lasted me 6-7 months!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,changed my skin for the better!,"This bar and the JuJu bar have been phenomenal for me. I used Boscia charcoal cleanser until about 2.5 years ago when I tried these bars out on a trip (super convenient to fly with!). I’ve always struggled with breakouts (deep, hormonal pimples) but changing to these bars made my skin get much better. They also last forever - just make sure they stay dry between uses."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Perfect for combination skin and great value!,"When I was sort of on a mission to reduce my plastic usage, I started trying different face cleansing bars. I first tried the travel size of DE's pekee and juju bar combo and liked them all right. I went to to try many more facial soaps and pretty all of them made my skin super dry after cleansing. After that I went back to this pekee bar and have been using it since then. It may seem expensive at first for a soap bar but it lasts forever. One regular size can pretty much last a year. I have combination skin so the juju bar is too dry for me and this one is mild and perfect. My skin is dry but can turn into an oily mess as the day goes. It is always difficult for me to find a product that has a right balance for combination skin but so far I think this bar serves the purpose of going green as well as perfectly suitable for my skin type and does its job well. I could literally go without any products after using this bar (proof that it is not drying) which I could never think of doing in the past."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Amazing!,"Holy cow, where has this been all my life?!  A bar soap that is gently and moisturizing for the face? - who knew?  This is so gentle on your skin, yet it cleans thoroughly and feels so luxurious and creamy!      I have repurchased this several times - it’s that good!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,This thing has lasted forever! I usually wet my face and then rub the bar on my cheeks for a bit of lather so the bar doesn’t get super wet. It is the only face wash that I’ve noticed actually minimizes my pores! I have acne and eczema prone skin and this gentle bar works well. Also great for traveling since it’s not a liquid!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,left my skin with dry red patches,"Disappointed with this product since I usually love DE products. After using this bar 3 days in a row my face started to become itchy and red. Eventually I had dry patches on my forehead around my eyes and around my mouth. This was the only product I changed in my usual routine so I know it had to be the culprit. I have combination skin but I only experience dryness in winter, and never this extreme. It’s June so weather is not the issue. Would not recommend at all."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,good,Best facial bar I've found. Doesn't strip the oils from your face and doesn't make your eyes sting.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Love it!,"I loveeee this bar. I have adult acne, cystic acne and this has done wonders for my skin. I have tried all the chemicals in the world to treat it and it always did more damage than good to my skin. I never intended to use this soap to treat it but it has and is. I never knew something so simple could work magic, especially for me. I does dry out my skin a bit right after but if you have a good moisturizer, this isn’t a problem.1"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Love.,"Love this bar cleanser. I have been using this product for over a year and a half and It provides a deep clean feeling and lasts a long time. This cleanser is even better than their Beste jelly cleanser, is more affordable and lasts significantly longer."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,I take it with me everywhere!,"I really like this cleanser!! I have skin that's more on the dry side, and so quite a few cleansers feel too stripping for me — causing peeling and acne. This is a lifesaver. I use it after a cleansing oil, to really make sure I've removed all of my makeup and got any dirt out of my pores. It's very gentle and foams well. It also doesn't have fragrance, which is pretty hard to find!!  Would definitely recommend this. TLDR: super gentle, cleans well, great for travelling."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,"I have very sensative, achne prone, dehydrated oily skin. If my skin is not properly hydrated it becomes both oily and flakey. It's a great time.
Guess what happens when I use this bar."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,"So I'm a little bias- I love all the Drunk Elephant products I've tried, but this one is my favourite. My face feels thoroughly cleansed and doesn't leave a filmy-like residue on my skin after. Will continue to be my go-to face wash"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Long lasting gentle face soap,"Lasts FOREVER and is a really good basic everyday face wash. It doesn’t smell, doesn’t hurt your eyes and I feel very clean and fresh afterwards. Seems good for sensitive skin and like I said, it’s a great gentle everyday product."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,I thoroughly enjoy using the product. It has a slight citrusy smell & leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean wo feeling dry or too tight. I’ve had this issue with cleansing bars in the past. My blackheads have gone down significantly since starting this bar.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,cleans face without over drying.,"I love this product. I have combination skin, oily forehead but a very dry nose area. This bar does a great job removing the oil without drying my nose area. I’ve been using this bar, in conjunction with my foreo mini at night. Ive noticed my skin is smoother and has a healthy glow."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Non-Drying & Clean,"A must! Small 1oz, once a day, lasted ~5 months. This bar I cut in half to share with a housemate. Non-drying, no breakouts for my combination skin. Entirely cleans spf 30 tinted BB :)"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,left me dry & rashy,I really wanted to like this stuff because I’m trying to use more sustainable beauty products. But #1 it comes wrapped in plastic which is a big bummer. #2 it left my skin feeling dry and with a red bumpy rash around my mouth. Only used for a few days before I went back to the Soy Fresh Cleanser. What a shame!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Great Bar!,"This has become my go to face wash, I have bought it several times now.  I love that its a bar and so the plastic footprint is less. It doesn't dry me out or leave any residue. Its pretty gentle, so it may not get all my makeup off on its own.  It doesn't aggravate my acne or rosacea."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,My favorite skincare product!,"Pekee is the only cleanser I have used for the past 2 years now. I have oily, sensitive skin and I find this thoroughly cleansing and soothing. I very rarely breakout anymore except for some hormonal acne. Overall, it helps me with just about every issue - redness, breakouts, sensitivity, oil, scarring."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,"The only cleanser I’ll ever use! Leaves my skin clear, nourished and balanced, and I have dry acne prone sensitive skin."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,not for dry skin,"Not for dry skin, I had to return this since it made my skin super dry. I have mix skin with dry areas"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Favorite DE Cleanser,"My favorite DE cleanser.  It cleanses (with lovely small suds when you add water), and has definitely made my skin smoother and in my experience it has reduced any breakouts I've had (mostly as a result of my skin purging from other products).  It may leave my skin slightly dry but that's not a problem for my skin, as I definitely use DE products to keep my skin"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Best gentle cleanser I’ve tried,"I bought this in the travel size along with the Juju Bar, however I’ve gotten away from physical exfoliants (great for back though). I have extremely oily skin and I don’t mind the oily look but this bar is amazing. It cleanses my skin so gently and the travel size one has lasted me for like 3 months already and I still have a lot left. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight, maybe firm but definitely not like I’ve gone thru a wind tunnel. It gives me a nice radiant look after I pat dry and it doesn’t break me out at all. I have very large pores so I used to get acne quite frequently and my pores get clogged easily but this cleanser is great for everyday and I use it both morning and night. I use other products for my acne but other gentle cleansers have irritated me due to fragrance or essential oils and this one just leaves my skin so fresh and clean. It even calms redness which I appreciate. Big recommend."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,"Goodbye, other cleansers","As a huge fan of creamy cleansers, I wasn't sure how much I would like this. I started with the mini version, which I found super useful for traveling, and eventually began using that one at home daily. I bought the bigger version and have been using it for nearly 4 months - sometimes twice a day (morning and night) - and I still have half of it left. I love how clean my skin feels without being stripped of all moisture (I have DRY skin). I use a moisturizing toner and oil/moisturizer combo after. I definitely need to exfoliate 3-4x a week, and this won't remove stubborn makeup on its own, but overall I love it and you can't beat the price point for how long it lasts. I keep it in a square soap tin from L*ush, which works great."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Gentle but effective,"Great at removing oil and makeup without being too stripping. Does not irritate my skin at all. I also love that its a bar, and not a liquid soap that required a lot of wasteful plastic packaging...which is nearly impossible to find in effective skincare."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,NOT A FAN OF THE BAR.,"Apart from stripping the skin and immediate dry patches, storing this little guy was a pain in the butt."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Gentle Cleanser,I’ve been using this bar for nearly 3 years now! And have to say it works really well for my combo sensitive skin. It’s super gentle without stripping. I highly recommend it for those that want a gentle wash :)
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Love,"Guys, this bar is fungal acne safe! I have been using it all summer and stopped to try another brand.... acne came back. back on this bar. I have the travel set and the mini is still lasting me! 6 months! I just bought the full size to top up because of the sale.

I also use this to wash my face masks because I know it won't irritate or break me out. 

I have spent HOURS searching ingredients on skincarisma and 2 other sites... this bar (not the exfoliating one) is SAFE!
There's only a select few options for FA ppl like me... this bar is great without drying me out. Also, there's something so satisfying about an actual soap cleanser and not some water/oil/cream cleansers that have dominated the market over recent years. I love this bar.
Cheers!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,I have combo oily skin and after I would wash my face with this it would feel tight (slightly drying for me) it’s also a little hard to lather. It did keep breakouts away and made my skin look beautiful
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Works!,"LOVE this face wash! Like LOVE! I’ve used it before but stopped using the brand to save money. I’m 29 and struggle with moderate acne, especially when it’s that time of the month. I’ve been using it again for a month and I noticed my face clear up within a week. I can’t believe that I wasted time and money on other products that don’t work. I also use the C firma and love it. When the VIB sale happens I will get the framboos and probably the Juju bar as well. The brand isn’t cheap, but the results are amazing and take the headache out of constantly searching for products that will work. I’ve found them!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,I LOVE this cleansing bar. I got the Pekee JuJu travel duo because I couldn’t decide between the two and this bar has left my skin feeling so clean but not tight or dried out. I’m so impressed because I have combination skin and struggle to find a cleanser that can control my T Zone but not dry the rest of my face out. Would definitely recommend! Get the mini duo if you’re unsure :)
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,"Great, lasts forever.","Cleans my face, keeps it soft, doesn't irritate my highly sensitive skin."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,"This is probably the best cleanser I’ve come across, and I’ve tried many for my oily skin. It’s gentle and moisturizing, and my face never feels tight after washing. It also lasts an incredibly long time. I buy the mini and it lasts many months. Of all the DE products, this is my top pick along with Protini."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Do not buy this!,"I use the entire DE line only, and I just bought this soap because I love the Beste jelly so much that I decided to give it a try thinking that it was another DE product. WRONG!! 
This thing is awful, it stripped my skin, it make it so dry and I got patches everywhere from it hurting my skin. It feels like a cheap hotel soap bar. It’s really bad, don’t waste your time and money buying this!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Best facial cleanser I've found,I have been using this for years and have never come across any other cleanser that can beat it for my oily and acne-prone skin. It provides the perfect balance of clean skin without being overly drying. Over time I think it has helped contribute to balancing my oiliness. Plus it lasts forever and it is so easy to travel with because its a solid bar. I buy the minis for travel and love them too.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,My skin is really dry during winter and I was very cautious on picking a cleanser as it can make it drier. I use this twice a day and my skin did not dry out at all compared to many other cleansers that promise the same thing. This is very gentle and it goes a long way. I have been using it for 4 months now.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,MY FAV CLEANSER,"Coming from someone with very dry, acne prone, and sensitive skin, this cleansing bar is my favourite. Truthfully, I never leave reviews much because I never get around to it but I had to for this product. I have been struggling with acne prone, very dry, and sensitive skin and the amount of money I have wasted on products that just ended up in the trash (because they affected my skin badly) has been ridiculous. I decided to come back to this brand because I did receive a sample once for their gel cleanser, so I thought why not - and let me just say it truly SAVED MY SKIN. It's such a nice, gentle cleanser and usually I always have a problem whether a product tingles or maybe itches or something but this felt so gentle and clean if that makes sense! Seriously, I can't recommend it enough!! I also bought their lala whipped moisturizer to use with it and omg it's amazing.. both products are so gentle and hydrating and my skin feels so nice, and the bonus is, I feel more confident in my skin when I decide not to wear makeup, it's so nice!! I had to share my experience with it because skincare is so important to me and I've broken down so many times because so many products have damaged my skin in numerous ways so yeah this product is so nice to have in my skincare routine :) (both morning and night for me!)"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Clean and amazing,Amazing - simple soap that leaves my skin feeling amazing and very clean without drying.  Highly recommend
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Great for sensitive skin!,I absolutely love this cleanser! It has almost no scent and  works great on my sensitive skin. My face doesn’t feel like it’s stripped after cleansing too. I’m on my third bar already!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Squeeky clean feeling,"Love how gentle this is, it cleans well but doesn't dry  my face out at all. I use it with the protini moistureizer afterwards and its my one two combo"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,Been using this product for years. It is the only cleanser that doesn’t strip my skin but manages to do its job and clean well. I think this is hands down better than the gel cleanser. I use this along with the exfoliating cleansing bar. This also lasts FOREVER and is easy to store and travel with. Huge win.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,"I have been using the Pekee bar on and off for several years now. I’ve ventured out and tested other cleansers (YTTP superfood cleanser), but I always find myself coming back to this one. I have super reactive skin that’s extremely sensitive, and this bar never causes any irritation or flare ups. Your skin is left clean, refreshed and hydrated."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,"Love DE, Don't love Pekee.","I am a DE die hard, but this product is one of my least favorites in the entire line. I have dry skin and this left me feeling tight and broke me out. Now it's the most expensive hand soap I've ever owned."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,"Great cleanser, wish it was vegan","This bar is amazing. I have sensitive acne prone skin and this helps my face feel really clean without feeling tight or stripped. This also has the added benefit of being much less wasteful than a typical cleanser cases in plastic. It seems it will last a long time as well. I have been using it twice a day for about a month (and I really get a good lather) and it is nowhere near even halfway done.

I just wish that DE would make a similar formula that is vegan. Unfortunately because this bar is not vegan I will be looking for a new cleanser when I need to refill."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,My everyday cleanser,"I love it. it's gentle and smooth. I use it to cleanse in the morning and night. Also when before and after waxing my facial hairs (it does a great job preventing breakouts). One of the best things about this is that it lasts long, 4 whole months using it 2 times a day (sometimes I use it 3 times a day if I'm going to the gym in the morning), so it's definitely worth the investment."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Gentle and moisturizing,I love how gentle this soap is on my skin. It’s a really great consistency and it feels good on your face. Perfect for sensitive skin.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,I am super happy to have found a clean facial cleanser that does not irritate my sensitive skin.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,"This is the best cleanser I have EVER tried, gentle, unscented, removes everything and doesn’t burn your eyes! It also lasts a very long time"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,I've been using DE skincare for 1.5 years and love them. The soaps are amazing. I love this bar because of how creamy the lather is and how squeaky clean my skin feels after using it. This in combination with the JuJu bar and Slaai Cleansing Balm are amazing. I have super oily skin with breakouts and blackheads. My skins feels smooth and fresh after each use.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,bad reaction,Red and bumpy... That's what happened when I used this product the times in one week. It's unfortunate that my snub had this reason because it's the first product I tried from this line.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,I use this bar daily along with another fave wash and I love it. It seemed expensive for a bad but it’s lasted me months.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,The Pek(ee) of Bar Cleansers,"The best bar facial cleanser I've used. If you have sensitive, dry skin this is it. It makes a gentle creamy lather so it is cleansing without being stripping. It also has an elephant on it so I don't know what more you could want."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Great for combination acne prone skin!,Glad I found this! it works so well with my combination acne prone skin. every other brand I've tried would cause dryness and irritation. I actually have experienced less breakouts since using this product. This along with the virgin marula oil has been such a game changer for me!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,"Amazing cleansing bar for step 2 of double cleanse. It lasts a very long time. I’ve taken it camping as it’s so nice to just have a beautiful easy cleanser when in the bush lol 

Negatives- 0"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Malaysia,My favorite,I love that this doesn't contain the harsh chemicals and fragrances that other cleansing soaps do! Love it
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Singapore,Great!,To be honest this cleanser i really like  it. I Dont feel tight or peeling sensation on my skin. After washing i feel fresh and my skin so smooth. I will keep repeating buying this bar soap! 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Malaysia,LOVE IT! ,"At first, I bought this soup because of good reviews. But when i finally use it, I finally understood. Love the soup, I feel super ""green"" because of no bottle plastic etc. I cut them into smaller pieces and it really economical. Love the texture. Will definitely buy it again. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Philippines,Ms,"This is a good everyday cleanser for combination skin. It’s not drying. It does not clog pores. This is good for second cleanse. I’ve used at least 3 bars of this product.
"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Malaysia,love it ,"I had some doubts purchasing this. besides finding a right soap container to store the pekee bar, i love this cleanser. I've been trying cleanser after cleanser looking for the right
one and pekee bar it is! it doesn't strip away your natural oils, and it removes my make up. Will totally repurchase this again "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Philippines,Pekee and Juju Bars - both staples!,"I have been religiously using Pekee and Juju bars and both are very versatile. Pekee is my go-to cleanser at night after going make-up free the whole day, while I make sure I use Juju at least thrice a week to exfoliate. I love how Pekee is very gentle, and it doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry nor tight."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Singapore,Good cleanser,This is a really good product! I’ve been using it for 2 weeks now and I feel that it doesn’t make my skin feel tight. It’s at a good price point as well as bar soaps tend to last much longer 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Singapore,Great product ,First product I've purchased from this range and I really like it. It does seem a bit pricey but it is a large bar and you do not need to use much. Does not dry out your face and better for the environment than bottle cleansers. Just what I was looking for! 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Singapore,LOVE THIS,"It’s great for dry skin types, most other cleansers out there really tug at my skin so I always stick to cream cleansers only, but this is incredible. My skin feels like mochi after cleansing. Plus points for being environmentally friendly. Only thing is, bars of soap are generally not that hygienic ~ 😥"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Singapore,I love it.,"This is my second purchase. It doesn't dry my face after washing, though I avoid my lips because it can get very dry.

I have dry skin and my rashes acts up once in awhile, especially on my arms and the back of my neck. On days when my skin feel very irritated, I will use it to cleanse and it helped to calm my skin. The bar soap is very versatile. Though storing can be a hassle if you don't have a proper soap dish to dry it properly."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,,Ms,Quite pricey but another DE product that I do not regret buying. Would definitely repurchase once almost finished with this soap. Worth the price especially for those with sensitive skin like me.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Kind to my face!,Love this bar.  GREAT for travel.  I am hooked! Soft skin and takes off all my eye makeup too!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,Great soap. Non-drying. Long lasting. A soap dish/case would make it even better. Highly recommend.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Most essential part of skin routine,"I was skeptical about a soap bar for my face (germs/bacteria) I tried it and fell in love. It removes my makeup, foams up very nice and leaves my face feeling clean and never dry - I suffer from more dry skin than normal. I sometimes stray and try new cleansers but I keep coming back. I've been using them for five years already. I use both bars. The Juju in AM and Pekee in PM to wash off my make-up."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,BUYER BEWARE - NOT A CLEAN PRODUCT!!!!,"I was SHOCKED when I received this product and it stated on the label ""WARNING: Avoid direct contact with eyes.  If contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with warm water"" - THIS is CLEAN?!?!!?!  I see this warning label on my TOXIC household cleaning products!!!  The company itself would not answer my question when asked about the warning label!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Not in love.,"It does it’s job, nothing too special about it. 
I find that it dries out my skin so I don’t use it every day. 
Ehhh. Not too impressed."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,CUTS THRU MAKEUP,"Gentle enough on my face to use everyday. This is my go-to nightly cleanser for my combo skin. I follow up with the rest of the DE line and have had incredible results.

It’s a little on the pricey side but it does last a long time! 

I love how this cleansing bar will cut through a full face of make-up with no trouble at all."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,My Favorite Cleanser *heart eyes*,"This is weird. It's now my favorite cleanser.... a bar... of soap... is my favorite thing for my face. But my skin doesn't lie. 

This bar soap feels so freaking amazing on my hands when I moisten it, lather, and WONDERFUL on my face. It doesn't take much water or lathering of the bar itself to get enough on your hands for a thorough cleanse- which was surprising for me btw. And the bar doesn't necessarily stay super moist after, just dripping product down into the soap dish. It actually kind of dries up quickly and gives you the piece of mind that it's not a waste of product... That was my main concern with my first purchase of this (and JuJu)... that it would feel like a waste. And it's not at all.

Secondly, I was concerned that it would be weird and messy to cleanse with a soap bar. I mean, who even does that anymore? I don't even use bar soap for my hands unless it's that spa stuff at a fancy hotel. 

In some weird way, cleansing with this soap doesn't feel awkward. The soap, like mentioned above, is super soft and feels so unbelievably nourishing on your face. My face doesn't feel like it's just been soap-stripped. In fact, it almost feels like I've actually just moisturized recently (without the residue). I absolutely love this. I actually get excited to use my Pekee bar (and the JuJu). As long as DE keeps this product the way it is, I can't see a reason why I've ever change out my cleanser now. 

I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to take a chance on a bar of soap again."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,GOODBYE ACNE,"I’m confused about people saying this is drying. Do you all care for your skin otherwise? Because this bar isn’t drying at all and my skin is super sensitive and dry during these winter months. I also happen to struggle with hormonal acne, and there’s very few products out there that touch it. This cleansing bar has made a HUGE improvement in my skin and has my hormonal acne breakouts almost completely controlled. It’s gentle, has no scent, lathers beautifully, and leave you soft and ready for your skincare. Use along with other clean products (toner, serum, oil, moisturizer) and watch your face transform after a couple weeks of use. I highly recommend this product. After trying most of the cleansers offered by Sephora, this IMO is the best option by far."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,LOVE THIS SO MUCH !!!!,"LOVE this cleansing bar.  I love a great cleansing bar--best one yet.  NARs made one a long time ago then stopped--I've been looking for one ever since,"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Really great cleanser,"This is such a wonderful cleanser. I was looking for an alternative without so much packaging (although this does come wrapped in a bit pf plastic). It is very light, not stripping like some bar cleansers can be, and leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized and not dry and tight. Gets off makeup well. I do not struggle with acne so I cannot speak to its ability to clear pimples. But I have combo oily/dry sensitive skin and this was perfect. Also very travel friendly, just picked up a little travel soap case, no spills!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Broke me out,This bar broke my skin out.  I got itchy bumps. I have combo skin.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Love it,"Gentle and effective, with repeated use I notice I have a more even skin tone. If you have breakout prone skin I’d use this as a second step in a double cleanse or wash twice with it. I’ve stopped looking for a cleanser and have repurchased the full size after the travel duo. It’s just lovely!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,the best,The best! Has changed my skin along with the juju bar. Perfect product !
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Gentle and Good for Traveling,I purchased the normal size immediately after trying the travel size. I prefer this than the scrubbing one.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,,pekee bar,I love the drunk elephant pekee bar. I use this soap every night and day. It makes my skin really smooth. You could save a lot when you buy this soap because it would really last long. I’ve been using mine for a few months now and i’m really satisfied.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,"Why does Sephora persist in calling this product vegan? It contains honey, therefore it's not vegan."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,Drunk Elephant Pekee Bar™,Very gentle on my sensitive skin. My skin felt so clean without that tightness that seems to come with washing your face with a bar soap. It got rid of all traces of makeup including mascara.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,,OK,"This is the first time I have used facial soap, quite impressed. I thought it might have harmed my skin but the ingredients made me change my mind. So far it does what it says, besides cleansing, I haven't seen any other obvious results."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,USA,extremely small square,This bar is a very small square. I was really shocked when I saw how small this product was for the price. Has no sent whatsoever
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,,Moisturising ,"After using this product, I didn’t  have the tight feeling, it calmed my skin and also balanced the oily parts of my skin. I had less breakouts after using it. Really happy to see Sephora having this clean product that really suits my skin. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Best Cleaning Bar,"I used the Clinique cleansing bar religiously in my 20s.  In my 30s I wasted a lot of money on products with too much fragrance, too much packaging and just plain over priced.  Learn from my mistake and just try the Pekee Cleansing bar.  It does exactly what it claims, it is gentle, thoroughly cleans, minimal packaging and lasts forever.  If I am wearing makeup, I use the Tatcha cleansing oil to take off my mascara and overall massage my face before I use this.  It works great!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Completely drying,"I wouldn’t use this product everyday. 
I have relatively normal skin and this soap DRIESSSSS out my face soooo bad to the point where it makes it feel bumpy. I have tried it with and without using moisturizer after and same thing which is a shame cause the reviews have been so good."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Pekee Bar™,Canada,Worth it,"Let me be the first to say that high-end skincare is usually full of potentially irritating ingredients, and is so often not worth the price tag. 
That is not the case for this product. It cleanses my skin without making it feel dry whatsoever, and the fact that it doesn't contain fragrance or pseudo-scientifically acclaimed ingredients is a win for me.
To save money I tried using a comparable drugstore version of this, but it dries me out.
Verdict? If you're okay with using a bar formulation for your daily cleanser, I definitely recommend. 

(Side note: If you don't know how to travel with this kind of product, I grab some tin foil and wrap it up with that!)"
BYBI BEAUTY-Milk Melt Cleanser,New Zealand,I actually really like it,"I was a bit hesitant to buy this as it didn't have the best reviews but after reading the ingredients and doing some research I decided to give it a go. I suffer from Malassezia Folliculitis and this is the first gentle cream cleanser I have found that doesn't worsen the condition. It is best if you massage it in well, so it almost starts to foam as this gives a really good clean feel. Perfect in the morning or any other time your skin only has light products on that you want to wash off or if your skin is feeling dry. "
BYBI BEAUTY-Milk Melt Cleanser,Australia,Gentle cleanser,"This cleanser was super gentle and struggles to remove make up, especially long wear products. may be nice and hydrating for those that do not wear make up, have super sensitive skin or specifically want to buy vegan. "
BYBI BEAUTY-Milk Melt Cleanser,Australia,A little disappointed…,"I was using the Milk vegan moisturiser before I bought this one, I loved it, it had such a nice texture and left my skin smelling slightly of vanilla and looking fresh. So I though this one might be similar. I was very wrong. The texture of this cleanser is too watery, once your done it hardly feels like you washed your face at all… sorry to say but I’ll definitely be switching back to the Milk one…"
VOTARY-Clarifying Cleansing Oil - Rosemary And Oat,Australia,In love,First time using an oil cleanser for me and I'm converted! Was sceptical beforehand but this product clears pores just as well as chemical exfoliants I have used in the past but isn't drying so also prevents re-clogging pretty nicely. Have been getting away with using only 1 pump as opposed to the recommended 4 so product can be stretched out a bit longer
VOTARY-Clarifying Cleansing Oil - Rosemary And Oat,Singapore,amazing,"great deep cleanser, really helped with my cystic acne outbreak a couple months ago. i used it a few days ago after starting to have another breakout, and i found that almost half of the blackheads on my nose fell out after massaging it in for 2 mins or so. very relaxing experience if you follow the ritual. doesn't dry your skin out at all. the only issue is that it's meant to be followed up by other oil-based products, and i usually use gel/water-based ones, and it can be quite rich, so i use i once a week, or twice at most if I'm breaking out."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Anti-Aging Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Australia,You better like peaches,"This is a gentle and effective oil cleanser that emulsifies very easily. It has a super strong scent of peaches which can be really off-putting. The pump dispenses a lot more than you need, so go easy so you don't waste half the bottle. "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Anti-Aging Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Australia,I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND,It is a bit disappointing as I heard this is a good brand for skincare. Not too good experience using about it for a week. Just finish it off so that it won't go wasted. The Sephora cleaning oil is much cheaper and better. 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Anti-Aging Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,New Zealand,so lux!,I double cleanse at night and this product is my first step. Feels amazing with texture and removes make up well in first step. It has a beautiful fruity smell which I love. Skin feels soft after rinsing
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Anti-Aging Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,New Zealand,.....,"I cannot begin to tell you how much I love Peter Thomas roth, the vit c moisturizer, the peeling gel the pumpkin enzyme mask.  But this was one of the biggest let downs I've come across.   My eye make up stayed in place, even after holding down cotton pad after cotton pad over my eyes to soften my mascara. My eye makeup looked as fresh as it did in the morning.  Immediately after I reached for my trusty cotton pads and micellar water and much to my discust and multiple pads later removed my eye makeup.... but also removed a whole lot of foundation that was left behind by the POT cleansing oil.  Really did nothing at all.   The only reason it gets one star is because my skin felt really soft afterwards.  If you are a heavy makeup wearer or Like me look for the industrial strength mascara and lipstick then this is not the product for you."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Anti-Aging Makeup Removing Cleansing Oil,Australia,really love this product ,"This is my new favourite oil cleanser . This product is so good and leaves your skin feeling really soft. I love how it works. Be careful not to go near your eyes as it can make your eyes go really blurry and sting, guess the same as any cleanser "
JUICE BEAUTY-Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,Canada,clean and gentle,"Very clean and gentle. I love that I don’t need to use separate makeup remover and this cleanser does the job. It doesn’t leave my skin dry at all. I have sensitive skin, and I feel refreshed and clean after use. I’ll use this going forward."
JUICE BEAUTY-Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,This is my first product from Juice Beauty. I’m so happy with it that I just went out and bought a few more products. Excellent cleanser leaves my face feeling clean and doesn’t overly dry it out
JUICE BEAUTY-Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,I like that it's a vegan product but I don't like the citrus smell and it made my skin tingle in a way that I did not enjoy. I do have sensitive skin so I believe it's due to the fruit extracts used.
JUICE BEAUTY-Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,Canada,A little goes a long way!,The best cleanser I have ever used. I use it after a precleanse balm in the evenings and it would get all the dirt and makeup from my pores. It stung a little the first time I used it but other than that there is no reason not to love this cleanser
JUICE BEAUTY-Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,Canada,Best cleanser ever,"I've been trying to switch to all-natural/organic skin products when I can, and someone at Sephora recommended this brand to me. I started off by just using their moisturizer but have now switched (almost) all my skincare products to Juice Beauty and it was the best thing I ever did. I never had terrible acne, but since using this cleanser my face has cleared up completely and I never get any major breakouts anymore! Also, it takes off my makeup much easier than other cleansers I've used. It's definitely worth the money."
JUICE BEAUTY-Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,Canada,"Leaves skin feeling tight, uncomfortable and dry.","I wish I could have loved this product. I’m currently detoxing my beauty products and tried this cleanser along with Juice Beauty’s oil cleanser at the recommendation of a Sephora Beauty Advisor. This cleanser is meh. It does cleanse my skin, but my skin has dried out and feels so uncomfortable since using it. I won’t be purchasing this product again."
JUICE BEAUTY-Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,This is probably the most I’ve paid for a face cleanser and I was decided on keeping only if I was truly in love with it. Turns out that i love it! I have dry skin and was worried that this would cause more dryness due to the lemon in it. But after washing my face with it I don’t feel that tugging at my skin that most cleansers that are too harsh cause.  The fresh lemony smell is an added bonus! This is my first purchase from this company and I will be buying this again.
JUICE BEAUTY-Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,Canada,Clean at Sephora!,Incredible cleanser. Natural and clean. I love it!
JUICE BEAUTY-Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,USA,Juice Beauty Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,"I have dry skin which needs a gentle cleanser in Winter. But in warmer temperatures, I need something lighter. 

This has been great for leaving my skin clean, smooth and soft. No dryness."
JUICE BEAUTY-Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Love this cleanser. I use it after I do an oil cleanse to get rid of all my makeup and I find it does a great job at removing the excess oil and any makeup that is left over! The scent is amazing and it never leaves me skin too dry (even when I use it without oil first), which is surprising since lemon juice is the first ingredient!"
JUICE BEAUTY-Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,USA,Best ever!,"LOVE! My skin is healthier and the rosacea/redness around my nose has become noticeably smaller and lighter. I look better without makeup (my new norm) and with. I use one pump morning and night. To increase exfoliation once in a while, I just apply with an organic cotton pad. I'm starting my third bottle and continuing to see gradual improvement. Expensive (and painful) laser treatments from a dermatologist didn't give me results like this. Rosacea is supposed to get worse as time goes by yet mine is getting better thanks to this. I'm a minimalist so I know the results are from this. I haven't met a Juice Beauty product I didn't love."
JUICE BEAUTY-Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,USA,Best Ever!!,Hands down my favorite cleanser. Was struggling with constant breakouts and every acne wash I was using dried out my skin and wouldn’t remove my makeup. This strips my makeup while leaving my skin hydrated and clean feeling. It has a light fresh sent and foams slightly. Skin has cleared up completely!! Which is a miracle in itself. I use this morning and night with the stem cellular moisturizer. So thankful!
JUICE BEAUTY-Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,USA,Juice Beauty Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,I’ve used quite a few different cleansers. This is by far my favorite.
JUICE BEAUTY-Stem Cellular™ 2-In-1 Cleanser,USA,Satisfied,"This is a low foam cleanser with a nice, fresh scent. It removes (almost) all makeup without stripping the skin. I still use an eye makeup remover to take off the remnants. Generally very satisfied and will purchase again. Being cruelty free and partially organic are very important to me."
SHISEIDO-Extra Rich Cleansing Milk,Malaysia,slimy after rinsing,"Quite on the fence with this product. It is gentle during cleansing but after rinsing it left a slimy feel on the skin. Would this make my skin breakout? I dont know and I have stopped using after a week, bcs I dont want to compromise my skin"
SHISEIDO-Extra Rich Cleansing Milk,Singapore,not the usual cleansing milk,This cleansing milk cleanse really well with a little water but will not suitable for me who likes to do a 2 step cleansing. Suitable for very dry skin
SHISEIDO-Extra Rich Cleansing Milk,Singapore,good buy,repeated buy! i always gravitate back to this given that the milk based consistency is more hydrating and doesn't feel like it strips my skin's moisture. good buy when on 20% discount
SHISEIDO-Extra Rich Cleansing Milk,,great but not best.,product lathers really well however i have issues with clogged pores hence have to cleanse thoroughly with cleaning milk!! wouldnt repurchase due to my skin type. but definitely would continue using it up every morning.
DRGL-Cleanser Brightening,Singapore,Gentle on Skin!!,"I’ve tried this Cleanser for a couple of weeks. Love how gentle it is on my super sensitive skin (I’m on isotretinoin)! I find that it evens out my skin tone, and helps to fade my acne scars. My skin feels clean without being stripped! Highly recommended!!"
DRGL-Cleanser Brightening,Singapore,Good,"I received the DrGL® Brightening Cleanser and tried it for the past week which has made my skin radiant! It leaves my skin feeling clean without drying it out. A little goes a long way, pea size pump is enough to cleanse my face"
DRGL-Cleanser Brightening,Singapore,DRGL cleanser brightening ,"I usually use DRGL products. My current face cleanser was finishing so I bought this. This cleanser really works and helps prevent pigmentation for me. I use a little pump each time, in the morning and at night. "
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,Clinique All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover - III/IV Very Dry To Dry Combination,"It doesn’t irritate my very sensitive skin, and does feel like it cleans decently well. Yet it doesn’t fully remove eye make up (especially mascara) which I was hoping it would."
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,Very happy with it,Great item! So glad Clinique came out with a micellar milk.
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,Gentle,Very nice creamy cleanser. Its removes all makeup and leaves skin feeling smooth.
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,Not for me,I only gave this two stars because it Did take most of my makeup off but it broke me out so much ): I’ve combo skin and this was a huge no for me.
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,Not Bad Clinique!,"Ok, not bad! This was a new purchase for me. I ran out of my isclinical cleanser and I picked this one up instead, the pink cap and it's not bad! I have oily skin and it didn't strip my skin, it actually felt pretty comfortable.  At first ot leaves a residue but when you wipe your wet face off with a towel, the residue is gone. It does have a milky texture but I kinda like it compared to a gel. I'll repurchase this!"
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,BEST MAKEUP REMOVER EVERRRRRRR,"I’m in shocked so many people don’t like this product. It’s AMAZINGGGGG. I love it, takes all my make up off, leaves my face soft and moisturized. Best thing I’ve ever used for make up remover, I’ll never use another thing. *Picture of my fresh face after use* I only used a small amount too"
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,Canada,Clinique All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover - III/IV Very Dry To Dry Combination,"This cleansing milk had a weird texture, and it always felt like it left a residue on my face. Also, even though it says nonacnegenic, it made my skin break out, and I don't normally have acne prone skin."
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,Clinique All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover - III/IV Very Dry To Dry Combination,"I’m surprised by the poor reviews on this product because I like it and thinks it works well. I rub it on my dry face with dry hands, then wet my hands and massage my face again, then rinse. Removes all my makeup. Also has a cooling feel to the skin so will be nice on a warm day. I used to use the Clinique oil makeup remover but I like this one better."
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,Just say No,Does not remove makeup. Will be returning.  Waste of my time and money.
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,Australia,not for me,Honestly did not find that this worked. It didn’t remove my makeup very well at all and made my eyes sting. What I did like is that it’s low fragrance and did leave my skin feeling moisturised.
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,Canada,Doesn’t remove any makeup,"I really was excited to try this and while it’s very calming on the skin, it doesn’t remove anything. Also feels like you’d have to use a lot and scrub your face to see any makeup being removed. Very disappointed!"
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,I will DEFINITELY repurchase,"I was slow to use any “milk” cleansers but this one is amazing !    I use it as a first cleanse to remove any product on my face, wash with a splash of water and then go in with my CerVe cleanser.   The directions dont require a 2nd cleanse but I prefer to do it.    I will definitely repurchase.  It has me doing a proper cleanse for the first time And NO IRRITATION of my “sensitive” skin."
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,Canada,Clinique All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover - III/IV Very Dry To Dry Combination,Love this cleanser! Use this at night to remove makeup and cleanse. I don’t wear foundation just Diors Dreamskin and blush... so I don’t need anything heavy duty. This is great for normal to dry skin! My skin feels clean soft and not tight. Highly recommended!! Cant beat the price too!
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,great creamy makeup remover,It works! I have enjoyed using this creamy product to remove my makeup. I like to do more than one cleansing step so even though it says “all-in-one” I always follow this with another cleanser or a gentle scrub. I definitely like it as a makeup remover :)
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,not what I was looking for,Weird consistency. Does remove the makeup but not what I was looking for
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,Malaysia,worth having and trying,"Not your regular micellar cleanser. Its texture is thick lotion but once you apply to your skin, it dissapears into your skin. Works well to remove light makeup/spf during the day"
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,Singapore,it's moisturizing,"I never used Clinique's previous milk cleanser product, but this is very thick. You need to wipe it with a tissue or cotton round, and follow it with a toner. It will not get your makeup off on its own, but it does leave the skin feeling very moisturized. I don't think I'd repurchase. "
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,Too thick,"This product replaced one I really liked--Take the day off milky cleanser. It is thicker, almost like cold cream. It does not go on as smoothly and lightly as the milky cleanser did and, because it is thick, is difficult to get out of the bottle which is stiff thick plastic. I am very disappointed and will not buy this again. (I'm stuck with the one I have because I bought it on sale and didnt try it until after the return date had passed.) I will be trying cleanser from different companies after this."
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,For dry skin,"This is great for dry skin. But it doesn’t take all the makeup off as it claims. You would need to use something else, such as micellar water afterward for a full cleanse. It doesn’t lather at all, think more like Ponds Cream than ‘cleanser’. Don’t buy if you need lather to feel clean.  My skin was left completely unstripped and I didn’t need moisturizer as much as before. However since I have combination skin, only the dry parts were impressed which makes sense because it’s exactly what the label says it’s for. Within a week my skin was more calm and not as tight."
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,Love it!,"First time using a Clinique product to clean my face and I am really pleased. Some people find that this doesn't clean well enough but in my opinion ( because I have tried other cleansers for dry skin) all cleansers for dry skin are super gentle to the point that it feels like they don clean at all. I don't like to wash my face and get all wet specially at night and that's why I use a damp washcloth to wipe off the cleanser. I always follow with my toner and it always removes dirt - even if I don't wear makeup, and even with other cleansers I still get traces of my foundation left on my face. So, I def. will continue using this for as long as they don't change the formula. Another thing, some say that it doesn't remove eye makeup but in my case I use four different mascaras each  time and this cleanser loosens up all of them althought it doesn't completely remove every trace, so I always use the Take the Day Off eye makeup remover."
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,happy shopper,"I've used the Clinique make-up removing balm and oil for a long time, but this is such an improvement! the texture is more of a thick creamy consistency, not what I think of as ""milk"", but very happy with this so far."
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,It's perfection in a bottle!,The only cleanser I have ever used that I wasn't immediately reaching for my moisturizer!  My skin felt clean but also actually hydrated. It took my mascara off in one round.  I did let it sit for about 15-20 seconds and it wiped right off without leaving any black residue.
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,Don’t get this!!,Didn’t get any make up off and left an oily residue
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,Don’t Wait! Try this now!,"This cleanser leaves your skin feeling so soft. I’ve always loved Clinique skincare and have been using it now for 20 years. I just had my 40th birthday a little over a month ago and as my skin has changed, so have my personal preferences regarding skincare. Clinique does not disappoint!"
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,USA,Worth having!,"So this is different from your average micellar cleanser, but in a good way. Its texture is thick/creamy like lotion but once you apply to your skin it disappears into your skin. I didn’t use a tissue to remove, instead I used my wash cloth and it did a pretty good job at removing the very little make-up I had on and all of the days dirt and pollution. My skin felt hydrated and smooth afterwards.

You may need to double cleanse if you wear full face of make-up but overall this is a great make-up remover if you’re in a rush for bed and would like to skip your nightly routine while still quickly cleansing your face. Or a great morning cleanser that’s also hydrating and doesn’t strip the skin."
CLINIQUE-All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover,Canada,Clinique All-in-One Cleansing Micellar Milk + Makeup Remover - III/IV Very Dry To Dry Combination,"I love all things Clinique so I bought this as soon as it came out. It’s very gentle and it doesn’t strip the skin. I have combination skin and sometimes can be quite oily at the end of the day. It’s not made to remove long wear makeup. If you wear lighter formula makeup this would be good for you. For me personally I prefer the Clinique cleansing balm as it takes everything off in one shot. I won’t be returning it, as it’s still a nice product, just not my preferred makeup remover."
DIOR-Capture Totale Super Potent Cleanser Anti-Pollution Purifying Foam,USA,Gray cleanser,I love this product. It smells really great and my skin feels really clean as if I exfoliated it.
DIOR-Capture Totale Super Potent Cleanser Anti-Pollution Purifying Foam,Malaysia,Nice foam cleanser ,The packaging is convenient no cap to open you just need to turn it to open. It has bit too strong scent I don’t really like but so far it doesn’t make any trouble to my skin.

DIOR-Capture Totale Super Potent Cleanser Anti-Pollution Purifying Foam,USA,La Mer Cleansing Foam Substitute,"I started out trying this face wash to find a cheaper alternative to the La Mer Cleansing Foam and ended up loving it even more than I thought I would. It’s nearly identical except it smells better and I don’t get ANY breakouts at all. Best face wash I’ve tried. One star off for the packaging, it doesn’t feel sanitary to rest the bottle on a wet surface in the shower when that’s where the product comes out of. The idea of bacteria collecting on the opening just feels counterintuitive. Great product, horrible packaging."
DIOR-Capture Totale Super Potent Cleanser Anti-Pollution Purifying Foam,Australia,capture totale super potent cleanser anti-pollution purifying foam,"capture totale super potent cleanser anti-pollution purifying foam - I think it cleaned well. However I don’t completely like the scent. It makes my skin quite dry afterwards compared to other anti pollution cleanser.

DIOR-Capture Totale Super Potent Cleanser Anti-Pollution Purifying Foam,New Zealand,The Best Foaming Cleanser EVER,"I love Capture Totale Serum & Cream and was given a sample of this to try before I bought the full tube. This cleanser is a game changer!! So gentle and moisturising, my skin feels so comfortable after rinsing, but my skin is 100% cleansed. You only need a tiny bit to foam up with water. Very subtle fragrance. I have always been a cream cleanser girl as foaming cleansers have always been too drying for me but this one is very different."
DIOR-Capture Totale Super Potent Cleanser Anti-Pollution Purifying Foam,USA,DIOR Capture Totale Super Potent Cleanser Anti-Pollution Purifying Foam,"A little goes a long way for this!

Very smooth . I repeated purchasing this products many times. Highly recommend! "
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Simply Amazing,"My mom got this and had me try it out. Now I've purchased my own! The scent is to die for and makes me feel so relaxed when cleansing my face. Doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy OR stripped of moisture after rinsing it off. Removes all traces of makeup, including waterproof eye makeup. Not only is this better for your skin than cleansing wipes, but it produces significantly less waste and a little of the product goes a long way."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Not Worth It,"• poor packaging, super annoying to get the lid back on
• deceptive packaging, you only get half as much product compared to the size of the tub
• unimpressive product, I used the entire tub & noticed NO difference in my skin...for $50??? NO THANKS."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,Gentle texture & nice scent ,Been using Farmacy make up remover before the Estée Lauder cleansing balm. It is much better than Farmacy! I like its texture as it can help to dissolve my make up gently. The scent is good too! Will repurchase it!
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,make up melts away... ,"This cleansing balm is easy to use, just apply all over the face, then wipes with the wet cloth...

Prefer this format to the oils because I don’t break out from it.  
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,AMAZING FOR DOUBLE CLEANSING ROUTINE,"This is an amazing balm to remove makeup. I use it as a first step in my double cleansing routine. The only reason I’m awarding this 4 instead of 5 stars, is because it doesn’t have an applicator or a spatula to grab the product,"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,Australia,Best cleanser,"I love using this Estee Lauder cleansing balm, it glides softly onto my skin, and removes all traces of grime and make up very easily. It feels fabulous on the skin and does not dry it out in any way."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Feels luxurious,"I usually go for foaming cleansers but also have dry skin.

ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Estée Lauder Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,"It's better to buy the elmis procollagene it's the best ever for removing make up  and the prices are similar ,but at least it comes with a towel and its smell is very relaxing and has natural ingredients and it leaves the skin very smooth ."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Great makeup remover,"If you're looking for a cheaper alternative, this has the same ingredients as the Clinique cleansing balm but with the following additions: Silybum Marianum (Lady'S Thistle) Extract , Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract , Algae Extract , Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) , Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) , Methyldihydrojasmonate , Bht , Linalool

I compared them out of curiosity bc they're both good products and the ingredients list is remarkably similar - makes sense since Estee Lauder owns Clinique"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,,My everyday use! ,"I used this everyday in the evening to remove make up before my using cleanser.

ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,,Not suitable for combo skin,"Much as I liked the product Initially as it thoroughly clean my skin and removed all make up effectively, after a week I realised it’s not suitable for my skin type.

ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Leaves my skin greasy,"Well, this balm does take off makeup effectively, especially when used with Clarisonic. However, I tried everything but still cannot rinse it off with water, while with some other products you don't need to wash your face again with another cleanser. Also, when my skin gets more sensitive during cold and windy days, this balm irritates my skin and leaves it red and itchy for a while. It's the kind of product that ""I won't let my mom use it."""
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,,"Soft, gentle and amazing",I've always used make-up wipes to remove my makeup but I wanted to look after my skin and start a skincare routine. This balm is amazing and gently removes every last bit of makeup on the face. It feels like applying soft butter to your face and is easy to wash off. Would recommend!

ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Estée Lauder Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,This removes face makeup ok but my Japanese mascara stayed put. Not as good as the farmacy green cleansing balm.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,,Splendid Cleanser,This cleansing balm functions like a gentle but effective make up remover. A little goes a very long way. It is better to use a small spatula to scoop an adequate portion of the product. It just melts wonderfully into my skin and takes away all the day’s make up etc. I usually wash it off with room temperature water. It makes my skin feel so clean and soft and not tight at all. I use it daily at the end of the day before applying my night skincare. I would definitely recommend this balm to my friends.

ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Cleared my acne,"so funny story I read Kendall Jenner’s skin care routine (I like seeing celebrity skin care rountines!) of course she’s the face of Estée Lauder but she also has or had really bad acne. Well, I bought this because I’m a lazy gal and want a makeup remover and cleanser all in one...I’m not sure if it’s the witch hazel in it but my skin cleared up within a week. I was not expecting that!!! I highly recommend this. I’ll provably use this for the rest of my life! It’s pricey but worth it. My skin is soft and no little bumps! Gets my mascara off and leaves no makeup trace! Perfection"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,LOVE,i’m a big fan of the korean skincare routine and this stuff has made night-time dual cleansing the bomb! it literally melts off your makeup!! this has the consistency of coconut oil and when you rub it in your hands to warm it up it turns into a silky smooth oil. i like to put it on by itself to rub off my eye makeup and foundation then i like to add the water to help turn it into a milky cleanser. this will forevermore be a staple in my cleansing routine!
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,,non greasy and gives nourishment ,I love this cleansing balm. Only a small amount enough for your entire face. It doesn’t dried out my skin but it does the cleaning job perfectly as it should. I only use this at night and day after day my skin condition is getting better. 
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Best Cleansing Balm,Most effective cleansing balm I have tried.  It is the 2nd time I have purchased.  It doesn’t take a lot of product to remove a full face of makeup.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,The best,"My new go cleansing balm. So lovely. Takes off everything. I like to massage it into my skin for a few minutes to give myself a mini facial massage and I can feel the stuff rolling out of my pores. Add a little water and it emulsifies beautifully. Didn't irritate my skin at all and left it soft and clean.
Decided to try this one because I wasn't fully satisfied with any others I had tried. 

It doesn't leave a film on my face like other cleansing balms have and if I get it in my eye I don't feel like I'll never see again (ahem farmacy).

All around great product. Will continue buying it."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,The only way to clean your face!,"I love this product!  It cleanses but leaves skin feeling moist, not dried out.  I typically just rub it in and use a wet washcloth to wipe off."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Magical Makeup Remover,"This is the BEST makeup remover EVER! 
Even the the most stubborn Smokey eye, red lip, or all day foundation doesn’t stand a chance against this cleansing balm. 
Makeup just MELTS as you softly swirl this product over face. Keep working in circular motions and the balm emulsifies into a lighter linguistics that easily rinses off. 
I have combo skin- and it doesn’t make me break out, and doesn’t make my skin feel greasy."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,LOVE,"This is THE BEST cleansing balm I’ve tried, feels great on the skin after. I love how easily my makeup comes off with it! Removes makeup better than makeup wipes remover."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Love,"So far I love it! It took me a bit to get used to using balm cos I had always used oil cleansing. 

But after using it, I can definitely feel my skin more moisturized and farm. The next morning my skin is so farm and I LOVE it!  

I will keep using it for sure."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Great makeup removing balm,This is lovely and soft and smooth and removes waterproof makeup perfectly.  It's more refined than the Clinique Take the Day Off balm.  Would repurchase this over the Clinique even with the price differential.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,So good!!,"I like this more than the Clinique cleansing balm. The feel and touch is luxurious, not oily at all and remove makeup so effective! Only complaint is the price, but other than that this is a perfect cleansing balm!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,,Dupe Alert,"I love this cleansing balm because it turns completely into oil once in contact with skin which allows me to really massage and remove all traces of makeup and sunscreen. however, I find that it is really similar to Clinique TTDO balm and The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter. As much as  I love it, I will only repurchase if there's interesting sales. Otherwise, for it's purpose, I will regularly use those cheaper dupes."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,,favourite make up remover,"One of my favourite make up remover, my skin feel clean and smooth after used, it will not cause my skin dry as it is a make up remover + cleanser, so i do not need to wash my face again with cleanser after make up remover.

ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,,Amazing cleansing balm,This product is the best for melting away all the dirt and makeup. It’s super effective and makes your skin feel supple and hydrated after cleansing. Love this for an extra step in making sure that your face is squeaky clean after a full face day. Keeps clogged pores away and smells so good too. Estée Lauder lover forever. 
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Nothing extraordinary,"This is nice for the winter when my skin is dry, but I think cleansing oils (especially tatcha or tarte brand) are better.  This didn't remove all my eye make up without maximum effort.  It's a perfectly fine cleanser, but it wasn't anything special"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Dreamy,This cleansing balm is fantastic and rivals my beloved Eve Lom cleansing balm. It removes makeup beautifully and leaves the skin so soft and smooth. Love!
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,WOW,"it is so smooth and soft. I use it to take off my matte lipsticks because theyre so difficult to come off and when i use makeup remover wipes it leaves my lips irritated. However this is heaven! It is so easy to take off my lipstick and leaves my lips soft and moisturized. I tried a similar product like this, however it was not as smooth as this product and did not take my matte lipstick as easily like this one. Expensive but worth it for my lips!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Good for cleansing - irritates eyes.,"I was so excited to try this product after learning about its ability to remove all make up with solid to blame texture whilst nourishing skin. Although the texture was lovely, every time I used this to take off eye makeup (I just use a small amount of mascara) I would wake up to completely blurry eyes due to the oily residue getting into my eyes even after I thoroughly rinsed off the product."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Luxurious cleansing balm,"I love this cleansing balm! It's silky soft and good for sensitive skin. A little bit goes a long way. It melts into the skin and removes all my makeup easily, including waterproof mascara. It feels like I'm giving myself a face massage. Add a bit of water for a deeper milky cleanse. I also like how it makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated after and not oily, which is great for my combination skin. This is a luxurious product that I would use once or twice a week for a deep cleanse and on days when I have a full face of makeup on. I also love the classy packaging!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Wow!  Delighted!,"I received this as a sample and immediately purchased a full sized jar.  This is the best cleansing balm I have ever used.  It goes on like an oil, sort of but not quite.  You put it on dry, massage it into your skin, and it immediately begins to take off all the makeup, even the most stubborn foundations.  No tugging on your skin, no pulling, just pure, gentle heaven.  Then you wet your skin and it foams into a nice lather and rinse.  It leaves no residue!  NO RESIDUE!  Hallelujah!!!  At long last!  I will buy this for as long as they make it."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Estée Lauder Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,"This is pretty legit, I loved using it everyday and was sad when I ran out. However, it was not THAT MUCH better than the Clinique take the day off or even Boscia makeup melter and it's between $14-$17 dollars more than each. It's not good enough to warrant the price jump in my opinion. However, if you are comparing to the Peter Thomas Roth gold makeup melt this is much better and saves you some money! It depends on what you are using now whether this is a deal or a splurge but I'd say it's not worth it if it's a splurge for you."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Hype is REAL,I am obsessed and have bought two of these in the last week. I have a feeling it's going to be hard to find in stock once the word gets out on how fabulous this is. I have very dry fussy skin and this is heaven to use each night. Plus the fact that you can use it with or without water to make it basically two different products is just genius science. It definitely is spendy but nothing takes off liquid lip like this. No tugging or burning as with wipes. Every trace of my eye makeup was gone and in the past I have always used a separate product in the past just for eyes but this does it all and a tiny bit goes a long way. Best product I have  found in a long time!
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Magic,"I had my doubts about this because I have SUPER oily combination skin. I'm so glad I feel for the hype. I've incorporated this into my skincare routine and it is magical! It completely dissolves all my makeup, leaving barely any residue on my towel when I dry my face. It also leaves my skin feeling soft and supple without a heavy, greasy feel. I wake up and my skin is refreshed and ready for its morning routine. Definitely pick up a jar! It's pricey, but it is SO worth it!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Great!,"A wonderful product! I use it to remove everything. It's super easy to use and leaves your skin feeling clean, soft and moisturized. I like that you can use with sans water and just apply then wipe off your make up with a towel or cleansing pads. Or add water to turn it into a milky cleanser and then wash off."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,the best,It is the best cleansing balm I've ever used. I have dry skin but it can make my skin be supple and hydrated after using it. It can also diminish my pores because I can clearly see my pores are pulling out by the balm.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Where has this been all my life?!?,"If it hadn't been for the recommendations of others, I would have never tried this! At night time, the last thing you want is waterproof eye makeup that is a pain to remove. So you can imagine my delight when I applied a tiny bit of this balm to my face, and it just melted everything away like magic. Granted, I don't wear heavy makeup to begin with, but I believe this formula would work on people who do apply more product as well. Most importantly, it smelled pleasant, felt lightweight, left my skin feeling not greasy and oh so silky smooth. I hate products that leave my skin feeling dry or irritated, and the fact that this product can do its job without any problems more than justifies the price. I predict this luxe, glass jar lasting for months, and it looks high end too. THERE IS NO BETTER CLEANSING BALM OUT THERE."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,UH-MAZING,"I absolutely love this cleansing balm. I have tried cleansing oils and it makes me skin feel clogged instead of clean after using it. But this balm has the perfect texture to it that melts all the makeup off my face. It even works for mascara and eye makeup.

I use a Sephora makeup wipe to remove it, but only because they are soft and gentle. This product does all the work on its own! And it does not make me breakout, which is a HUGE bonus."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,,Estee Lauder Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm - okay~,"I bought this as a replacement of Clinique's cleansing balm (which i love btw until recently they change the formula :(, )

Estee lauder's cleansing balm is more expensive than Clinique, thus i expected it to be better but its just normal basic cleansing balm. The texture is very similar to earlier version of Clinique's balm, and comes with a slight scent of, lavendar, i think?

It cleans decently, on waterproof eyeliner and mascara would require more effort, on both adding more balm and more massage, thus i find it just being okay.

"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Great cleanser,"This balm is a real diva product and for the ones who are serious about skin, you need it in your life The packaging is nice and product itself takes of every inch of makeup on your face. It says to avoid the eye area, but I use it on waterproof mascara and it does not sting my eyes whatsoever. I like that when you wet it, it turns into this milky soft liquid that you can further use as a cleanser. I just love it."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,French Lavender smell,"You have to put it on on dry skin that has make up, you wet your hands and scrub your face. I then turns into a milky frothy soft suds. It becomes a face cleanser. It smells amazing!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Estée Lauder Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,"Love this product so much! My skin feels so clean & amazing! I just purchased this product for the 1st time, I am sure it is my new fave!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Estée Lauder Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,"Legitimately amazed. I only use it on my eyes since it's so expensive but you only need the tiniest amount. No balms or makeup removers have ever gotten all of my eye makeup off, particularly mascara. No matter how much time I spend on removing my makeup I always wake up with some still on my eyes. Until this product! Please don't ever discontinue this."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,AMAZING!!,"This stuff is seriously amazing. First use, removed my entire face of makeup, including eye makeup - and I didn't even need to use a wash cloth - it emulsified amazingly!! There was no film left behind on my skin, and it didn't leave it feeling stripped at all. I can't wait to see how my skin improves after continual use."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,awesome,"oh my God, I love this cleansing balm so much. It is so soft and take off completely my makeup."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Worth the Price?,"This is a great emulsifying cleansing balm....I have nothing bad to say about it. It removes every single speck of make up- even water proof mascara.
I have been a loyal fan of Clinque's Take the Day Off, for years....I thought I would try the EL cleansing balm for comparison.
Like I said, this cleansing  balm is fantastic....it doesn't leave a greasy feeling after cleansing, it removes all of my makeup, it leaves my skin soft and moisturized, and it's smooth and not gritty.
Yet, so is Clinque's...so why am I spending 20$ more??
I will use the EL cleansing balm all up....every last bit, but will continue to repurchase Clinque's Take the day Off, because in my humble opinion? 
They both do an equally great job at removing every last drop of make up and not making my skin feel stripped...however, one does it for 20$ less."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,NEW HOLY GRAIL,This was a bit of an impulse buy..just grabbed it while browsing through my local sephora. This is serendipity at its finest. This literally took off every trace of my makeup. Nothing was there when I used my toner with a cotton pad afterwards. I already bought 2 back ups. just in case!
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Makeup Eraser,Excellent night time makeup remover. Gently erases all signs of mascara and leaves skin feeling moisturized. A little goes a long way. I like to use my Clarisonic and a light exfoliator after to prep for skincare but it's not necessary.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,This Cleansing Balm is Bomb!!!!,"Love love this balm. It takes all of those waterproof mascara and stay all day foundation. I have a really sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate mine it makes my skin feel so fresh and clean after I rinse it off with water. Thanks to Ms. Glam Life Guru Tati for recommending this product. Worth the money too, a little goes a long way. I still have a lot of product after using it for about a month now."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,This is EVERYTHING,"Use this cleanser by itself or as a makeup remover+cleanser in one as I do, and you will end up with baby soft, glowing skin at ANY age!!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,wonderful,"Scent not too strong, just right. Only need a little for your while face- and I use plenty of makeup on mine :) eyes included. Just bought it 11/1 I expect this to last through at least January. The best I've used."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,"Gets every last bit, and smells like a spa!","I can't say enough about how much I love this cleanser! It's gentle enough for my super sensitive skin as the colder, drier months begin, but still gets every last bit of makeup off - eve what usual would show up on the towel I use to dry my face. Very, very impressed!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,most underrated product ever..,This is the most loved product i have ever bought!! Love the packaging. So glamorous!! Love the product. It will remove every single trace of makeup. It removes loreal liquid lipstick like its a gloss! I used to rub my lips to death to remove these lipsticks. I will repurchase it again and again and.. Again! Its very gentle. I dont have strip off my skin to remove makeup. I use every night as my skin care routine wether or not i am wearing makeup. I feel like it deep cleanses pores and removes all the pollution and dirt too. My skin is dry and i would get dry patches around if i rub it too hard. I can not say enough about it. Thank u Tati Westbrook for recommending this. Buy it u wont regret it ever.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,WOW!,For me this product was a splurge but I don't regret it. The balm removes all makeup and rinses off fantastic without leaving the face with an oily residue feeling. I have dry sensitive skin and this product didn't make me brake out or dry out my skin. Will repurchase this great product!
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,This balm is amazing!,"This cleansing balm is so nice! Definitely worth the money. I have dry, sensitive skin and it is so good as getting all of my makeup off but not burning my skin or drying it out. This product is very nice. Definitely will re-purchase :)"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,Definitely Worth The Money,"I got a small sample of this and HAD to buy the full product. This stuff removes makeup so well! It also has a nice smell and is super easy to apply. My face feels so soft and clean afterwards. The best part is that a little goes a long way, so it's definitely worth the money."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,the best,I have been a Purity fan for years. I recently came across this product from watching a YouTuber who has the same skin type and is also the same age as I am. I do not regret this buy and will purchase this again. The makeup melts away so easily and my skin feels amazing afterwards. So much so that I don't feel the need to use oils or night cream.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,excellent. miracle makeup remover,This product is excellent for removing makeup . It takes 2 seconds and no extra cleaner needed. Must have
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,YAS,"removes makeup and cleanses in minutes, smells fresh, doesn't irritate eyes, light, moisturizing.

Removed my mascara, eyeliner, brow pomade with no removers beforehand! One more cleanse got all my DOUBLE WEAR off!!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm,USA,great makeup remover and cleanser,"Love this product for its portability for travel - no need to worry about size since it's not liquid!  It does a great job removing long wear foundation and face makeup. It takes a little work on eye makeup, and other cleanser/makeup remover combos I have used work better on the eyes. I love the way my face feels after though: soft and clean, not oily or stripped. I would definitely buy again, especially for travel!"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Singapore,works great but smells like ‘zambuk’,"This leaves my skin soft after cleansing and it also removes waterproof make up well.

However, this product smells v herbal and like the ointment ‘zambuk’.
 
If you can take the smell, this is great! I love that there’s 2 pieces of muslin cloth provided."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Singapore,Relaxing Balm,"I bought this huge tub after trying out a sample. This balm cleanser calms me down after a hard day’s of work and takes off even heavy makeup, leaving my skin feeling cleaned and not tight."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Philippines,best cleanser,"Admittedly, it does not smell great but I can look past that because everything else about this cleanser is fantastic. Paired with the muslin cloth & following instructions, it is so easy & effective in throughly cleansing my skin. My skin feels so soft afterwards. Perfect for those with dry, dehydrated or mature skin. It is worth the hefty price tag. "
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Singapore,good buy,i do like this balm - it removes my make up very well and a little goes a long way so it lasts. 4 stars only because it stinks.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Singapore,Nice,"Very good to use and fast delivery,it’s only took few days to delivered the product. Convenient for people who are interested to use app to purchase the product."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Singapore,Would repurchase!! ,"This removes every bit of makeup cleanly - even the waterproof ones. Feels comfortable on the skin, and skin feels very nice and clean after using it - not in the squeaky clean way but something more gentle. "
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Singapore,Buy this! ,"I bought this and never expect it could be this comfortable! The ingredients are good for my skin, and it have nature herb smell? Love this product! Recommended. "
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Singapore,Good cleanser,Good product..Send it as gift to my sister and she feedback that this cleanser working good and recommend anyone..will purchase in future to try it as well
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Singapore,Good cleanser,Good product..Send it as gift to my sister and she feedback that this cleanser working good and recommend anyone..will purchase in future to try it as well.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Singapore,the smell is terrible,"i like how it removes make up easily, but the smell is really terrible.. will prefer farmacy instead. think this brand is over advertised"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Singapore,Eve Lom Cleanser ,Nice cleanser. Do not cause any irritation to my sensitive skin so far. Perfect to use it with the cloth that come with cleanser.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Singapore,Eve Lom - Cleanser,"Probably the best cleanser I have tried to date ! It really removes make up and dirt off your face. The cleansing method is abit tedious but its
such a nice feeling after - kinda like exercise, its hard to start but nobody complains about it after its done. haha! would highly recommend this cleanser but the price is abit steep . "
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Singapore,expensive but Good!,"I bought this during the 1 for 1 promotion. I notice this cleanser is always OOS of the shelf  in sephora. This brand is expensive just as a cleanser. Bought this cleanser in jumbo size and surprisingly, i need to use small amount of it. Downside is they didn’t include spatula for the cleanser. It’s comes with 2 muslin cloth and was suppose to damp it hot to open the pores and damp it cold the close the pores with a duration of 5mins each use in the shower. I don’t like the texture and smell BUT i love how it leaves my skin brighter and moist. "
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Malaysia,pls bring it back on Sephora ,I have sensitive skin and this is my go to item! It get rids of all the makeup. I’m using it whenever I need to put on my makeup but I’m using it without the muslin cloth so that my face is clean “gently”. The cloth is use only once a week.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Singapore,cleanser,I love this cleanser. It can be used daily- where I just massage it in and wash off with warm water. I also use it for a deep cleanse twice a week where I use the cloth provided to massage it in. Skin feels soft afterwards.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Canada,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) the smell is way too overpowering. it smells like some sort of candy/medicine but not in a good way. the texture is too thick for my liking and has clumps?? but doesnt exfoliate my skin.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Canada,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,"Incredible cleanser. Definitely do not like the smell, but I can excuse it. This stuff softens my skin like no other and it's softness and hydration that LASTS. There are ""clumps"" in there help to exfoliate. Using it with the muslin cloth is great for removing makeup, and also for exfoliating. My skin is usually pretty sensitive and dry, with dry flakes that are difficult to get rid of, but not with this cleanser."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Canada,TERRIBLE smell and weird clumps,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Terrible smell and weirdest texture. My skin did feel nice ans clean afterwards, but it was very far from being worth the smell. Disgusting."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Canada,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,"The cleanser is so beautiful - thorough, yet doesn't leave my skin dry. Plus, the exfoliating effect of the cloth is fantastic."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Singapore,absolutely amazing product,"i honestly never thought a cleanser could make my skin look this good. i used my points to trial this and after using only a couple of times i ordered the full size product - i'm obsessed! my skin feels so smooth after cleansing with this, my pores are smaller and my skin has a gorgeous glow. the full size comes with a couple of muslins and a print out of the steps to follow which is a lovely bonus. i really am so excites to have found this!"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Helps my skin stay smooth,"I've been using this for a couple of years and it helps with getting rid of any dry, flaky patches. It's only okay in cleaning waterproof mascara, but my main use for this is helping get my skin soft and smooth. I also make sure to follow their instructions exactly to get the best result (looked up tutorials on Youtube)."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,It rinses away with water,"Ok, first things first: You do not have to follow the instructions that come with this cleanser; no need to leave the cloth on your face and use cold water to ‘close pores’. 

This is an emulsifying balm that rinses clean away with water. The cloth is basically optional. Apply it to dry skin, massage it around to remove makeup and sunscreen, then get some warm water in your hands and start massaging your face. The balm gets frothy and white and then you just rinse it away with warm water. The same way you use any traditional foaming cleanser. All those steps are just a bunch of faff. It leaves a clean, but not stripped, after feel. 

This is a nice emulsifying balm that does the job removing my makeup and sunscreen. It’s not magic, it’s not worth the price, and the superfluous addition of essential oils is annoying and potentially sensitizing to some skins. It’s great for travel, you can carry the small size pot around and refill it from the larger tubs. It works on the shower, at the sink, and it rinse clean away provided you flush it with plenty of warm water."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,"I absolutely love this product. It makes my skin feel so refreshed and clean. After using it by skin is so smooth! And with using the muslin cloth, together it's just great! My only slightly negative opinion, I'd like a little bit more exfoliant within the product itself. Also, this last a good while if you don't overdo it, I have been super happy with it!"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,This is the HOLY GRAIL!,I got this as a sample with one of my purchases. This stuff is AMAZING and I absolutely can see why it’s worth the price. Everytime I use my skin glows for a few days after. It leaves my skin feeling so incredibly soft and youthful. I will absolutely be purchasing this product. Not too crazy about the smell but there’s way too many benefits to this that I barely even notice it. It doesn’t bother me.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Perfection!,"I am an absolute skin care junkie but I never wrote reviews. I got a sample of this cleansing balm and was immediately hooked. I know people complain about the smell, but I actually like it and don’t find it to be that strong. This cleanser has been a total game changer! It leaves my skin so soft and clean- I am completely obsessed! I loved it so much I even went on to buy a few other products from Eve Lol!!"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Canada,"Expensive, but a game changer for me.","Expensive, but it has saved my acne prone skin.  It emulsifies beautifully and although I understand why some may hate the smell, I love it.  It is great at removing makeup with no second wash required.  It is nourishing and a beautiful, beautiful product.  I will continue to dig deep and splurge to help treat/prevent my acne."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,HORRIBLE SMELL,"Smells absolutely horrible and does not emulsify at all! Literally smells like some sort of rotting food I couldn’t even finish washing my face all the way before I rushed to wash it off, which was not quick since this product did not emulsify at all. Way better options out there please look into other cleansing balms or oil based cleansers!"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,That smell :(,"Had high hopes cuz there’s so many good reviews. Got a sample to try on. The smell was unbearable! I agree with another reviewer that it smells like truck :(
Can’t stand the smell I had to stop :("
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,wasn’t for me,i’m glad i got it as a free sample because i wasn’t a fan of it. my face felt greasy & not clean at all. 2 stars because i really liked the cloth & ended up keeping it lol.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,"I got this as a free sample with purchase. I loved the smell (the clove scent is so nice) and texture, plus it removed makeup very well. But it was too drying for my skin."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Loved the ritual,"I got it as a sample with my order. Loved the ritual with massage and the cloth, butter itself is cleansing pretty well. The smell is nice and herbal."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,The smell is ridiculous,"I got a sample of this from a purchase and was excited to use it. I opened the packet and the smell immediately hit me like a truck. It was the first time that a scent has made it hard for me to breathe. I pushed through because I needed to clean my face but was only able to get it halfway on my face before I had to jump in the shower and try to wash the thing off. It may have worked if I could actually keep it on my face, but I will never know."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,"Too thick, too fragrant","This is a VERY thick and lumpy cleanser that melts into an oil as you massage it in. I found it took A LOT of rinsing to get it off, and the strong scent of cloves lingered for quite a while, which I dislike because I’m sensitive to powerful fragrances. I can see using this product if you wear a lot of makeup every day and want a strong cleanser, but it’s not for me. I gave it two stars because I love using the muslin cloth."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Best balm ever for acne prone skin!!,This is my first review for a product I’ve repurchased 3 times already and will continue to do so!! Yes it is a thick consistency like butter but as we know butter melts easily with the warmth so in this case when you rub it or massage it across your face it instantly starts to melt. The smell is not bad at all reminds me of chamomile but it’s very light. I have combination   acne prone skin and this has never clogged my pores! I’ve used so many cleansing balms or oils and they never really were great like this one! The only down part is the price but for what it does I don’t mind at all it usually lasts me about 4 months and I use it every single day. I always double cleanse even when using just sunscreen. I won’t get tired of using this and I HOPE they don’t discontinue this product I will be devastated!!
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Not for me,"Not my type of product, I guess. I'm glad that I got this as a free sample because I was about to purchase the full size without trying it first, and this isn't really for me. I agree with the review that said that using this is like rubbing chunky butter on your face. The texture is very chunky and hard/firm, but once on my face, it didn't really melt for me. I ended up with a few chunks in my hair, around the hairline. I just didn't feel clean at all after using this either. The smell didn't bother me. I just didn't feel clean, didn't felt like it did anything, and the texture bothered me--big chunks everywhere, some of them don't melt until 10 minutes passes by. It's hard to not get it in your hair. There are other cleansing balms for sale that start off chunky but then melt on your face within a minute. I'm just glad that I didn't actually buy this, it wasn't for me at all, and I thought that I would really love it."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Waterproof Makeup remover and moisturizer,"Absolutely loved this cleanser! The thick and fragrant gel like cleanser gently and instantaneously removed the waterproof makeup! My skin felt squeaky clean and surprisingly moisturized. Amazing product overall, highly recommend!"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Free sample so bomb I had to buy it.,Okay kinda mad bc I got this as a free sample and now I’m going to have to buy it. I used my fresh soy face cleanser first and decided to give the Eve Lom a try after. Umm when I tell you I had so much makeup leftover on my face it blew me away. The cloth is great. My face is nice and soft and bright looking. People complain about the smell but it’s not a turn off for me. It just has a natural type smell and it didn’t stick around. I probably wouldn’t use it everyday? But maybe 3 or 4X a week. Definitely worth adding to my skincare mix
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,gross,I received this as a free sample and honestly this has to be the worst cleanser I’ve ever used. It smells HORRIBLE. Immediately made me gag and the smell STAYS on your face even for the 2 seconds it was on my face.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,"SMELL = BAD, TEXTURE = BAD, PRICE = VERY BAD",I got this product as a free sample with a purchase. As soon as I opened the package I was put off by the smell. IT SMELLS BAD. As soon as I put it on my face I wanted it off. This product is super oily in texture. I followed the directions and used the Muslin Cloth that came with (which I LOVE and will keep) and it left my face feeling pretty good. I accidentally got some in my hair though and it feels like I haven’t washed in a week but my face feels soft and clean. Definitely not worth the price point though. I only give two stars because I enjoyed the cloth that came with it.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,Yuck! It felt like I was rubbing chunky butter on my face
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Singapore,delivery is too slow ,Ordered it on last day of member sale. Got it delivered after 3 weeks. Good to have the 20% discount but not competitive towards other site if the delivery is too slow
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,not great,Did the job. Not a fan. It’s too thick and fragrance is not good. I felt as if a must to wash my face with it multiple times.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Great... though not worth the price!,"Great product. Does its job, cleanses the skin and leaves it feeling very comfortable and hydrated, though I have to admit that I didn’t enjoy the texture and fragrance the first time I used it... easy to get used to though. Why 3 stars? The price!! Definetly not worth it with so many more awesome similar cleansers out there that are less than half the price."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Good God it smells horrendous,"Very effective cleansing balm, emulsified beautifully, rinses off without leaving reside, takes off all my makeup and sunscreen. But. 

The smell of this cleanser is so God-awful it makes me gag. I’m surprised so many people like this product with it smelling so vile. It smells like someone tried to create an “all-natural, all-organic” skincare product in their kitchen but now it’s rotting and smells like decay. (I think it might be all the essential oils clashing..?) Just awful, please take my word for it. If you’re looking to buy a cleansing balm from Sephora, use the Clinique or Farmacy one instead. This one literally makes me gag."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Worst smelling product I’ve ever used,"While the texture is nice & really provides a nice deep clean, this is the most awful smelling product I’ve ever used. It smells like fertilizer.. if it smelled better, I’d probably purchase since it cleansed so we’ll."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,This cleanser is expensive but worth it. I love the texture and it melts makeup down so well and leaves my skin feels soft instead of stripped. I do follow w a benzoyl peroxide wash every few days just to clean pores out.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Just ok,"Received this as a sample. It did its job in removing all my makeup fairly easily, but I took off two stars because it stung and irritated my eyes and the smell and texture were rather unpleasant. I wouldn’t personally spend any money on it."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,great but pricey,"I got this as a sample and it made my skin feel divine. Still not sure about spending $80
on 3 oz of cleanser... but an amazing product!"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Elevates your skin care routine!,"Initially, I didn't want to try an $80 cleanser, bc I figured the one I've been using (tatcha deep cleanser) is good. I decided to try this as a part of my spring sale haul and I'm definitely glad I did. This cleanser elevates my skin care routine and it sounds crazy but since I got it, I've been looking forward to washing my face with this and the muslin cloths every night! My skin is left soft, exfoliated, nourished and still left with that clean feeling. I ended up buying the 6 oz. as a back up and one for my mom too!"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,"SO great, but herbaceous","This cleanser is seriously amazing. I love everything about this. It deep cleans, moisturizes, doesn't sting my eyes or leave them cloudy. Now having said that, the scent of this is very herbaceous.  I like earthy smells, but for my wolf smelling abilities, it's almost too intense. I will keep using it because it is awesome. But I wish it smelled better to me."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,luxurious cleansing balm,"I absolutely love this cleanser! The scent can be a hit or miss, I’ll admit. When I first tried it, I was scared that I had purchased an expired one on accident because of the scent but that is just how it smells. It doesn’t linger at all though and really isn’t that bothersome, funnily enough I’ve grown to like it now! But the texture is probably my favorite thing about this product. It’s very thick but melts effortlessly into the skin as it breaks down any makeup or dirt from the day. I actually look forward to taking of my makeup now with this product which is hard to do! It is very expensive though so I will only purchase it if there is any sort of deal on it. I like to put my money into my moisturizers so I do wish it was a bit cheaper. I have not used the Drunk Elephant version but I have tried the Green Clean and Clinique one and I can say I much prefer this product. This is the only cleansing balm where my skin feels clean without a film and I do not experience the urge to put moisturizer on right away after using it! If you have the money and want a luxurious cleanser that doesn’t strip the skin, I’d definitely say to give this a try!"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Super cleanser,"You name it, I’ve tried it. I tried this and loved it. However....the price ouch. Then I ran out. I scoured Sephora for the next face wash that would give me the same results. Well, I’m now back after I couldn’t find anything to give me the same feel and over all clean. I think from the first use, it calmed the slight rosacea on my cheeks.  It does have clove as an ingredient which is pretty bold but dissipates quickly. I happen to live the smell of clove so it was a plus for me. The small jar lasted me 3 months. I will definitely keep this as my face cleanser. I sometimes follow up with tatcha deep cleanser. Then the jet lag mask. I need a TON of hydration because I’m a flight attendant and am always on the dry side. I get compliments on my skin always. I use the Ilia tinted moisturizer with spf 40 as well."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Skin Feels Like BUTTER!,"Oh my this stuff is amazing for when your in high altitudes and your skin gets dry. I used this while I was up in the mountains and my skin was getting sooooo dry that it hurt. As soon as I started to use this as a cleaner, the dryness went away! It saved me and is perfect for the winter or places with low humidity. Feels amazing on your skin as well."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Great product,I just received the product yesterday morning. I love it so far! It smells good and makes my skin feel so fresh and clear! I’m only on day 2 of it!
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Canada,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,Love this cleanser. Started with a mini size and bought the full size after.Removes makeup well and skin doesn’t feel dry afterwards.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Canada,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,"The smell is divine and after using it, my skin is soft and clear. You don't need to wash your face again with another cleanser afterwards."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,"This is the only cleansing balm that I have found that does not burn my sensitive eyes. This is very gentle, a nice thick balm that almost liquefies on contact with the skin. It does emulsify but I use it as recommended with the muslin cloth to wipe it off. If I use just the cleansing balm by itself my skin feels a bit dry afterwards. I always follow up with my Clarisonic and a water-based cleanser afterwards anyways so for me it’s not a problem. I enjoy the smell very much, it smells very natural, herbal, and spa like to me. This does a good job removing my long lasting sunblock. I would recommend this for people who do wear a lot of make up and are looking for a gentle balm cleanser following up with a water-based cleanser afterwards. I would also recommend this to people who don’t wear make up to be used alone as a nourishing facial cleanser. I am extremely acne prone and this has not broken me out or clogged my pores. The most important thing to me about this is that it doesn’t bother my sensitive eyes."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,"try it, you’ll love it (follow the instructions!)","Worth the hype and the cost! I have sensitive, sometimes oily/sometimes acne prone always battling rosacea skin and this stuff is amazing. I pair it with the SK-II lotion or essence and then the Tatcha water cream and my skin is kept at bay from flare ups and angry redness and breakouts for the most part. The muslin is really key too as I was attempting to create a shortcut by skipping that step but honestly it was a waste of my time. The muslin makes this both a regular cleanser and a light exfoliant but not irritating to anyone with sensitive concerns. I find I like the kind of herby/grassy smell, it works when you follow the instructions and create a little mini facial thing there with the pressure points and whatever. Anyway, it works and I stock up during the big sales so I am never without it! The small containers are great for travel as they done leak or anything."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Canada,"Perfect for problematic skin, divine smell","Best makeup removing balm I ever had! 
It is a perfect combination of makeup removing, cleansing, moisturizer, toner, and it could be used with good massage for lifting. 
The steps are a little bit complicated, but once you learn the steps and get used to it(just baby steps, not hard to learn if you try to remember), you will feel lost if you don’t use it daily.
It has a divine and natural smell. The hot-water and cold-water attaining is just so relaxing! 
I had less acne and smoother skin after using this, and I feel really happy after every morning’s routine including it.
It is expensive- it should be."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,,Opinion,"The cleaser makes my skin very clean, even i have heavy make up. i llike this product very much and i will recommend to others. i will purchase it again"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Basic!,"I purchased this off another website but I wanted to leave my review on here. I am rating this harshly based on the price. When I spend money on high end products I expect them to be amazing, not mediocre. Unfortunately, this cleanser is mediocre. It is gentle and feels nice on the skin. I didn’t experience and break outs or negative reactions using this. If you are sensitive to scents or don’t like using skincare products that have a scent, this isn’t for you. My complaint is that it doesn’t remove all my makeup. It doesn’t remove eyeliner or mascara completely and I’ve used other cleansers that do the job. I double cleanse, of course, but I do have high expectations when using cleansing balms. The ingredients in this aren’t luxurious to me and not worth the high price tag. I am in love with the Drunk Elephant cleanser. Those ingredients are better, no scent, removes all my makeup, cheaper, and cruelty free. Eve Lom’s cleanser was a no from me and I don’t think I would try any of their other products in the future."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Canada,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,"i like the smell, and it really helps removing the make up."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Returning - doesn't clean pores.,"This feels like an elegant Vick's vapor rub -  same texture lighter fragrance.  Doesn't clean my pores!  They became clogged with gunk.  Very expensive face ""wash"".  More like washing money out of your wallet.  Will be returning."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,Canada,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,I bought this product back in August and have used this for a week and it broke me out horribly. And until now still recovering from the break outs.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,"Feels luxuries to put it on. The smell is really comforting. I like it better than the Farmacy one, but four-star because it’s pricy."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Worked wonderfully for my oily skin,I have been using this product for several months and I love it. I have oily skin and I haven’t had a major outbreak since I started using it exclusively. This is the clearest my skin has been in my adult life and I’m in my 40s. Would recommend starting with the mini size to see if it works for you but the money spent has been worth it for me.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,I use a lot of makeup and this is a great cleanser to easily remove all of my makeup. I love how the oil base helps my dry skin to stay moisturizer and I get a beautiful glow afterwards! The only down side is the smell that I am not that fond of. But not a dealbreaker either!
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,10/10,"Obsessed with this cleanser! It melts into your skin and dissolves makeup, and lightly exfoliates with the included muslin cloth. Also smells divine. 10\10 recommend."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,This was a good cleansing balm. It did a good job of taking off my makeup and I like that it came with a cleanskng cloth.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Effective cleanser,This Eve Lom Cleanser takes all the makeup and dirt off my effectively. It’s easy to use and gentle on my skin.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,gorgeous cleanser,I love how this products works in taking my makeup off and leaving my skin feel soft. Its very gentle and i highly recommend you guys to try it.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,holy grail cleanser,Holy grail cleanser. This product is awesome. Removes makeup perfectly and leaves the skin feeling super clean and moisturized. Love the herbal smell and it even comes with a cleansing cloth. Highly recommended.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,I've converted to using exclusively balm cleansers to remove my makeup and this is just about the only thing that plows through my face makeup and mascara   eyeliner. The smell doesn't bother me too much and the texture is the perfect blend of solid and creamy and easily melts into my skin when I rub it in with gentle circles. Not sure if I can go back to liquid makeup removers after this!
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,"Really, really impressed","One of the best cleansers I have ever tried, granted this is the only balm cleanser I've tried; I've tried gel, oil, cream cleansers. Oil cleansers are great but there's something really satisfying about being able use this cleanser as a gel and then also a milk cleanser after wetting it with water. It gets off my waterproof mascara and my face feels super clean but not tight or dry after rinsing off. I have oily   sensitive skin but it hasn't exacerbated either of these conditions. 

Really, really impressed with this! Also the muslin cloth that it comes with is a great bonus.

I was able to receive this product for free through Octoly"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Breakout,"When I first received this product I was super excited to try it out after reading all the good reviews. Unfortunately it didn’t work out for me since I have sensitive/ acne prone skin. After a few days of using it I noticed more breakouts than the usual and the only new product I had started using was this cleanser. 
Even though it made my skin breakout I must admit it worked really great after I removed my makeup. 
* I received this complimentary from eve lom for reviewing purposes*"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,This was sort of a first impression for me I hadn't previously tried this brand or used a cream cleanser before so a few firsts came along with this product. I was a little nervous trying this out because I have hypersensitive skin and can very easily have a reaction to a product. The cleanser was super easy to use and left my skin feeling fresh and deep cleaned. I was sent this for testing and review purposes from Octoly.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Amazing product!,For a mineral oil cleanser this is amazing! Feels amazing on the skin and I absolutely love the cloth that comes with it too!
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Great cleanser,"Incrediable formula ! Lightweight, a little goes a long way! Doesn’t clog pores! Cleans deep and takes off hard mascara! Doesn’t burn eyes. Very gentle formula"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Okayyyy,This cleanser was great a first but then it really started drying out my skin!
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,I love the feeling of this cleansing balm -- it's great for using on the skin when doing lymphatic drainage. I also like that it came with a muslin cloth to aid in cleansing. I was disappointed to find it has mineral oil which is why I cannot rate it five stars. I received this product as a free sample.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Worth it,"I had two deeply congested black heads on my nose that I tried to get out over the past few days. They wouldn’t budge. Used this cleanser once and they easily popped right out with little effort. This cleanser really opens and cleans out pores. It even removed my waterproof mascara! I actually look forward to washing my face, it’s relaxing and I know I’m getting a deep clean with this product. A really great cleanser I’ll be repurchasing."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Clean Face and Feeling Refreshed,I really enjoyed using this cleanser. It made my skin feel very clean afterwards. It has a nice scent to it. And I did a test run with a makeup remover wipe afterwards and it did the trick. No left over make up. And a little goes a long way!
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Awesome,A really cool product! It's like bringing the spa to your own home
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Amazing!,Great cleanser! Takes everything off unlike face wipes I have been using!
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Super hydration,Love this cleanser! It helps me a lot and hydrates my tired skin after a long day. I love how soft it feels and you need just a small amount to put on.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,Eve Lom is part of my skincare regimen... it is amazing after use the product my skin looks radiant
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,This product was okaaaay it was not the best or worst. Mixed feelings about this. This product was sent to me as a free sample.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,"Works great, but it broke me out!","I received this product as a free sample. I have oily acne-prone skin. My first impression of this product was that it cleansed my skin beautifully and it got rid of all of my makeup. It left my skin feeling clean and hydrated. But the next day, I broke out everywhere. I believe this product can work great with people who do not have acne-prone skin. I definitely recommend this product if you have dry skin! It’s very hydrating."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,"The Eve Lom Cleanser I wasn’t able to use because the scent was way too overpowering. It smells very herby in my opinion and not in the good way? Although, I tested it on the back of my hand and my hand felt very soft after. However, I do like that it came with a nice muslin cloth!"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Luxurious and unique cleanser,"I think the most important step in skincare is properly removing sunscreen and makeup at the end of the day, so I am definitely very picky about my makeup removal methods. I had tried a couple of balm-type makeup cleansers in the past, but this was the most luxurious and therapeutic cleanser I've used so far. The smell of this is so refreshing and soothes me after a long day of work- it's like nighttime aromatherapy! I was a bit unused to the texture and application of the product at first, and was also excited to try the concept of incorporating a washcloth/muslin steaming step to the process. It seems to be very effective for me, as a little bit of this product removes all my makeup. It leaves my skin feeling very clean but also not taut, but instead treated and primed for my nighttime skincare. This is definitely on the more expensive side of makeup removers, but I believe they are the most important step in most beauty routines, so I think it's a great, luxurious-feeling spend if you want to treat yourself and also do a favor for your skin."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Ok..,"I'm pretty ride or die for my IS Clinical Cleanser, but I thought I'd give this a chance. It's ok. I don't love the mineral oil. For a cleansing balm I prefer the Clinique Take The Day Off..I received this product as a free sample"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Different Yet Amazing,At first I wasn't sure about this cleanser. It had a very earthy smell to it and it tingles slightly on the face. Read and follow the directions because this product works excellent if you do. That very slight tingly feeling I swear gave me a deep clean feeling. My skin felt crazy clean yet moisturized at the same time. The cloth absolutely exfoliates. My skin was smoother and hydrated. At first I wasn't sure and then I fell in love. This product was sent to me complimentary in exchange for my honest review.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,Very sleek packaging. It applied beautifully and left my skin soft and fresh.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,"Nice cleanser, effectively removes makeup just not too crazy about the smell!"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,yuck,I hated this product. It was way too greasy. It made my skin feel even dirtier than before i washed it
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Good and effective cleanser,"For started I need to  just close that I received this product as a free sample, but after using it for about a week, I am actually really enjoying it! It’s a thorough and effective gentle cleanser on my face! I feel a tad bit oily after, but I just slap on a modifying moisturizer and feel great for the rest of the day.  Mind you, my face is naturally very oily."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Amazing cleanser great for combo skin,I received this product as a free sample. I really like how it makes my skin feel tingly and removes all traces of makeup. My skin feels refreshed and soft and So clean after using it. It also is very moisturizing which I love for a cleanser because I'm getting older and my skin lacks natural moisture.
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,love!,"I have had this cleanser for a couple weeks now, and I love it! It explains how to use the cleanser in order to get the most out of it, and also comes with a muslin cloth. I feel like I'm at a spa every time I use it!"
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Cleanser - 100ml,"This makes for a luxury cleansing experience- leaves my face super soft and rinses very clean. I just wasn’t a big fan of the scent. I have so many other favorite balms that do the trick with a lesser cost. This is a treat when I use it, just not sure if I’d repurchase. I received this product complimentary for review purposes."
EVE LOM-Cleanser,USA,Just ok,Not usually a fan of cleansing balms. Does the job but definitely other products out there that are better for the price.
ALPHA-H-Melting Moment Cleansing Balm with Wild Orange Leaf Extract,Australia,Beautiful cleansing balm ,"This balm is delightful to use. It feels lovely on, as it melts over your skin into a soft emulsion. Foundation, primer and sunscreen dissolve away.
However it's quite pricey and I found coconut oil does a better job of removing eye makeup."
ALPHA-H-Melting Moment Cleansing Balm with Wild Orange Leaf Extract,Australia,perfect double cleanse,"Love this product,its so soft on my skin and removed all my days makeup and spf.. added suprise that you can use as a hydrating mask on clean skin, just leave on for 10 min for soft hydrating skin, I will definitely be doing that."
ALPHA-H-Melting Moment Cleansing Balm with Wild Orange Leaf Extract,Australia,So Devine!,"One of my most favourite products! The smell is Devine, the texture is beautiful and it’s very nourishing without leaving an oily residue. I’ve bought one as a gift for mum, who also is in love with it"
ALPHA-H-Melting Moment Cleansing Balm with Wild Orange Leaf Extract,Australia,best cleansing balm,This takes my makeup of so easily and leaves my skin feeling so soft! A little goes a long way and it took off my mascara so easily. I didn’t even need to double cleanse because it took off everything.
ALPHA-H-Melting Moment Cleansing Balm with Wild Orange Leaf Extract,Australia,it’s alright! ,This is alright for a one time purchase. Does what it says. It’s very creamy and has a nice scent too. But I find my skin a big greasy using it. Wouldn’t buy it again. I prefer their cleanser though! Just think this one isn’t a necessity as such! 
ALPHA-H-Melting Moment Cleansing Balm with Wild Orange Leaf Extract,Australia,good for others ,"I only gave this product 3 stars because I’m already an oily girlie, so it always felt like there was something STILL leftover on my skin, however I think dry skinned girlies would LOVE it, it’s a really thick luxe product. So now I’ve just used it as a make up remover only when I go full glam, and it takes it all off, so quickly and easily. I would also not leave it in the bathroom if you have lots of steamy showers, the balm melts when it’s near the end. "
ALPHA-H-Melting Moment Cleansing Balm with Wild Orange Leaf Extract,Australia,cleansing balm that’s is not oily! ,I have tried a few cleansing balms over the years but this is by far the best. Melts makeup/spf off the skin and leaves skin feeling moisturised and supple after. I do tend to use this as the first part of a double cleanse as I like that super clean feel but would be ok on its own if followed by a warm face washer (I tend to use it before I get in the shower). Love the sweet and somehow at the same time fresh orange scent. Feel super luxe! 
ALPHA-H-Melting Moment Cleansing Balm with Wild Orange Leaf Extract,Australia,Amazing! Amazing! ,This is the best! Totally worth it! Took my makeup off within minutes and my skin felt amazing afterwards. 
ALPHA-H-Melting Moment Cleansing Balm with Wild Orange Leaf Extract,Australia,magic,"Love this face cleanser, so easy, rub all over your face, and rinse off with warm water, I do it in the shower, removes all my makeup including eye makeup, leaving my face feeling really cleansed and fresh"
ALPHA-H-Melting Moment Cleansing Balm with Wild Orange Leaf Extract,Australia,Amazing balm!,"Can't fault this product. It smells amazing, it cleans your face so well and makes your skin so smooth. Glad I found a new Alpha-H fave. You don't need much and it's best if you put it on just before you shower remove with warm water. I hope it comes in smaller travel size soon!"
TALIKA-Skintelligence Hydra - Moisturising Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,Great cleanser,"This is definitely a great cleanser. The foam is perfectly in a dense texture, just 1 pump is enough to clean you face, and it has a very pleasant floral smell, which let you enjoy face wash timing. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for cleanser, no matter you are dry or oily. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing & Soothing Micellar Gel,Australia,amazing ,i love the cleansing and soothing micellar gel because it is easy to apply and does not cause break outs when i take off my makeup! it feels amazing on my skin and i definitely recommend! 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing & Soothing Micellar Gel,Singapore,love this,writing a review for my friend who used this product for few years. good for oily skin and doesn’t leave a layer of oil or discomfort on skin after removing makeup! she loves it so much!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing & Soothing Micellar Gel,Singapore,Cleans well,The gel removes my makeup pretty well but I do not like the gel texture. It will be perfect if it is between the texture of gel and water in order to apply and removes makeup more easily 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Cleansing & Soothing Micellar Gel,Singapore,👍🏻 product,Unscented. Good for oily combo skin I think. Works well on me! But Waterproof mascara might take some time to remove it. Other than that it’s does it’s job! 
SKIN INC-Pure Serum Infused O2 Cleanser,Malaysia,Interesting! ,Love the texture. It will change to bubbles when you leave it on your skin. The bubbles give mild tingling sensation but I love it so much. Very interesting product! Suitable if you are searching for a deep cleanse and unique product. 
SKIN INC-Pure Serum Infused O2 Cleanser,Singapore,Love it !,"I enjoy using the cleanser when my face needs a good clean. Skin feels hydrated and soft after wash. Downside, I feel there is not much product in the tube so I use this sparingly. This is my second purchase coz I love the effect it has on my skin "
SKIN INC-Pure Serum Infused O2 Cleanser,Singapore,My new OBSESSION ,"This product has changed my skin. I was a little sceptical at first but I can instantly feel the difference after. This also makes cleansing so fun because of how it bubbles up, will definitely buy again. "
SKIN INC-Pure Serum Infused O2 Cleanser,Singapore,awesome double cleansing,"this cleanser is great! i am super obsessed with the 2-in-1 cleansing abilities. it’s just sooo easy to use. i literally save money and time cause i don’t have to remove my makeup with a cleansing oil/balm and then cleanse it one more time again. after using this for 2 weeks, i don’t think i can ever go back to actual double cleansing, i’m too used to this!!🤭"
MARIO BADESCU-Gentle Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,Mario Badescu,Soft and good for sensitive skin. Feels refreshed after every wash. Doesn’t peel skin. Love the product. Bought it at a steal from Sephora. Worth trying if you have sensitive skin prone to breakout. Cheap and does its work!
MARIO BADESCU-Gentle Foaming Cleanser,USA,Seeing a difference,"I recently started using this foaming cleanser and so far,  I am seeing a difference.  My skin feels refreshed, clean and soft.  Works great to remove makeup and there’s no smell either."
MARIO BADESCU-Gentle Foaming Cleanser,USA,Mario Badescu Gentle Foaming Cleanser,"This cleanser left my skin clean and soft; however, it caused me to break out, I decided to discontinue."
MARIO BADESCU-Gentle Foaming Cleanser,USA,Best makeup remover!!!,I use this before my enzyme cleansing gel and it gets all my makeup off!! It leaves me face feeling refreshed and soft and creates a beautiful lather that’s easy to rinse off. You definitely need to add this to your routine!
ALPHA-H-Everyday Fresh Cotton Cloths,New Zealand,Washes well,I have found with face cloths they absorb the foundation colour and its so hard to get out. With these cloths almost all the colour is rinsed out after using. Not the softest cloths but does the job. Very cute packaging!
ALPHA-H-Everyday Fresh Cotton Cloths,Philippines,Nice Face Towels,It's breathable cotton fabric makes it so gentle to use for drying the skin after cleansing. I love that its white so any stain from makeup can be easily removed
ALPHA-H-Everyday Fresh Cotton Cloths,Australia,Light cleansing ,"I’d been wanting to get into cleansing cloths so chose these as they seemed like good value. They do the job, but now I know they are inferior to other cloths available. These are very light and remind me of handkerchief material! I use them to wipe off a masque instead of washing the masque off. The material is very thin and far from luxurious but it’s fine for my routine. If used with coloured products (eg a green masque) the colour does not seem to wash out completely so the cloth will look tired pretty quickly. Having 7 to cycle through is handy though. "
ALPHA-H-Everyday Fresh Cotton Cloths,Australia,Highly recommended ,"I use these for all types of things & there’s nothing quite like them. We use them for the family member w acne ( who doesn’t need the cross infection issues from other family members)these hand wash rapidly & dry quickly, preferably outside, they’re good for use in a first aid kit ( wounds invariably need cleaning & these are ideal)& to keep on hand for guests, they make a nice “ gift”type thing.....& for them to take with them when they leave ~ these are just a couple of uses we have. Highly recommended item!!!"
ALPHA-H-Everyday Fresh Cotton Cloths,Australia,gentle and soft,These are not exfoliating but they aren’t really nice and gentle face cloths that hold up well over time for daily face washing. I would definitely buy them again 
ALPHA-H-Everyday Fresh Cotton Cloths,Singapore,Great to have,I love it and i repurchased during the 25% sale. I will either use it to dry up my face after my facial routine or use it to wipe off mask. I soak them with warm water in a basin and then hand wash them. Will repurchased again at the next sale. 
ALPHA-H-Everyday Fresh Cotton Cloths,Australia,Average,"I think the price point is good for 7 cloths, but the quality of the cloths is lacking. They feel very scratchy and more like bed sheet material. I'll keep using them, because I don't like the waste, but I will not repurchase. "
ALPHA-H-Everyday Fresh Cotton Cloths,New Zealand,do not recommend ,"Compared to other brands I have tried the cloths are not as soft as I was expecting for the $$$. I also found they stain easy, when other cloths wash out"
ALPHA-H-Everyday Fresh Cotton Cloths,New Zealand,Expensive but Useful,I was on the market looking for a really good quality cloth to go with my skincare routine and I came across this. I like it how it is in a 7 pack so I could wash it regularly but it is a bit expensive for what you get. You have to be gentle while using this because it may irritate the skin since it is a bit rough. Otherwise it dries out fast which is a good thing
ALPHA-H-Everyday Fresh Cotton Cloths,,ok,"These cloths are nice and soft, light weight, and can be used plenty of times. They handle the washing machine really well. I think the amount of cloths you get in the pack is really great for Alpha H (I actually think there is too many - but that seems like a strange thing to complain about). The advantage of this, is that you always have a clean one ready to go. "
ALPHA-H-Everyday Fresh Cotton Cloths,,There okay ....,i bought them to start my new skin care but to be honest i used them for 1 week and not using them anymore they arent the best they are not as soft as i expected and they actually hurt my face when i rub the treatments off i now use cotton wipes 
PIXI-Double Cleanse,Malaysia,good for double cleansing,Cleanse of make up fast and gently better than using facial wipes. The balm side is gentle on skin to thoroughly clean away makeup and the cream side further cleans the face gently and smoothly without stripping skin.
PIXI-Double Cleanse,Singapore,Useful for makeup and cleansing,This is now my fourth time buying this cleanser! It’s amazing to cleanse your face when you have makeup on and it doesn’t leave your face stripped of hydration like most facial cleansers can feel. I use this every night to clean my face! 
PIXI-Double Cleanse,Singapore,not so sure,"It might be cleaned and I just not use to it. as facial-wash user, I was feeling not so cleaned as facial cleanser or foam. I am not sure whether facial cleanser to be used before. A wet towel has to be used for wriping as well."
PIXI-Double Cleanse,Singapore,It works but cleansing lotion is unnecessary,"I like the balm but I don’t think the cleansing lotion is necessary especially if you’re jumping in the shower and washing your face with a liquid cleanser anyway.

Price point is okay but I wish they just gave more of the balm instead."
PIXI-Double Cleanse,Malaysia,love this! ,"My skin visibly improved after using this cleansing duo. The balm is great for breaking down heavy base make up, mascara and eyeshadow. The cream cleanser side is nice to use - the best cream cleanser I’ve used. Wish the cream cleanser came separately cuz I ended up going through that faster than the balm. "
PIXI-Double Cleanse,Australia,Good,"Works really well, the balm takes off all my makeup. The other side is a bit watery and I don’t see much difference after using it but it definitely makes my face feel more clean"
PIXI-Double Cleanse,Singapore,poor packagaing,"didn't like the packaging because everytime I dip my fingers into the pot, a bit of water goes in. I have sensitive oily skin. my face doesn't feel cleansed, neither does it feel squeeky clean after using it. wont repurchase"
PIXI-Double Cleanse,Singapore,Nope,Not a fan. I tend to have oily/combination skin and this left my skin oilier. I also found that I had to use more product to remove my makeup.. I almost never managed to remove all my mascara. Much prefer Farmacy's cleansing balm and Fresh's cleansing oil. 
PIXI-Double Cleanse,,Double Cleanse Default,"Perfect for travelling, 2 in one double cleanse. it removes makeup very well as well..                                                                                       "
PIXI-Double Cleanse,,great product,"This is a great product for travelling and especially if your method of cleansing is “apply on dry skin and wipe of with damp cloth”. I’m more of a rinse off with water type of person but I cannot fault the usability of this cleanser. My skin feels clean without the dry, tight feeling at all. The balm melts off makeup brilliantly, and following with the cream cleanser gives the assurance that your skin is well cleansed of the days gunk!"
PIXI-Double Cleanse,,Great concept & product,"I love the idea of having 2 cleansers in one tub but it’s a bit messy to use. Don’t like dipping my fingers into the product. Sometimes I have to dip in twice coz I took too little the first time and that’s not hygienic. I also have to dry my fingers frm rinsing the balm first, before dipping into the cream cleanser. But I’m giving 4 stars coz I love love love the cleansing balm. Doesn’t sting my eyes and really does a great job at removing waterproof makeup. Great job Pixi! It would be great if you could come up with a more user friendly packaging. "
PIXI-Double Cleanse,,ok product ,"I like the Idea of having double cleanse in one package, but it is a bit bulky and heavy for traveling so will not repurchase. Cleansers in themselves were good"
PIXI-Double Cleanse,,okay,It's an okay cleansing balm and cream. The cleansing balm works really well to take off even waterproof make up. The cleansing cream is just OK though. Its a bit too mild for my taste. 
PIXI-Double Cleanse,,Good,I really love the cleansing balm. It really does removes my makeup especially if you're wearing waterproof mascara or matte lipstick that does not remove by only miracellar water. I recommended this for everyone! Will repurchased it soon. 
PIXI-Double Cleanse,,Best simple cleanser,"This is a cleanser that I always repurchase. It does its job, and it’s great for sensitive skin. It takes all of your makeup off in a non-drying way. There is no smell and it’s super pleasant to use. Definitely 5 stars!"
PIXI-Double Cleanse,,2 in 1!,I like that it has two in one kind of concept so I don’t need to bring extra cleanser just to double cleanse after makeup removal. Skin feels soft and moisturised after washing 
PIXI-Double Cleanse,,palm size cleanser,"The oil part is like balm and the cleanser is very mild. Suitable for sensitive skin and normal to dry skin but not oily skin
It doesnt foams up..
I dont feel very clean feeling after each usage and it make my face oily instead.
I dont think i will repurchase this again."
PIXI-Double Cleanse,,Great product ,Convenient to use on a daily basis. The solid oil cleanser thoroughly cleans off my makeup and it’s easy to rinse using a small face cloth and warm water. The cream cleanser is gentle and it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I also like that the product is not scented but it doesn’t have any unpleasant smell. 
PIXI-Double Cleanse,,5 star for the cream cleanser!,"The cleansing oil comes in a solid form which is pretty meh as i feel that it is rather troublesome to have to dig my finger into the product and then massage my entire face with it. However, the cream cleanser is the absolute bomb! Face feels so smooth and clean after washing it all away, if they were to sell the cream cleanser individually, i would definitely buy it!"
PIXI-Double Cleanse,,Must have recommeded,"The cream cleanser is so lush.  I am a long time user of foaming cleanser and this has changed me.  The solid oil makeup remover is alright as there are many to choose from in the market.  If they make the cream cleanser in tub, I'll repurchase. "
PIXI-Double Cleanse,,so far so good.,"Caroline Hirons is the queen of skincare, and this definitely did not disappoint. Was so excited to finally try this after it was available in SG. Removes makeup like a dream, and I just need to gently wipe away everything with a damp cloth. "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,Singapore,cleansing foam,This is good! I am pretty satisfied and amazed by how it cleanses and does not leave my skin feeling dry after washing. I do recommend to dry-dehydrated skin type (which is me!) to try. 
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,Singapore,easy to use,Always love pump foam cleanser. Easy to use and oh so fine to reach into your pores. Im a skin Inc fan! Cleanses without drying. Will definitely repurchase
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,Singapore,SUX,I have yet to try this product but i was quite apalled to see that its not even filled fully!! its mad ex and like i feel quite cheated. Thankful i bought this on sale tho 
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,Malaysia,Best facial foam cleanser ever,"This is my first Skin Inc product and I do not regret trying it at all! Purchased during the 30% off promo and now it has become my favourite face cleanser. It does cleanse my face really well, will continue to use it and definitely gonna repurchase it!"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,Singapore,Gentle cleanser,"Feels gentle on the skin and a small pump is enough to wash the face each time. After washing, it makes the skin feels deliciously supple! Generally a good cleanser to try :) "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,Australia,drying,"If you have dry dehydrated skin, avoid this as it’s only gonna make your skin even more dehydrated. Foam cleanser tend to be harsh on any skin type too so not recommending this product"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,suitable for sensitive / acne prone skin ,"Didn’t regret switching over as it helps to keep my skin hydrated, less oily and lesser outbreaks. Suitable for people with sensitive or acne prone skin too. "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Cleaning Ok,"I personally like this cleanser because i like to alternate my cleanser between foam and liquid. This cleanser leaves your skin moisturised and not dry like most of strong cleanser. However, it doesn't fully clean my face as I still can pick up some residual make ups after I've applied toner. Hence, i am only using this cleanser early in the morning when I am make up free. I drop 1 star due to it doesnt clean thoroughly and another star for its expensive price. "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Average cleanser,"I'm a big fan of skin inc's products, sadly this was a miss for me especially because it was so expensive. It doesn't leave my skin feeling all that clean or dewy."
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,The best facial foam i have tried.,My skin felt super fresh after using it.. Loving it!! Not gonna stop buying.. For the price point quite reasonable to be compare to other high end brands.
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,face wash ,"Nothing great . Just like a normal face wash . See no difference to the skin . I have oily skin , it helps slightly after using this . Other wise just like a regular face wash . I Won’t repurchase it "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Gentle and effective,My go to cleansing foam! Been using this since I first tried it and have gone through quite a few bottles. It is very gentle and works well on sensitive skin. It cleanses my face really well too. Only downside is its price. 
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Good for me,My skin is sensitive and oily so there are some products that I cannot use. I like that the foam is light and airy but still cleans my skin well. I only wish that it comes in a big bottle so it does not run out so quickly.
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Nice,This cleansing form is gentle and lightweight. My face feels soft after washing. It is best used after removing the makeup as it does not remove the makeup stain. I've been using this more than a month and I could use it for morning and night cleanser.
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,USA,Drying,It kinda dried out my 57 year old skin. I use moisture. Lots of herbal oils and good foundation. This just is too drying for older skin. Feels like my pores are larger. It's just not for me in this Ohio winter weather.
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Best cleanser,I am in my 4th bottle. Love the texture and it is a good cleanser especially for those sensitive skin. It is a little bit pricey but Skin inc product is definitely good. I have tried others but always come back to this. Will continue use it. ❤️❤️❤️
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Best Cleansing Foam EVER,"I swear by Skin Inc products ever since I started using them about 3 years ago. This cleanser is gentle on skin yet by just using one pump, it thoroughly cleanses my oily skin. I even recommend it to my fiancè who has been using this for 3 years and he mentioned that other men facial products are too harsh and does not work effectively like Skin Inc does. 101% recommend to all women and men out there!"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,daily routine product,"Gentle on my sensitive skin yet non-drying, i've been using this cleansing foam everyday for the past 2 years. This product has kept my acne at bay. Pair this with the skin inc serums for sustainable good skin. "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,LOVE IT,"I have been using this cleanser for a long time. I try others as well but always come back to this. It keeps my face feeling fresh and clean after washing, and most importantly doesnt dry out my skin."
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,SkinCare,"I've used this for 2 years and it leaves the skin incredibly clean. However as my skin is very sensitive, I find it's almost too squeaky clean which makes it harder to put moisture back into it. I think it'd be suitable for skin types which are slightly oily."
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Really Good!,"I give this 5 stars (more if there was more stars). Out with the old, in with the new. Skin is visibly brighter after usage. After cleansing, use this to ""peel off the old skin"". Follow up with the next step of the serum and overnight mask. You will wake up with a different feeling. Still waiting to see if scars will lighten or not. Praying that this would help!"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,USA,Nice basic cleanser,"This is a very good foaming cleanser that feels somewhat creamy but light at the same time. I have sensitive skin and like that this is fragrance free and doesn't contain any irritating ingredients. It's great for using in the morning or following make up removal. I was willing to try it out because I'm always searching for a great cleanser that's not irritating or too drying, but I do think the price is high for a basic cleanser that is only 3.4 oz. On the the other hand, it is a nice size for travel."
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,USA,Concentrated and conditioning!,"I love that it only takes one pump of this cleanser to take off makeup and cleanse my skin. It is super concentrtated, and the foam feels luxurious and creamy. I have used it with just my hands and also with my Clarisonic and with my Foreo Luna Mini--great results every time. It always gets the grime from the city off my face, as well as all traces of makeup (I use a separate eye makeup remover)

It makes your skin super clean but soft. You don't feel all dried out like your skin has been stripped. It gives you some hydration, and that makes your other skincare go on better, in my opinion. I love that there isn't some overpowering scent, also . Really great cleanser that also brightens. Two thumbs way up!"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,USA,Love!,"I love this cleanser.  The foam is very lightweight but still makes my skin feel very clean and refreshed.  I have dry combination skin, and it doesn't feel like it's stripping my skin.  I use a makeup remover wipe before since this cleanser does not remove eye makeup."
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,USA,Yes & No,"Figured that since this product doesn't have many ratings, I'd give my opinion about it.
My skin is sensitive to scented products and so it was a relief when I found out that this product doesn't have a scent. I really do like the product and so those who are struggling to find a product that works, I would give this product a try. The reason that I deducted a star is due to the value of the product. I finished the product a lot faster than any other cleanser I've used before.. and this product is not considered cheaper. I'm still debating if I want to keep purchasing it since it does treat my skin well. I hope that SkinInc comes out with other cleansers where it lasts longer and works just as efficient!"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,USA,Skin Inc Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,I have very sensitive skin and this product line has transformed my skin. It cleanses nicely doesn't feel like it dries my skin out . Has cleared my skin up completely !
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,USA,Nice product,So far so good. It is very foamy. Very gentle too.
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,USA,Perfect for Brightening and Cleansing Skin,"I can't say enough good things about about Skin Inc.'s products. I use the entire skin care line and I am so impressed at how soft and bright my skin is. I have sensitive skin and the cleansing foam is not too harsh but it is effective. These products have made a huge difference in the appearance of my skin, and my confidence as well. My skin is more youthful and I love how it feels. My complexion has looked so nice that I haven't even had to wear foundation. I highly recommend this Cleansing Foam and these products from Skin Inc!"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Good,"Foam texture is gentle on skin, the best type of facial wash. I have sensitive skin and this product felt so clean without causing discomfort. It removes light make up with just half pump of foam, My skin feels soft and smooth and most importantly it doesnt leave my skin dry."
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,USA,The best cleasner,"I read some reviews about how awesome this cleanser it, so I decided to give it a try. It cleans dirty on my face without drying. I have really really sensitive skin, this cleanser neither break me out nor give me red spot."
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Pure Gold,"If you have sensitive skin, this is for you. There are many cleansers in the market, but none works as well as this. Comes in a handy palm size bottle, you can use it at home or take it with you when you travel. Easy application and fuss free. Just 1 pump and it leaves your face cleansed, hydrated and fresh! Will be back for more!"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Gentle and highly effective,"Use it daily and it is gentle to skin, without being drying at all. A cleansing foam that cleanses thoroughly, yet hydrates and brightens at the same. Such an amazing product, especially for oily and acne-prone skin. "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,SKIN INC Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,"Bought 2 cleansers together when luxola was having a sale earlier. As I am still using the other cleanser, I have not get to try out this product yet. Thus I am leaving a 3 star review first and would update later after I have used it. "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Good surprise!,"Used a few other foam bubbly cleansers but never did like them enough as I always feel my skin isn't cleansed properly - but this product completely changed my mind! Makes my skin feels thoroughly cleansed without the dryness, perfect for my sensitive skin. Compatible to use with the Clarisonic as well. Love it!"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,My favourite Cleanser,"I bought this cleanser by mistake, and i thought ""hey, no harm trying!"". i was using shu uemura cleansing oil but it can get costly overtime, and i would find alternatives to use . This cleanser by far has been the best cleanser I've used in comparison to all the other cleansers i've tried. 
I have sensitive skin, and besides shu uemura (which doesn't break me out or cause irritation), this is the best.
Try it! you will enjoy it. "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Skin Inc cleansing foam,"This cleansing foam is one of my favorite! After applying it on wet skin, it creates even more foam while you gently massage it on your face!  It leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated! Love the texture of it and how it cleanses my skin!"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,good cleanser!,"Bought this after reading through positive reviews, it does leave your skin feeling very clean and hydrated! however it is pretty pricey and i personally feel that it is only worth it at a discounted price!"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Gentle Cleanser,"This is good for people who likes gentle cleanser. I usually prefers a richer foamy one to use with my clarisonic at night. I quite like to use it in the morning though, but the price is a little on the high side for a small bottle."
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Foamy cleanser,"Had just tried this cleanser one time while i'm showering earlier. Seems like a normal foaming cleanser to me.. No strong smell, normal foaming power, skin doesn't feel tight after using. But the price is a little steep for me to maintain. So i will just probably get a cheaper one. "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Gentle and fragrance free ,"Have been using this cleanser for close to a month and it suits my sensitive skin. Even though the price is on the higher side, I think it should last me for 4-5 months as my face is quite small. I only use 3/4 of a pump in the morning, and 1 pump at night as a makeup remover / cleanser. Will definitely repurchase after finishing it."
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Not recommended,"Product does not bring visible improvement to skin and its foaming texture leaves skin with a curious sensation that it is uncleaned. After washing, skin also slightly greasy. Given its price, more is expected of its prowess."
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Fave Cleanser,"This is my favourite cleanser as of date! Have been using it for a year plus. Having sensitive skin, I'm very concerned as to whether products will invoke allergies on my skin. This facial wash does not. However, it can be a lil bit drying, so make sure to apply moisturizer thereafter. Will usually purchase this when there is a sale as skin inc products are really expensive."
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,"The foam feels soft and doesn't dry out my face after washing, that is it didn't have the squeaky clean feeling. It also doesn't cause discomfort to my sensitive skin. Fantastic item when bought during sale."
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Very good foam cleanser,Excellent cleanser. Usually a foam cleanser will leave your skin dry and tight but I find this does the opposite. It's a very gentle cleanser giving  you a soft and smooth aftermath. Will continue repurchasing this product.
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,By far the Best!,This is by far the best cleanser I have ever used. I have combination skin. Love using this with my Foreo Luna. It does not dry my skin out and always leaving my skin feeling baby bum smooth. Cannot wait to repurchase as I am nearly running out!
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,One of my favourite cleansers!,"This foam product was excellent from the packaging to the quality and effect it left on my skin. I like the foamy texture of the product, it was light to the touch and left a cleansed skin after washing without the skin feeling too taut. Overall, it was a great product!"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,This is good! ,A very good product that doesn't dry your skin after washing. It feel like the skin had been moisturize. The foam prevent me from using too much pressure on my skin which is a plus point. I feel my skin are less stressed. 
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Good!,"I love foam cleanser! It doesn't dries my skin out after cleansing and it is better than my clinic doctor cleanser. After washing, face is immediately brightened and feels soft. I guess this is by far the best cleanser i have come across! Will be back to purchase."
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Great products,This is the N times buying after a long wait for the products to be replenished. Good product great price best service. Nothing to be fussy about. Aldy recommend many people to buy.. a complete convert now. 
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Love this cleanser!,I like this cleanser very much. It foams well & cleans well. It smells very refreshing too - not heavily scented. It does leave my skin feeling a little dry after each wash so I always apply a light lotion. I only wish there was more product for this price! This bottle lasted me less than 2 months.  
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Awesome,"My skin feels clean but not tight after using this cleanser, unlike some products out there. 1 pump is sufficient, it works up a foamy lather and is very comfortable on the skin. Works great with a facial brush too for deeper cleansing. Recommended!"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Skin Inc foam cleanser,"This is a very gentle cleanser, should be suitable for sensitive skin. I especially like how it does not have any fragrances, unlike many other cleansers out there which always have fragrances as an ingredient and you never really know what is in there. It also seems to be able to remove most of my makeup. However, it does not seem to help with preventing/ healing breakouts that come with my monthly cycles."
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Best cleanser 😍,I've tried many cleansers that claimed it's hydrating and is suitable for sensitive skin but nothing works for me. I've finally found the one .... It not not only deeply cleanses your face but it does not leave u feeling tight but just right. Your skin would look brighter and it glows! Definitely following up with their onsen mist and customized serum! There you're on your way to awesome skin!
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Gentle on the skin,It's soft and gentle! I always believe in deep cleansing with foam cleanser. I use it in the morning and after my make up removal in the night. It helps to cleanse my face better and my skin feels softer after use. One thing that I did not really like is that there's a slight smell which I don't really fancy.  
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,My favourite night-time essential cleanser now!,Love the clean feeling but yet not drying feeling after using this cleanser. It leaves the skin clean and instantly fairer and brighter too. I use this as the cleanser in the night after i remove all my makeup. Definitely will recommend this product!  
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Fragrance free ,"I've been searching for the perfect cleanser since forever and none ever truly satisfy me. Decided to try out this cleansing foam from skin inc after reading much highly rated reviews. Fragrance free, great in removing light makeup, not that sure about heavy makeup as i haven't tried. Leaves skin oil free and fresh after use. I must say this is one of the best in the market which i've tried. Will finish this bottle and see the results before deciding if this is the perfect cleanser i've been looking for."
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,holygrail,gon' add this into my holygrail list really love this item! always thought that foam cleansers weren't good for the skin but decided to try since its Skin Inc. foamy and easy to squeeze bottle. not sure if this would last me at least 3 months. i use this with my clarisonic aft a long day. cleans like magic!!! love their serums as well <3
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Great prodcut,"I use this with my foreo and its a great cleanser that does its job well. My skin is soft after using it and it does not feel tight at all. Love this more than the Ren one, and one bottle lasts for a few months. Half a star deducted because of the price. "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Worth Trying,"Firstly, i have an undeniable love for anything foamy. I decided to purchase the prodew cleansing foam as i read that it works well with the Skinc Trinity Cleansing oil which i already own. All you need it just one pump of foam, and lather it onto damp face. Really couldn't get over the foamy texture on my face! I paid lesser then the original price, all thanks to the heap load of discounts from luxola, but, i am pretty sure this bottle will only last for a maximum of 3 weeks or so. On the end note, definitely am repurchasing it again. "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Best cleanser,"I have a very very very dry skin and this cleanser has very very very good moisturizing effect without leaving my skin feels dry and tight. I've tried a few cleansers, and none of it is able to beat this. The best thing is, this bottle can last you for 3 months. "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Not for me,I have sensitive combination skin and I thought I should grab this product with the raving reviews. Definitely not the product for me. My face started secreting more sebum. I think it's more for people who want to have a basic wash after removing make up. Not for people who just want to wash one time and be done with it for the whole day.
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Love it,First time trying Skin Inc washing foam. Very good not drying leave the skin soft. Definitely good buy. Love the foam and the smell. Not a very big bottle. Will wait for sale to pick up another one as this one won't last very long
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Gentle cleansing action,"My 2nd bottle, cleanses but doesn't dry or feel tout after cleansing. Feels that it clean thoroughly too. Slight pricy but worth the buy. 1 pump is sufficient to wash whole face and neck. Foam is dense and easy to apply. works well with my clarisonic. "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Favourite cleanser so far!,Have been using this for almost two weeks now. My skin is sensitive and I love how this cleanser does not leave my face feeling dry after cleansing unlike the products I've used in the past.Will definitely recommend this to everyone.
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Worth the purchase ,"Got it because there was a sale going on site. Pretty nice feeling after cleansing. It doesn't dry up your skin comparing to other brands. Only one bad side, It's pretty hard to remove the eyes make up so you still have to use either a water base or tissue cleanser to remove your eyes make up entirely. "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Pure Pro Dew,I no longer need to look at any other products or brands anymore !! An excellent product. Makes my skin smoothen out & irons out the fine lines. I am going to buy the whole range of skin inc products!! A forever lasting BIG fan of SKin Inc serums!!! Great for daily multiple use without drying your skin
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Ms,4th bottle so far! Very easy to use and cleanses well without over drying my face. Recommended my mum the product too and she loves it as well.. It cleans of the residue of my makeup well. Very good buy during sale
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Works wonders!,"Foam texture is gentle on skin, the best type of facial wash. I have sensitive skin and this product felt so clean without causing discomfort. It removes light make up with just half pump of foam, my bb cushion, blusher cushion and loose powder came off totally. I used a cotton pad with make up remover to check if any make up remained but no, not even a tinge! Fantastic item at this price!"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Good product,"This is my day and night cleanser! its very gentle! It does seems to minimize my pores. With just a gentle pump it's sufficient, can drip few droplets of water to make it more foamy. Not drying, feel fresh after each wash"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Soft foamy clear skin!,"Skininc has been my regular skincare brand for my sensitive skin. Cleanser is of a foam formula, and I love it! It cleans up makeup as well, but not waterproof mascara and eyeliner that well. It leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean and soft! However it's a little pricey for a cleanser, thus well recommended to try if at discounted cost."
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Great cleanser,"Skinc never disappoints. I was having some hormonal issues and skin has massive breakouts - I had to change my whole skincare regime to Skinc and after 1 night of use, I find that my skin and angry zits have calmed down alot.

This cleanser can clean face thoroughly but it doesn't leave a 'squeaky' clean feel, so you don't feel it's drying at all. "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,try it!!,"I have a prone acne skin type and this foam cleanser just saves my life! so to speak. it brightens my skin, helps to clear up zits, even minimize my pores. it doesn't irritate my skin after usage and i feel so fresh after every use. LOVE this and thanks for introducing this great skincare into Luxola! "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,gentle clean foamy!,"its my day and night cleanser! its very gentle! 
(i would like to highlight that i'm using it together with foreo luna, hence i'll be washing my face to at least 1 minute). my skin feels soft and smooth and most importantly it doesnt leave my skin dry. its a little pricy but totally worth the 1-minute foam fun"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Awesome,Used to be sceptical about foam cleansing as I have tried several products and ended up my skin feeling kinda dry after washing. Skin Inc facial foam leaves my sensitive skin gentle and the after effect is smoothing and cool!
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,skin inc cleansing foam,the foam is evenly spread out and it feels very clean after cleaning. the foam is evenly spread out and it feels very clean after cleaning. the foam is evenly spread out and it feels very clean after cleaning. i have used for 6 months now.. sometimes it can be quite drying
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Gentle Facial Cleanser,"I  have got really sensitive skin and most facial products usually are too harsh for my face. This cleanser is really gentle, and does not dry out my face. One pump is more than enough for a good wash!"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Gentle and moisturizing cleanser ,"I saw many blogger reviews on skin inc products and thought to myself no harm trying why not get something since I'm out of my acne cleanser as well? I filtered through the acne control section and saw this cleanser and bought it doubtfully. But to my surprise, this is really different from all the cleansers I've used before. Really moisturizing and gentle on skin I must say. It's the first time my skin don't feel the pulling tightness and rawness after I washed my face with it. Thumbs up for it! But oil control wise, I think it's not that useful. I'm looking forward to more skin inc products in the future! "
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,Fantastic!,"This Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam is good! With just a small pump it's sufficient, lathers without water, should be able to last me for quite awhile! Meanwhile it makes my face feel fresh after every wash, moistured it as well! 

Will definitely recommend to my friends!"
SKIN INC-Pure Prodew Cleansing Foam,,A+,"I have a prone acne skin type and this foam cleanser just saves my life! so to speak. it brightens my skin, helps to clear up zits, even minimize my pores. it doesn't irritate my skin after usage and i feel so fresh after every use. LOVE this and thanks for introducing this great skincare into Luxola! "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,not for me,"Doesn’t work for me. Product is too slippery when squeezed out, it just glides off my face without doing much. Skin still feels oily and dirty after use."
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,very faint effect but smells like spa,"It is surprisingly very gentle and not harsh and suitable for sensitive skin like mine. Although it says to remove after 30seconds, I tend to spend longer with it on my face about a minute plus because it smells like i’m having a spa. The smell of the cleanser is very relaxing, like a treat. However, i have to run by it again with a gentle cleanser as i have large pores and mud cleanser tend to sink in and stays in it which can clog pores. So taking precautions unless u use a toner the next step which would solve this issue too."
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,Love at first try !,"First time trying this, OMG the suppleness and feeling fresh and clean on my face is everything. It won't make your skin dry. I have quite sensitive skin, no itchiness after using this product. This mud series is so good, and it does clean my clogged pores. It reduced a lot even at the first try."
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,not convinced,I wasn't convinced by this product. it feels nice and creamy but I wasn't a fan of the smell. it glides on my skin nicely but didn't seem to have much impact or effect.
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,really cleans my face thoroughly ,"Quite a good cleanser to use if you have very oily face as the mud will rinse away the impurities on the skin, leaving it fresh and squeaky clean. Also the bottle size is also quite big for its price "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,gentle effective cleanser,"This cleanser has an amazing scent and I enjoyed the texture of it. It doesn’t foam but it does leave behind soft, renewed and refreshed skin. Noticed that my skin looks brighter. However, you would need to do a first cleanse to remove makeup before using the pixi mid cleanser."
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,pixi,"I have combination of dry and oily skin, this is the second time I bought this product, it’s working on my skin very well, I’m really satisfied of my purchase "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,Not really impressed ,I’ve been using the cleanser for over 3 months now and I haven’t seen any difference so far. It might cleanse the face but it feels like so greasy and not all the dirt is removed after washing. 
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,not working on my face,"I was given high hope in this product as I heard rave reviews on this brand. however, for my personal preference, I thought that the cleanser shall giving a squeaky clean after wash and it didn't. I could still feel that there was some impurities on my skin."
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,Gentle Chemical Exfoliating Cleanser,I have very sensitive and combination skin. This cleanser works beautifully at cleaning the face and getting rid of dead skin cells without irritation. Overall very mild and leaves skin very smooth and moisturized after cleaning. Second tube I’ve purchased. 
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,My Holy Grail,The best cleanser for my sensitive and acne prone skin. I have struggled with adult acne for a while until I finally tried Pixi skin care line. I always knew that I wanted to try their product which I should have early on. 
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,don't like the feeling ,didn't really like the feeling of this mud cleanser. skin doesn't feel clean after washing your face with it. plus it was hard to squeeze out when it reached towards the end 
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,gentle,"not bad, quite gentle on the skin, but cant remove make up cleanly but dont mind cause will use make up remover anyways. good for any skin type, i have sensitive skin and it works great"
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,present,got this as a present for my sister..she likes it..so thats all i gotta say..but im gonna keep rambling something because i need to have at least 150 characters to submit my review annddd done
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,Glow Mud Cleanser ,"My favorite serie to use , Pixi glow mud cleanser + glow mud mask and glow tonic , I noticed my skin was glowing and it’s not too pricy to try as a set.                "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Philippines,Okay product ,"Not really impressed with the product. Yes, it does cleanse the face but it feels that not all the dirt is being removed. Noticed a glow but not sure if it’s from the toner usage. 
"
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,Good cleanser ,This didn't give me any rashes or breakouts even me having sensitive skin. Skin looked fresh and clear. Very smooth in texture and glides gently. Feels nice on the skin. 
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,best brightening cleanser ,"It’s not very mild or gentle so if you’re into that then this isn’t the cleanser for you- it’s truly brightening, and it feels great and makes your skin feel so fresh and clear- the smell is nice too"
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,PIXI Glow Mud Cleanser,"It doesn't leave you with dry and tight feelings after you wash.
It seems to be able to wash off all the dirt on your face especially after a long day. Pricing is reasonable for the size."
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,love love love,"I have combination normal/oily and it never made my skin break out as I was using drugstore brand before this and calmed my breakout. Eventhough I love Caudalie and everything they do, I tried the Caudalie purifying cleanser and that broke me out non stop and I stopped using that and switched back to this Glow mud cleanser and it calmed my skin back to normal."
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,Not bad,"I first tried this in their mini set and loved loved loved it so I got the big sized one. I felt that the cleanser really cleaned my skin but didn't strip the moisture; awesome as an end of the day facial cleanser. However, near the end of the tube I didn't really feel the benefits anymore so am not so sure about repurchasing it."
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,worth to try,"I love this product. since i used this on my skin routine,it feels like after a long day exposed to dirts when younused it it
 makes your feel clean. it also help to prevent pimples. i would recommend this."
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,nah,"Hmmm my skin usually not sensitive, but this one I think it’s a bit too strong even I just use it once a week. After I washed my face with this my face gets slightly slightly red and itchy. Also this cleanser doesn’t have foam so Im a little bit regret on this purchase. Although it smells so good like all the Pixi products. I think it just not suitable for me. 
"
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,will not repurchase ,"Don’t feel like it cleanses very well. I prefer Paula’s choice perfectly balanced foaming cleanser. Makeup comes off so so well. Not this one, doesn’t seem to remove makeup well. "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Australia,Good Cleanser,I bought this product for my husband as he has oily skin. He has used it few times and he said it is really good. He is very happy with the product!!!
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,nice,Love the texture of the product will definitely purchase this product one more time. And the price is pretty reasonable too for the quality that I have gotten. Am really happy with my incredible purchase hooray. 
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,Mud,"The texture of the product is not soapy. Does not lather much. I find that it is more suitable for oily skin. On combination skin it may leave skin too dry occasionally. Otherwise, it does clean the face."
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,gentle exfoliation ,Spending a short minute massaging this in during facial cleansing really helped to reduce the sebum filaments on the face. It’s the kind of cleanser that isn’t too stripping so there’s no unhealthy squeaky clean feeling after cleansing. 
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,Multiple use!,"I've read so many reviews that are on extreme ends - hate it or love it. I'm definitely loving it. This just works for me because I need a cleanser with glycolic acid content and also one that doesn't give the dry or face-tightening effect after a wash. This also delivers well because of its cream formula, as opposed to those with foam boosting elements which can be a little drying. But I guess it really depends on each person's skin type, whether it can work well or break you out. I wish it was cheaper though! :/"
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,GLOW MUD CLEANSER,"The consistency is ok. I have a combination skin, it does not feel tight after washing. However, I did not feel a big improvement after using the whole tube.  "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,multi cleanser,This cleanser also can be use as a mask. Good to remove excess oil and reduce dirt at your face. The texture is fine and feel nice on the skin. Small not so bad. Overall good product. 
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,review????,I have been restocking this facial wash everytime there is a sale!! this product is rather gentle on the skin & it has a pretty nice smell to it. it doesnt dry me out either 
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,good,"The produt have a good review. Make my fqce more glowing. However, sometimes it add some rashes due to my sensitive skin. The dark spot still visible. Need to try again"
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,meh,"This cleanser did absolutely nothing for me. It did not leave my face feeling clean after cleansing, which is what a cleanser is supposed to do right? "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,Glow with this glow mud cleanser ,"This is a great cleanser for those who has combination skin type like I do. I find that the glycolic acid in this cleanser helps exfoliate my skin in a very mild and gentle way, leaving me with clean, soft and bright skin. It also smells really amazing! "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,10star,"I will rate this cleanser 10 star!! Love it so much. Doesn't make my skin dry after washing, which smthg i really concerned abt. Definitely will buy again!"
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,So-so,"It helps to cleanse without leaving your skin tight, but I wouldn't say it's extremely purifying. No other observable benefits for me. Good if you don't like foaming cleansers but I guess I do prefer foaming cleaners to use along with my Clarisonic! "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,urm not really effective ,"Bought the pixi travel kit, contain 3 item6.. a cleanser, mask, toner.. I repurchase the pixi cleanser in full size thought will it makes the job.. but it didn't really do any ... i was wrong BUY THE MUD MASK INSTEAD!!!"
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,Really mild,"Not very sure about this product. As it is a very mild cleanser, after washing my face I don’t get that “squeaky clean” feeling. I just trust that it does cleanse my face without drying it out. Hence I apply a mud mask (which tends to be drying) after cleansing with this."
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,hm,"I love this, second purchase already and i usually skimp on cleansers because..well its just cleanser. after initially trying this i switched to a cheaper option (cos lets be honest, the price point is steep) but i found myself coming back to purchase this. it leaves a clean feeling without stripping off any moisture, and my skin feels a lot tighter, and gets rid of surface whiteheads. smells like clay but ok."
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,gentle cleanser,"as with the name, it doesn't foam up a lot. it does a good job to gently cleanse the skin. but if you have heavier makeup on, you will need to double clean if you're using this."
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,Be cautious if you have combo skin,"I have combination skin that it can be sensitive to being dehydrated . I give it a 3 star because I find it  good to sink that acne and stubborn acne bumps down within 2-3 days daily application but it is drying to my skin  :( .  It contains glycolic and aloe vera , but maybe the glycolic effect is too strong for my skin tolerance .
However , you can trust the product to help you with the back acne . Yup!"
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,Love the gycolic acid content,"Tried it for the first time after reading some reviews online. For those ladies looking for gycolic acid wash (5%), this is the one! Face feels soft & smooth after washing although the texture is in ‘mud’ form. A good gentle exfoliant wash. "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,okay,Don’t think it was very suitable for my skin cause it made my face feel really dry and tight even though I only used it once a day. Maybe I should have used it on alternate days only.
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,spa feeling ,so I actually really enjoy the cleanser. it works nicely as my second cleanse at night or even during the day. there is a mild scent to it that gives me the vibes of a facial as well as the texture is thick but does not have a heavy feel. I have combination skin and this does not strip off the oils so much to make the skin feeling tight after cleansing. I really do like it  
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,Not doing the job,"I personally felt one of the most useless product from pixi . I love Pixi products but not this. This is doing nothing, after Washing my face with glow mud cleanser,usually i will go with pixi glow toner. And i think the toner does a better job cleansing my face. My cotton pad will be so dirty right after washing my face everytime. I wasted my money! "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,Great,Love it. Repeated purchase. It’s moisturizing with its muddy feel. Skin feels smooth and moisturized instantly. Gentle to skin as well! Recommended to all.
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,Great,The Pixi Glow Mud cleanser evens out my skin texture and bumps.  The glycolic acid concentration is actually enough to have an effect on my skin. I love using this as a pm cleanser.
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,An okay cleanser,"loved it at first but the smell is too powerful and for that price, there are better cleanser. But then again, this is according to my skin, who knows it’ll help your skin!"
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,Okay product ,"use this as my morning skincare routine, it’s okay not soapy and you will get instant glow after you wash your fash. i think this is also good for sensitive skin based on the ingredients "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,Very good ,My first time using of this brand and cleanser and I love it so much. The size is lovely and compatible and you can bring along wherever you go even in small bag. The smell is nice and skin remains soft after using it. No regrets using it.
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,Loveee,"I prefer cleanser without bubble and this one has no bubble at all. Its literally like mud, cleansed ur face pretty well, without making your face feeling tight or dry. Not only youngsters can use it, i gave it to my mom too who is 48 years old. N she loves it. Recommended!"
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,good,First time trying this and im in love. It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. I also realized my skin is less oily after using this. Will repurchase!
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,Seeing improvements ,"The weather has been really humid, causing my face to be really oily during this wfh period, so small reddish bumps have been forming on my cheeks and forehead. I've been using this product for only a week and I'm already seeing those clear up! I love how it's mild, so it doesn't dry my skin out even though it exfoliates. Plus it smells amazing! "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Singapore,Miss,The best cleanser I have found. It leaves the skin super smooth and it's great value for money too. I find it great to use in the day and at night- and my pores have become less visible using this with the glow tonic afterwards and Maria badescu moisturiser to lock it all in. 
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,Malaysia,Works well on my skin,"Since my skin are too oily before, i have tried this cleanser and it really work on my skin especially when i use makeup for a long hours, my skin won’t get too oily even i didn’t use any setting powder. It’s getting normal and this is my 2nd purchase. I think i won’t change my cleanser since this is the best cleanser i ever use better than others that i used before this. The herbal scent is good and not foamy but it cleanse so well🥰 "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,Pixi,I use this non-foam cleanser as my makeup remover.. Works well on my skintype. Skin feel refresh and clean ! Definitely will re-purchase again!Cheers !
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,Holy grail!,This product is the best! It cleared my pimples and small bumps on my skin. However don’t forget to apply sunscreen right after using as your skin becomes more sensitive to sunlight. Convinced my mom and sis to buy this too hehe
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,re-purchased!!!,"idk but i feel that this cleanser makes my skin more glowy on the long run! maybe because i also use the glow toxic toner, but nonetheless, i love how my face is more glowy! "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,Glow Mud Cleanser,Deep cleanser for my skin. Clean and fresh! I use it with foreo mini luna. It works and giving me glowing skin effect. Love it with the reasonable price. This is my second purchase and definitely will continue use it. Recommended!👍🏻
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,nice,Nice smell and it does deep cleanse. Work on me. Will repurchase again. It also work well with glow tonic toner. Use it once in two days and you can see the results after a month
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,meh,I’m not really sold on this cleanser. But I did try to use it on my body wherever I get pimples n it kinda goes away. I don’t like using it for my face. Haha. Prefer using it cosmetics 
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,cleanser ,not suitable for my skin type it's not very foaming so I don't feel fresh after washing my face it's a normal face cleanser nothing great about this one 
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,best cleanser ,Leaving all dirts and grime and make up from my face and make my face feeling fresh and throughly cleanse. A gentle cleanser with a strong power of cleansing
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,no good,"Many have good review on this brand, perhaps for its tonic but definitely not the cleanser! After use, face still feel oily and like not clean, it feels artifical too. Not recommended"
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,Favorit Cleanser,"I like this one very much, it makes my skin clean and smooth after using it. It doesn't dry my skin at all. The price is also affordable, I​ would re-purchase again."
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,"Good, clean texture. ","This mud cleanser has a clay-like consistency and it does not lather. It leaves my skin feeling clean and this is good, but I feel like I need to use more of it since a small amount doesn’t soap up enough to clean my entire face. "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,My everyday cleanser,"I bought this because it contains glycolic acid. At first, I didnt like it because it gives you that “not so clean” feeling after you wash your face with water. It feels like there are still some products left on your face. However, I started to notice that my face is glowing after about a month of using it. And now it has been a year since I started using it and I had repurchased a lot of it. My everyday clenaser"
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,the bomb!,The bomb.the product was perfect for my skin.and i can see the difference in few days after using it. love me. I love sephora products. I’ve been using the pixi glow toner together with this face wash and it’s marvelous.
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,Glowy cleanser!,It’s been 2 weeks since I’ve tried this and i have seen the difference. It does brighten up my skin. And the cleanser is light and creamy but non-foamy though. 
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,Okay,"I don't really feel my face is well cleansed after using this but it is probably because I'm too used to other foamy cleanser. This doesn't produce foam and feels buttery. This would be perfect for normal to dry skin, but not for oily skin I guessed. I had to wash two time with this just to make sure I have all my face dirt removed. "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,Second buy!,"It doesnt dry out my skin at all, yet it feels sooo clean. I really like the texture. I only use this in the evening; my skin becomes sensitive if I use this twice a day. But it definitely contributed to slightly brightening my complexion and reduced my acne breakout. This has definitely become my staple"
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,Pixi user,Hai. Im new to pixi. A friend of mine recommend this. My skin look more radiant with this. Affordable price for the quality. Definitely a must buy cleanser.

PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,😍,Bought this because of all the raves in the comments. I have to say that this is  actually pretty amazing! I love how this product does not foam and its very gentle on my skin. It does not remove all the dirt alone though so you really have to do 2-step cleansing.

"
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,"Great, great, great.","Along with a micellar cleanser, this product has proven effective to leave my face calm at night and with a nice glow in the morning. It hasn't caused breakouts and is also very gentle on the skin. A little goes a long way, too, so value for money is no question."
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,Mild cleaser,I'm not a fan of this cleanser. It smells good but not foamy type of cleanser. Creamy type of texture and I have to use a lot of water to wash my face to make sure all the product face off from my face.
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,i love it!,i have oily skin and this product was rly suited for my skin type. the product was gentle and left a clean but not squeaky clean feeling after wash!! love it!
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,disappointed ,"I was given high hope in this product as I heard rave reviews on this brand. However, for my personal preference, I thought that the cleanser shall giving a squeaky clean after wash and it didn't. I could still feel that there was some impurities on my skin. "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,great product,"I have mild acne, started using the small size, acne treated in a week, now my acne is almost gone, its also suitable for oily skin. Will purchase this product again."
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,I like it.,"I received this item as a complementary product initially, and the sensation I felt after using it is not so bad. So I bought this product as a result. It cleanses my face as much as the next product. Its extra mark is the fact that it is organic and a cruely-free product."
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,everyday must have,"Love this product, gentle yet effective. Leaves a lovely glow. Good for oily/ blemish-prone skin. Very good for value for money  as you need just a small amount, so it goes a long way. "
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,Miss,"At first I didn't like it because it doesn't foam up, and I'm used to foaming cleansers. But this never broke me out and manages to remove the dirt from the day. "

PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,Love it ,Love the texture of this cleanser. Leaves my skin soft after each use. Does not sting nor irritate my sensitive skin. All you need is a small amount to apply on damp skin. Smells great too. 
PIXI-Glow Mud Cleanser,,did not make any difference,"Did not show any significant difference after using 75% of the tube. using it with my foreo. i actually had a breakout even, not too sure if i can attribute it to this cleanser."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),Malaysia,good,"Sudah pakai.. Serasi atau tak, tak pasti lagi.. Sebab baru sekali pakai.. Tengok lama sikit, baru tahu ok ke tak.. Kalau ok, boleh beli lagi nanti.. Harap sesuai dengan muka.. Jenis muka jerawat dan oily "
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),New Zealand,Gentle & effective ,"I love Clinique, normally use the mild cleanser, but I’m glad I tried this one. It’s a lovely light creamy cleanser & leaves skin feeling clean & soft......simple & beautiful."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),Australia,love it ,This is such a good product. Foamed up nicely and had a good coverage around the skin. Cleans soooo well. Was very happy with this purchase. Would recommend 
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),Malaysia,Disappointing,This cleanser is so overpriced.. It doesn't create any foam. it's just like a normal cleansing milk. The dry skin facial wash is way better than this.
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),Malaysia,Wonderful,"I ordered this for my husband and he loves it so so much. He has a very dry skin and sometimes it’s flaky. When he use this, his skin becomes smooth and moisturise all day! "
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),Malaysia,not so,I accidentally bought the wrong one should have gone for (oily skin). I don’t like to use it because there is no foam and it makes my face more oily. Should be more careful next time
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),Australia,Clinique new facial soap money wasting product ,"Ridiculous.it has no soap effect at all.totally money wasting.Naver ever ll  buy again.Clinique gel facia soap for dry skin is good to use.I wonder if it is available to buy or not.
"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),Australia,Not what I was looking for!,"I wanted to try something mild and which doesn't strip my skin as it is already dry and for regular use. I bought this product in hopes for that but I am not sure if this actually cleaned my skin because it didn't feel like so. But it didn't strip my skin or caused any breakouts. Nevertheless, I won't be buying again."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),New Zealand,Good! ,Pretty good product! Works pretty well for my sensitive skin! Doesn’t leave my skin feeling really really clean like some facial soaps do but I use other products to further clean my skin after the soap so it doesn’t really matter! And it’s not super drying like I find some skin care can be. All in all it’s pretty good but not 100% certain I will buy it again
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),New Zealand,This is not a face soap,"Not a face wash. This product has the look and consistency of a moisturiser. It does not lather or have any washing properties, just adds oil to your skin. Very disappointed will not be purchasing again "
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),Malaysia,No fan of this. ,I guess i’m gonna use more than one pump to spread all over my face compare i used Mild. Because this one for dry skin and It has no foam at all and easily to disappear . I Will not repurchase this one. 
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,Didn't work out for me,"Not suitable for me. Maybe it was too mild for my oily skin, maybe I bought the wrong one. I don't know... I thought the reviews I saw online was quite good, until I tried it out myself.

"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,The best,No drama. This is the best for me.  I doesn't make my skin dry and I have been using it for quite sometimes and I don't think I will change to different brand. Still loyal to Clinique ;)
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,normal,Normal facial soap nothing really special just make your face clean nothing special kinda pricy for a face wash will not repurchase not worth it. Prefer the night wash one 
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,Not Sure,"I accidentally bought the wrong one and decided to give it a try. I dont like that it stings after using this. Maybe it just doesnt suit me. 

It is suitable for dry skin."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,Great product!,Washes off easily without leaving a clingy residue. Skin feels calm and smooth after use. I used to use the Mild Liquid Facial Soap but I am a convert to this one now!
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,nice,sangat sesuai untuk kulit saya sebab tiada buih....kurangkan jerawat.saya beli time skincare sale.....dan akan beli lagi walaupun tiada sale.terima kasih sephora........
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,😊,this product so so me because i dont feel any sooth when i applied to my skin. i also didnt find any changes after used it. maybe it didnt suitable for my skin
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,Clinique,"I have been using the mild version of this product for about 12 years now, no kidding! And, I couldnt find anything better. A very refreshing facial wash for the mild. But I wouldnt say the same for the extra mild as it in a lotion form, not soapy at all. Not that satisfying for me."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,Good for dry & sensitive skin,"I bought this wrongly thinking it was the usual one i use for dry combination skin with gel texture. To my surprise, I love this one and I use it during morning. This is a cream cleanser which does not foam and lather, but more hydrating. This does not irritate my skin and I see improvement to redness & dry patches on my face. Dry and sensitive skin will love this! Able to remove makeup on face too, but not completely and as effective as gel-type cleanser. "
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,Not too bad,"This is a super gentle cleanser, I usually don’t use this one to remove a full face of make up, this cleanser I imagine would be great for sensitive skin. Worth the price! When I have used it, it always clears my skin. "
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,Good for dry and sensitive skin,"best cleanser for me so far as i have extremely sensitive and dry skin. it doesnt make my skin feel tight after every wash, but good enough to clear the day's junk and dirt! highly recommended for people who likes cleanser that doesn't lather / foam"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,basic cleanser,a great cleanser if your after a basic cleanser especially for skin that sensitive as this has no fragrance. Its nothing special but would be good for normal type skin. As I am acne prone did not think this was great for that but overall not a bad cleanser at all. 
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,👍,"At first, I don’t like this cleanser. I found that i have to pump too many just to make it foaming and enough to clean my face. However, I found that this cleanser won’t produce any foam even if i use a bottle of it to clean my face😂 then I tried a new technique which is i wash my face 1st and i dry my hand then only i pump the cleanser and rub onto my face and this works!! I can feel that my face i clean and soft and less redness. I just love this product so so recommended. Less half ⭐️ bcause it don’t produce foam😬"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,Just OK for me.,"I personally prefer the Mild cleanser. This cream-like cleanser doesnt lather, which I should have considerd before getting this. Maybe its just not for me. Will continue buying the Mild cleanser instead :) "
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,Clinique Cleanser,"I totally love this product! It works wonder on your skin! :) 5 star!! Your skin feels so soft and soothing. If you have use Clinique's cleanser 3 before, you would notice that the texture is a bit soft as compared to this one since its milky foamy type, but nonetheless its a good change!"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,"My new daily, holy-grail cleanser!","I've been trying to find a facewash that would reduce the redness and dryness from my eczema. I've never felt so confident in myself! It's incredibly gentle, feels great on the skin, and washes off easily. 100% would recommend for anyone with dry, sensitive skin!"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,clinique facial wash,"I have been using this facial wash for 3 years and now even my Mom is also using the same one. It doesn’t make your skin dry in fact even though my skin is a combination oily it doesn’t cause any breakouts at all. It’s really mild for all skin condition. Really recommend it! 
"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,Bought the wrong product!,Bought this thinking that it was tge dry combination type which is the usual type I purchase. Not really a fan of this extra mild version as it makes my skin itch and  more oily after use. Probably more suited to those with eczema and extremely dry skin.
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,good for cold weather,"I have a normal skin, but it gets dry during the winter if I use the regular products, so I decided to try this. I'm satisfied with the product, my skin is adapting well but I'm not in love with its texture. It doesn't feel like I'm applying soap to my face - and it doesn't feel fresh and clean after that. I don't know if I'll buy it again."
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,good for dry/oily combinations skin. ,"A cleanser that doesn't foam up. 
It doesn't leave my skin feeling taut and abit dry after patting my face with a towel. 
One pump is enough to cleanse my face, which is a good thing cause i don't feel like im wasting product. "
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,Burning sensation ,"Clinique is well known for their skincare product. I've tried their facial soap with dish and it is good. The only thing is just it's a soap bar and I feel inconvenience to use sometimes. So, I decided to purchase this liquid facial soap but there is a burning sensation when I was using this. "
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,Clinique liquid Facial Soap Extra Mild ,"I been using Clinique liquid facial extra mild for 1 month its so soft to skin. Skin no more dry after wash its super good for dry skin and ultra gentle to skin. Leave skin feeling clean and comfortable. 

"
CLINIQUE-All About Clean™ Liquid Facial Soap (Extra Mild),,Suitable on Combination skin,"It gets off my makeup perfectly within only 1 wash. This cleanser also works perfectly and doesn't irritate my skin. I have been using this for a week and I cannot believe the difference in my skin. This does not dry my skin out, this is creamy feeling and you only need the tiniest amount! I love that it is unscented. I LOVE this cleanser and I have used some that cost 3x as much, it is a fabulous product."
MALIN + GOETZ-Facial Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Cleans well,My first purchase of cleansing oil from the brand and I really am impressed ! It has an uplifting spa-like scent from its blends of different oil bases and rinses very well with water. I can even skip my cleansing foam which I regularly had to use as second step from using another premium brand. Would surely re purchase.
VOTARY-Cleansing Oil - Rose Geranium And Apricot,Australia,Part of my daily for as long as they make it,Cleans and moisturises really well. I apply to wet skin and after massaging for a bit I leave it then use a toner to remove any residue. It’s lightweight and smells lovely. A little goes a long way for my skin which is pretty balanced. Don’t get breakouts. Skin quality improved since staying this product
VOTARY-Cleansing Oil - Rose Geranium And Apricot,Malaysia,awful,"i dont get the rave reviews. this thing barely removes makeup, it stings the eyes and causes breakouts. considering how expensive it is, i would much rather use regular coconut oil since the efficacy is the same. better off using clinique take the day off or tatcha make up remover"
VOTARY-Cleansing Oil - Rose Geranium And Apricot,Singapore,great product,Helped my friend buy this. It was her first time trying this product. She’s been wanting to try it - And she loves it a lot. It cleanses make up really well and smells great. 
VOTARY-Cleansing Oil - Rose Geranium And Apricot,Australia,Love Love Love it!!!!,Smells divine!!!! This oil cleanser has been my saving grace during these winter months. Easily washes off and leaves no tightness in my skin like most cleansers that I have used that are apparently suitable to dry/very dry skin. Highly recommend!!!!
VOTARY-Cleansing Oil - Rose Geranium And Apricot,Australia,Wow,"After using this product, I realized why Votary cleansing oils are the cult hit. It smells so good and cleans so well without drying. I use it with either Votary terry cloth or the Eve Lom muslin cloth (for a deeper cleanse or to remove makeup) and it gives an almost glass like sheen. It is also perfect for sensitive skin. I pair it with the Votary super seed cream which is also a great product. Not cheap but it's worth every cent.      "
VOTARY-Cleansing Oil - Rose Geranium And Apricot,,Best Cleansing Oil,I love this cleansing oil. it smells divine. It does an excellent job at braking down makeup. It also can be used as a morning cleanser. The face cloth that comes with it is super soft on the skin. It's the best towel ever. 
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Australia,My New Favourite Facewash ,I am loving using this product. A little goes a long way and it suds up but has a milky like texture. It’s very hydrating yet refreshing even in summer. 
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,worth the money ,"I must say, for its price point, it's awesome. It doesn't strip the skin of moisture, yet the skin feels clean and well prepped for moisturizer to glide on. "
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"This is a nice gentle cleanser, it foams up to be quite soft and fluffy. Slightly citrus scented and reminds me of lemon meringue pie."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,A little goes a long way,Giving this more than 5 stars if I could. I finished a tube within 7 months! A little bit goes a very long way because you will need a little bit to foam a lot. Definitely one of the best face wash I have ever used. 
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Bar Soap,Smells and feels exactly like bar soap in cleanser form. Not a fan.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Best cleanser,It cleans really well without drying or stripping the skin
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,one of the best,Been using it for more than 9 months now. Best purchase ever. Helped clear my adult acne and stopped them from coming back. And I have very dry skin.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Effective Anti-Aging Cream Cleanser,"This is a great cream cleanser which I highly recommend for dry aging skin and maybe even acceptable for sensitive skin types as it is gentle and comforting as advertised. It has a light fruity scent which may not be agreeable to everyone, regardless I will most likely be repurchasing as every other cleanser I’ve used pales in comparison to the effectiveness of this one."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,hello bar soap!???,"At some point I stopped washing and asked my boyfriend why it smelled like I was using his body bar soap on my face. After washing off the first area, I immediately regretted this purchase. I may as well have been using bar soap .. the scent is a little overwhelming. Some other individuals say they experienced the same thing but that they swear by this cleanser so I’m willing (I suppose) to use it for a few days / weeks to see if I notice the same changes. I really don’t enjoy feeling like my skin is stripped completely, but with the right serum / moisturizer combo, this would definitely be doable. But not for this price."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,very gentle,This cleanser is very gentle and effective at removing the days dirt.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Game changer,"I love this cleanser SO much. When I first started using it, I did notice that my skin would feel super tight immediately after washing but the longterm impact has been incredible. I actually have to exfoliate half as much as I used to, and my skin texture overall is softer and smoother than it's ever been. I highly recommend, especially if you suffer from small bumps or uneven texture."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Breakout Central!!!!!,Initially when I used this I thought it smelled really good and felt smoothing. I wanted to switch up my cleanser. I found this one made me breakout really bad! I never really had acne besides a few pimples here and there until I started using this. I have pretty dry skin and I think this dried my skin out!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"It claims to not overstrip the skin of its oils, but when I tried it I was way too squeaky clean... nice foaming action though!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,I’d probably give it a 3.5 if I could,"Loves:
- The scent. I am a big fan of delicious scents with my skin care. This one has a distinct citrus scent, strong enough I smell it every time but not so strong that my whole bathroom has the scent or that it stays on my skin after rinsing. 
- The formula feel while washing. I love that just a pea sized amount turns into a luxurious foamy feeling cleanser. I feel clean. 
- Packaging. It’s simple, cute, and I like squeezing tubes that make me feel like I’m getting all the product. 
-Price. Not too expensive and a lot of product. 

Dislikes:
- Drying. As others have mentioned, this leaves a tightness to my skin. It’s not the worst for me but I do not he it some days. 

Overall: don’t know yet if I would repurchase. I’m eager to see if my summer skin likes it more with all the humidity and my sweating and excess sunscreen. May bump it to a 4 if I like it as a seasonal cleanser."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Very drying,Overall this wash is too drying. I have combination skin and would noticed my skin would feel stripped and tight after washing. You will definitely need a good moisturizer after this wash. Might be better for those with very oily skin.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"This cleanser is my holy grail!!!! My skin is glowing and that says a lot considering how extremely sensitive it is. This cleanser makes my skin feel so clean and silky, like never before. I absolutely love it! And the smell is subtle but so good! I recently tried a different brand, just once and immediately switched back to Saturday Skin, it’s just amazing how it makes my skin feel and look."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Felt like bar soap,This does not feel moisturizing at all. It felt the same as using bar soap for my face for my combination skin. This is probably better for someone with oily skin and needs stripping of face oil.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Great for my acne prone skin,"Love this cleanser!  I’ve been searching for a new cleanser that doesn’t break me out, or leave me feeling too dry. This one is perfect.  I used Bobbie Brown’s tube cleanser for years, but it was discontinued and I’ve tried no less than 10 others before I landed on this one. Highly recommend it, I like natural oils in my face cleansers (jojoba, avocado, etc...). No need for a makeup remover with this either. I cleanse twice and I’m set."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"This is probably better for oily skin. I have dry skin, and felt like it stripped my skin and left it feeling too “squeaky clean”. I wasn’t a huge fan of the scent. A little goes a long way, and the texture is really nice! I wished it had worked for me. I don’t hate it, but it’s just not the best fit for what I need."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Works Nice but Strong Smell,"This is a nice, creamy cleanser that does a good job cleansing my face without stripping my skin. However, it has a very strong citrusy smell. It almost smells like house cleaner. If you can get pass the scent, nice solid cleanser."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Horrible cleanser,If I could give this product zero stars I would !!! It made my skin have the worse breakout I’ve ever had !!!!! Horrible and it made my skin so dry I do not recommend this!! Save your money
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,The hype is real!,"I own large sizes of primers and certainly doesn’t need more, but was curious about this and bought the sample size.  Been using a few times so far but really love it!  Makes my makeup look so much better and lasts a good long time.  The scent doesn’ bother me at all considering  most scents give me a headache.  This doubles as moisturizer and primer and has caused no issues with my sensitive skin.  Glad I gave it a try"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,I didn’t care for the scent of this product and found it to be drying for me.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"I haven't quite decided about this product. I like it, but there's a ""but"" in there that I can't quite define. Give it a try."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Disappointed,I wanted to love this cleanser but it makes me break out everytime I use it
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Best cleanser for dry skin EVER!,Gifted by Saturday Skin for my honest review. I have dry skin and this is like the perfect cleanser for me! The texture is so nice and it’s almost hydrating. My skin doesn’t feel tight and dry after using this. I’ve been using this as both my morning and nighttime cleanser and this is helping to save my skin especially during these cold winter months when my skin is usually so dry it’s unbearable! I’ve also noticed my skin looks a little brighter after using not as dull. If you have dry skin like mine I definitely recommend you checking out this cleanser!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,A pass for me.,"The Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser was gifted by Saturday Skin and I was so excited to try it. Unfortunately, it did not work well for me at all. I thought the package design, the scent, and the fact it’s a cream cleanser was great but that’s all the pros for me. Upon opening, my package did take a little effort to squeeze out, multiple times, as for the product itself, I did not enjoy it.  There must be an ingredient in this product that doesn’t agree with me because it left red, irritation marks on my cheeks as well as my skin felt very dry & uncomfortable after using it. I cannot recommend this product based on my bad experience."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Way too drying!!,I bought this a WHILE ago and I finally used the entire bottle up ( only because it was too expensive to just throw away ) it has good reviews but definitely drys my skin out like nothing other. I generally have dry skin and this california tap water makes it worse! this cleanser didn't make my skin feel clean or soft and actually broke me out a bit! I'm glad it's gone and I can finally replace it with something else. if you have dry skin definitely stay away!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Amazing!,I received this product complimentary from Saturday Skin for testing and reviewing purposes. This cleanser is so amazing! I have very sensitive skin and it works perfectly for me! Might be my new favorite cleanser now!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Nice cushiony cleanser,"Gifted by Saturday skin for review. I loved the cushiony foam, it felt very soothing on my currently parched skin. Not stripping at all. A little bit goes a long way. I used a dime sized amount but even a pea sized amount would work great! Loved this cleanser"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Nice!,"I received Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser complimentary from Saturday skin in exchange for my honest review.

This cleanser has light citrus scent, nice texture and leaves skin feeling ultra clean. It doesn't dry my skin out. I haven't noticed any irritations as well."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,AMAZING!,"This cleanser was gifted by Saturday skin. First of all, I love the consistency of this cleanser, so foamy, gentle rich and smells amazing. Feels very nice on the skin, I feel like it’s so delicate and yet so effective! It takes so little product, which is great.  I had heavy make up on my face and this cleanser delicately removed it. Doesn’t dry the skin out and leaves the skin so smooth and fresh. I love it. Second of all, the design is gorgeous:simple and cute! Very girly. Overall, I’d recommend it!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,Highly recommended,Love this product so much.  This cleanser cleans my skin thoughly without drying the skin. Am into my third tube. Highly recommended.  Tempted to try the other products in the same range. 
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Loved!,"After only a week I can tell a difference! My pores look smaller, my skin is glowing and feels so soft. I have combo skin/ more on the dryer side so I was a little worried looking at the other reviews. But it does not feel drying at all to me. I follow it up with some serums and moisturizer though. I also love how much it lathers up, you only need a VERY little amount. Love it! Will definitely be buying again."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"This product dried my skin out irritated it and caused me to break out. It is a very harsh cleanser I agree with the other reviews that would be more beneficial for someone with very oily skin. Very disappointed. The name is extremely misleading, it is in no way a gentle cleanser. It actually made my skin have a burning sensation when I used it. Do not buy if you have even slightly dry or sensitive skin"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,phenomenal,"this is the best cleanser after using an oil cleanser. im obsessed with this. seriously tho, a dot does the trick. a little goes a loooooooong way!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,awesome for hormonal acne!,"Works well on my acne prone skin.  I haven’t gotten any more hormonal acne bumps since using this cleanser. Leaves my skin super soft, cleansed and not overly dry.  I will definitely be re-ordering."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"A little goes a long way! New favorite; love using it with the scrub, too."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,leaves a film,"Really wanted to like this cleanser but it left a film feeling on my skin after using every time. Didn’t feel clean, pretty uncomfortable"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,wax wash,I HATE this cleanser and am so disappointed. It has a great lather but the second I rinse it off my face feels like I rubbed candle wax all over it. Does not remove all traces of my makeup.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Love this cleanser. It’s so gentle and a little goes a long way. I really like the smell and I haven’t found it to be stripping unless I use too much product.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Only a wee bit needed,"This is a skin cleaner. Your face is clean to the point of almost feeling stripped of oils. You will definitely feel clean, however you will need to replenish with serums and moisture cream."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Don't understand the hype. Very average product.,"Don't understand the hype. There is literally nothing great about this cleanser, it is very average as to any cheap products you find at drug stores. More similar to Innisfree products which cost a fraction of the price but literally are the same."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,don’t recommend it,I honestly didn’t like it. I used to use Estèe lauder I regret that I changed it when I saw a lot of good reviews on this product. it irritated my skin and I had skin break out .
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Strips skin. Skin was so dry after. Gets make up off only ok. Lasts long
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"This is a good cleanser for someone with combo skin as it does give a refreshing, clean feeling. It is a bit stripping though so this isn’t something I reach for daily. There is also a scent as fragrance is really high on the ingredient list."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Huge Fan,My skin is finicky and doesn't tend to like most cleansers. This cleanser is refreshing and my skin loves it! I’m 100% loyal to this cleanser and highly recommend this!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,ehh,"The packaging is pretty, the product is gentle, BUT there is fragrance and it is not a necessity. There are way better, more effective, and cheaper cleansers out there!!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,Mdm ,"I have tried many other brands , some left with greasiness , some caused dryness ... Saturday Rise + Shine gentle cleanser is the best ! Even used during my harsh weather Oversea trips ... it never fails me at all ! Felt so clean each wash !  "
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"Harshly strips skin and makes it feel tight, would only recommend to someone that had very oily skin."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"While I like how nicely it cleansed my face, I don’t like the fact that citrus essential oils are so high up in the ingredient list. They are too irritating and sensitizing even in a wash off form, and this high up of concentration can really cause long term damage."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Do NOT buy!!!!,This product strips your skin terribly. It gives you that squeeky clean feeling that you can’t feel any moisture left in your skin. I tried to enjoy it but I will be attempting to return when stores are open. Waste of money.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Gets it ALL!,"I bought this cleanser due to someone elses review of how much it really cleans the face, and gets all the makeup. I don't wear a ton of make up anyway because I'm pretty prone to break outs. 
I started using this maybe a week ago and OH MY GOSH, the other person was RIGHT!  My skin looked SO fresh and so clean. Even my blemishes were a little lighter. Less than a dime size amount will get be plenty. Its thick and lathers nicely. I highly recommend this, and will be purchasing again.  (And the pore clarifying toner, and the water fall glacier cream )"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,So gentle and cleansing! On my second bottle. Bought based on the reviews and it did not disappoint.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Holy grail!!!! BEST CLEANSER EVER!!!!!!!!! My skin has never felt better than this Amazinggg.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,In love with this cleanser,"I love the rub a dub mask so much I decided to give the cleanser a try...LOVE IT!!!  took all my make up off...left no residue at all....just squeaky clean skin. Plus, the smallest amt goes a long way.  Give it a try!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,holy grail,"I have been using this cleanser for about a year and a half now and I REFUSE to try anything else!! It has changed my skin! After using this my skin appears brighter, softer, and much more hydrated. It does not make my face feel like its been stripped. It's also amazing for removing makeup!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Definite re-purchase.,This is the second time I have bought this. It’s an amazing cleanser that will leave your skin feeling squeaky clean. Takes off all make up. I mean everything.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Buy it! Please trust me. I value your $ too,"Wonderful product. I am an esthetician -- graduated from AVEDA in 2010. This whole line is awesome and effective. I mean this. You'll be happy with it. Stay with, be consistent, and give it time. Like everything regarding your health. You'll be happy with this one and you'll notice over the years the difference these ingredients make. Trust me. And a lot of the alcohols listed are naturally derived from fruit (which have very strong alcohols!). USE ONLY AS DIRECTED. I works and it an AMAZING price for this quality of product. I am very pleased and highly recommend."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,More like a cute packaging trap.,Makes a soapy foam like that does not feel gentle. Cleans but not leaves the fresh sensation. Not impressed.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"I’m confused why some people say that this product smells amazing, to me it doesn’t really have any scent and it is kind of liquidy, not what the picture shows. But overall it’s okay, I’m not very impressed by it but I certainly don’t hate it either."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"I have dry and sensitive skin, it makes your skin squeaky clean. But dries too much, and doesn't help with improving skin texture. I really wanted to love this, I kept using it, but after 2 months of trying to love it I gave up on it. :("
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Stripped skin badly,"This product was the beginning of the end for my skin.

I got a sample of this from a sephora employee after telling them I have sensitive skin and it stripped my skin so bad it felt tight and dry. 

I looked at the ingredients and VERY high on the list is lemon essential oil and a bunch of other citrus oils. I freaking wish companies would stop using essential oils improperly. Especially citrus oils are very exfoliating to the skin and should only be used in low dilution.

This product contributed to my skin getting over processed and I do not recommend."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Not for me,"I wanted to love this stuff I really gave it a try but it's too harsh on my face, strips it of everything, made me have severe dry patches, I see it has a ton of good reviews so it might be better for people with oily skin, it smells really nice too like lemons, but yeah it just didn't work good for my skin unfortunately"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,My new favorite skincare brand!,"This, ladies and gents, is the holy grail of cleansers!! I've tried A TON, and this one is simply the best. You don't need a lot, honestly, half a dime of product will clean your entire face and neck, and it produces wonderful silky foam. I've bought 2 so far, one for my apartment, and one for my boyfriend's. Trust me, try it and you will not be disappointed!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Foams Up So Nice!!,Very foamy. Really makes me feel I’m getting a great face wash. Smells good. I use a make up brush and apply the face wash. Smells good and I love that it’s a clean product!!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,not for dry skin,This cleanser is so good at removing makeup and oil. But I have dry skin and it leaves me with that tight feeling.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,WANTED TO LOVE THIS,"But unfortunately this product was not effective for my skin. I have very dry skin that I dehydrate more by drinking coffee in the morning and wine at night. Lol

This wash is sooooo soft and creamy, smells amazing and has helped keep my skin clear of congestion and break outs. HOWEVER, it leaves my face and neck SQUEEEEEEAKY clean. I find that I have to really lather on moisturizer to balance out everything that was washed away. I think this might be great for oily skin. But my face does not like it. I’m still so flakey in some spots."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Amazing and unique cleanser,"I love this cleanser! By far my favorite brand. A little bit goes a long way and the texture is so silky and soft. I’ve never felt a texture like it and it’s amazing. My skin feels so soft and clean afterwards. My skin has never looked better, Saturday Skin has been a lifesaver!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,This is a great basic cleanser. I use topical tretinoin and clindamycin and I had to irritation or side effects!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Not suitable for dry skin,"I have dry sensitive skin，and this cleanser is gentle didn't make my skin itch, cleans pretty well, but makes my skin very dry like the Sahara desert... Strips the moisture out of my skin."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,one of my favorites,"I have repurchased this cleaner at least four times and love it! For me it removes every trace of makeup and leaves my face super clean. I switched to this cleanser because I have hormonal acne, since using I have not had 1 breakout and my skin is clear. The only issue is that it’s drying, I use a rich moisturizer after so no dry patches or uncomfortable tightness. My skin type is combination and sensitive. It lasts a long time because you only need a pea sized amount for a rich lather. I would try a sample first for dry, sensitive skin because it may be too harsh for this skin type."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,strips skin,"The texture and scent are great, but sadly that’s about it. This cleanser really strips your skin and leaves mine feeling very tight and “squeaky clean” which isn’t supposed to happen. Disappointed :("
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Terrible for sensitive skin,"Not sure why Sephora did not approve my last review but I figured if I’d try again.  This product was absolutely terrible for my eczema prone/sensitive skin.  I should’ve paid attention to the ingredients list rather than trusting the “clean” stamp label.  There are a lot of very abrasive essential oils that severely dried out my skin, giving me the worst eczema flare up I’ve ever had.  I only used this product about 2-3 times per week and after a balm remover that I’ve been using for years.  I hope this review goes through to save others with sensitive skin from the pain."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Not for me,Love the creamy texture and smell. Like soft lemon. But I felt it didn’t take makeup off and left a weird film on my skin
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,It’s a nice cleanser. It is a little thick which isn’t my favorite but works nicely.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"My holy grail! This is my favorite cleanser. I will occasionally switch to another face cleanser to mix it up and see if I like something better, but I always regret it and go back to this one. My combo skin thanks me for it when I go back to it. It is such a clean, fresh feeling. Doesn't leave a funny residue on my skin and I have noticed a positive difference in my pores being smaller and less oil production in my TZone."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Love!,"So far so good.  I've been using it for about 2 weeks.  I have combination skin, a little oily in tzone and normal in other areas.  I use this with my clarisonic.  My first impression was that it didnt feel as if it was cleaning my skin, but once I rinsed it off and dried my face,  my skin felt so clean.  Hours later my skin still looked so fresh and the only areas looked less oily.  It's the first time I purchase this cleanser and I'm very happy with it.  I like to switch them up often and I use a pre cleanse before I use this cleanser.  I would definitely recommend to combination/normal skin.  Even without the clarisonic, my skin still felt fresh and clean after use."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,This is NOT Gentle,I bought this because it said it was gentle and there are lots of positive reviews. I thought it lathered well and washed off most of my makeup. My black liquid eyeliner that isn’t waterproof took much more scrubbing to get off. It felt tight that my skin felt stripped. I don’t have sensitive skin but dry and sometimes in the winter get small dry patches under my eyes. Using this made my skin feel so dry. I used my usual lotion and I felt burning. After about an hour I started to feel some itching. It wasn’t an allergic reaction more like the product was harsh. The smell isn’t great either. The next day I had some red rash-y areas. I never had an issue with acne or breakouts not even as a teenager. Needless to say it’s in a box going back.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Acne breakout and squeaky feeling,"I never write reviews but this product broke my skin out and I never struggle with acne. It also gave my skin a squeaky feeling along with my hands after rinsing. Not the squeaky clean feeling, it felt more oily like it hadn’t even washed my face at all. Really wanted to love this product but I’m going to trash it and go back to philosophy purity made simple cleanser."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,fitting name-gentle cleanser,Great gentle cleanser. I got this to try out since I was looking for something gentle on my hormonal acne prone skin and I love Korean skincare so I figured why not try this. The ingredients were appealing and as it turns out this was a great cleanser. My skin always felt clean but not stripped after washing my face and it didn’t irritate my sensitive skin. The only problem I have with this cleanser and this may just be a personal issue but my skin because very oily after I use it. I would wash and follow with my regular skincare routine but I would end up looking so greasy the next morning when I wake up or throughout the whole day. It is possible that this formula was working against me and removing my natural oils as well when i used it but like I said it was not stripping. It just didn’t work for me.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,"Ok cleanser, best to use for skin without makeup.","Very gentle cleanser. I wanted to try different cleansers to see what would work best with my skin. I use full coverage makeup with setting spray afterwards. Cleanser doesn’t seem to remove all the foundation the first time, usually have to use it twice in order to ensure my makeup is all off."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,High pH and drying,"This has a pH of 9 and it left my skin way too squeaky clean. My skin felt stripped and tight, which is never a good sign."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,HOLY GRAIL for anti-aging face wash!!,"I am sooooo happy I took a chance on this face wash. I had never heard of the brand before & didn’t really know where to start to look for a great anti aging face wash but this IS IT! I was looking for something to target fine lines, wrinkles, dark spots, uneven skin tone/texture/.. and I truly feel like Saturday Skin does it all. It takes off makeup, it hydrates & plumps skin for a dewy fresh glow. It is gentle enough to use on my one year old, is vegan & you only need a dime size amount at a time. I recommend this to everyone & anyone looking for a vegan, plant based amazing YOUTH RESTORING cleanser. I suggest following with Olenherskin Glow 2O Dark Spot Toner, anti-aging serum of choice & AM/PM moisturizer."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,I love it but dries up your skin,"I've been using this product on and off but still, I can feel a weight off my face. One thing I don't like about this product is that it leaves my face feeling like rubber. I immediately need to moisturize it with something after applying it which is ok."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Bad breakout,Gave me bad breakout after the first use - I decided to give it more try and continue using it for a month or so - it only got worse. Gave it to my boyfriend and caused breakout on his skin as well. Really wanted to love this product but I won't recommend it.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"This a great, gentle cleanser. It doesn’t dry out my skin and it is very lightly scented. I would definitely recommend for an everyday fave wash!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Truly amazing cleanser,"As a skincare junkie I’ve used a lot, and I mean A LOT of cleaners and this one is THE best. Once you start using it, it gets super foamy so a little bit goes a long way. Literally a dab is all you need for a full face of bubbles. After rinsing and drying, my face felt velvety soft, and not stripped or dry at all. Plus, it smells great too. Love this cleanser!!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"This cleanser cleans well and smells great, but it unfortunately leaves my skin feeling very dry. For that reason, I would not repurchase it, but I can see others enjoying this product. Another plus for me is that it did not cause my sensitive skin to break out as other products often do-- I just wish it wasn't so drying."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Clean and happy,"This is cleanser is kind to my problematic sensitive skin.  I have acne prone, combo skin.  It does not irritate and performs well!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,This was just OK. Did not break me out and my face was clean after use but it left my face feeling 'tight' and stripped of moisture. Not worth the price to me.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Best for clean skin,Great product! Smells like lemons when its on the face. Just be aware it will not take all your makeup off. Its more for a clean face to be applied. I havent breaked out after using this product so i will give it 4 stars because it doesnt take all of my makeup . A little goes a long way! Love the pink packaging so cute!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Amazing product,This cleaners is amazing. It’s make my skin shine and brighter. I’ll recommend for everybody. I’m looking forward to more products of this brand.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Great gentle cleanser,"Great gentle cleanser. Doesn’t leave my skin dried out. My skin just feels refreshed. Does a good job at removing makeup. I previously used Soy face cleanser, and while I really liked it, it did not remove makeup very well. This cleanser leaves my skin feeling great but I don’t have to scrub multiple times to get foundation off."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"I had been needing a good cleanser that was easy on my skin and didn't make me break out. This is definitely the one. To get the best results, use with the moisturizer!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"Nice, everyday gentle cleanser. Product emulsifies to a rich lather and has a lovely, mild fresh scent."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,good cleanser!,"it’s a really good cleanser. it works well with my sensitive skin. the formula is a bit runny but other than that, i really like this cleanser. it’s helped me with my acne lol"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Pinch me I have to be dreaming,"I’ve been using this for two weeks now. I have very oily skin and it’s pretty sensitive once we get into products that are deep cleansing and oil fighting. A lot of them end up burning me before I can rinse the soap off and then my skin is dry and red for days because it has stripped every once of oil out. Not this product. It must beat the fruit extracts that make the difference but my face has really cleared up and the oil is totally under control. I’ve been working out pretty regularly the last few weeks which makes my oil production go through the roof. Every morning I wake up to a few tiny tiny Whitehead’s on my forehead And skin and that’s how I know this is really working to push out impurities. I also travel everywhere with ole henriksen grease relief wipes and I haven’t had to use them in about a week and a half. The product is scent free for the most part. I swear I can smell the faintest scent of fruit like trick cereal or something. But with one sniff it’s fragrance free. The product itself is very creamy I use about a half a dime amount add a drop or two of water and lather it on my fingers and spend about two minutes massaging the product into my face. With just one splash of water it all comes right off and doesn’t leave any residue behind. I typically find left behind on my cotton pad when I tone but nothing here. Amazingly my oily skin feels squeaky clean as if I used a microbead or exfoiliant but it doesn’t feel stripped. Just clean and soft. I’ve really never felt something like this. I’m also so so so happy to see how simple the packaging is. You get more than enough in a very basic pink tube. I love when I pay for product and get product I’m really tired of all the outlandish packaging that drives the price point up. Great face soap. If your face is typically an oil slick and you are sensitive to those harsh cleansers for oily skin. Try it!
I received this product for free from Influenster and Saturday Skin for testing purposes."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Amazing product!,Clean skin with no stripping feeling and an overall improvement in skin clarity and suppleness. I love this product so much!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"I purchased this product after Laniege re-formulated their multi old cleanser (bummed). I only like cream cleansers for my skin and this received similar reviews so I decided to try it. This isn’t as creamy of a consistency but I do use a face scrubber which helps create a nice lather. It leaves my skin squeaky clean which I like and visibly removes all dead skin, makeup etc. which is what I look for in my cleanser. Solid replacement"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Cleansing Gelee/Refiner 150ml,Malaysia,my ski not loving it,Maybe I didn't read enough. This cleanser is good for oily skin but my skin is dry like sahara dessert. I only use this during my period because that was the only time my skin will acting out.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Cleansing Gelee/Refiner 150ml,Malaysia,Great exfoliater,My mom uses this. She has sensitive skin. So she uses 3-4 times a week. She mentions it gives a smooth finish once used. Skin feels soft too. She will use this with the cleanser

ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Cleansing Gelee/Refiner 150ml,,worth the money ,"Been using it for almost a month, good cleanser for oily skin, skin feels smooth and clean after using it.

ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Cleansing Gelee/Refiner 150ml,,Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Cleansing Gelee/Refiner 150ml ,"Absolutely love this product and recommended it to my sister and my aunt. This scrub is really refined it does not hurt your skin and is good for daily use.  It smells really good and the micro beads are very concentrated you only need to use a really small quantity (approx. one pea size) for the entire face. As such, one tube really can last a long time, mine lasted about 6 months. Highly recommended. "
ESTÉE LAUDER-Perfectly Clean Multi-Action Cleansing Gelee/Refiner 150ml,,Almost perfect ,"This is my first time trying 
Estee Lauder's product and

It has a microbeads that leaves

effect on my skin."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,good you should try,my skin feels soft after the first used. one bottle last about 6 months. minus one star for the pricy
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Singapore,la mer,it's ok.. it does cleanses my face and smoothen out ny face but I have also tried other products that does the same but is slightly less pricey.. might not purchase this again though..
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Singapore,Love the scent and face feel smooth ,"Wow , first time buying LA MER product.  No regret . Simply LOVE the scent and after using my face feel smooth and it's really worth the price .Will try other products from LA MER. "
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Love it ,"The cleansing gel has a ‘herbal’ scent which I personally love it! It is soothing and my skin does not feel dry or ‘tight’ after using it. Just a tiny bit of cleaning gel is enough to cover the face and neck. However, I will try out the foam type since I have the sample from the counter. "
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,lovveeee,"I do used La Mer products’s range. And i love it. I got small size before and try it. And luckily it suit with my skins. The texture so good and The smells too. I used it day and night and feel my skin much better. Feelin fresh.It doesn’t make my skin any big changes which is good. Even though it a bit pricey, but it good to me. So maybe i will keep repurchased it. Thank you La Mer for good products ."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Singapore,So Lux ! So Good!,Using this at the end of a hectic day just gives me joy. The fragrance is light and refreshing. And using this in the morning doesn’t dry out my combi skin. Love it!
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,The Top/Lid is clear not Silver as pictured,"The Top/Lid is clear not Silver as pictured, other than that I like it and I will buy it again !"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Singapore,Clean and clean,Constant purchase for this cleansing gel. One of the better cleanser out there! Bottle is weighty and worth it for the price. I prefer to foamy texture however will use this on days for gentle wash 
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,la mer cleansing gel 100ml,"One week after using it, I love it. My face feels clean and fresh and soft. There’s no tightness of my skin. Which is a good sign for me. Despite what others have said about the smell, I have nothing against it. It smells like cucumber maybe? Which I love! I am giving it four stars because the bottle cap is loose! Imagine taking this with me when I travel! Such a hassle when the it can’t be closed properly. For such a price and the quality of the packaging is sad. Come on Lamer! "
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,WOW this was so much better than I imagined. It foams up real nice and the smell reminds me of a rich fancy hotel that puts those elegant bottles in the bathroom. It has improved my skin without drying it. I also bought the other La Mer cleanser that’s a lotion and find it excellent. If I had to pick one I’d chose the other one but since I struggle with acne I will use both. This in the morning and the other one at night. The bottle is big so it will last a long time. You only need 1 pump. It’s worth the money for sure!
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Singapore,My Fav!,"This is the best cleanser on repeat mode. I love the smell. It can last me longer usage. Yes it expensive, but faster shrink my breakouts. I felt clean after using this. I just love this cleanser"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Amazing Cleanser,"Amazing cleanser. I bought as my daily cleanser, but was surprised to learn that I could use it as a deep cleanser too. It takes off makeup well (1.5-2x pumps for make up, 1x pump without) even without makeup remover (not something I suggest doing, but if you run out it works!). The scent is light. I personally  prefer one without, but this one is tolerable since it’s very light. The thing I like most about the cleanser is the refreshed cleansing that lasts longer in the day than other ones I’ve tried before (the oiliness in the t-zone has stayed away even until evening, could be the weather or hormones but I’d like to think it’s my facial routine)."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"I am fully addicted to this cleanser… it is my favorite smell in the world, bar none, so I’m surprised to see many that don’t like it.  The cleanser is fine but I honestly buy it for that celery-like smell!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,My go-to,This is my 3rd bottle of cleanser. It is very gentle on my skin. The whole bottle lasts for months- at about 3-4 months for myself. It is definitely on the pricier side but it's def worth it! 
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,Horrible. Not sure if the product was expired but it make my acne much worse .. I tried different days to make sure and it was definitely this. Don’t recommend if you are prone to acne or oily skin.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"I had to think long and hard about spending $95 on a cleanser but so glad I bought this. One bottle has lasted six months using it twice a day. You only need a tiny bit to emulsify and using this along with my PMD sonic face  brush I’ve never had cleaner, clearer skin. Paired with the La Mer gel cream moisturizer thus cleanser has turned my skin around in the best way possible. Love the fresh scent and the gel formulation."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Excellent Choice!,"Buying this so many times already. In love on so many sights. Lol. You should really give a try, very gentle to your skin and it does the results. And compliments my Foreo"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Hands down to the best cleanser,"I LOVE THIS CLEANSER. i've been searching high and low for a cleanser that wldnt dry up my skin after double cleansing (im using shu uemura cleansing oil). i've tried most of the Korean cult favorite cleansers and nothing beat this. i tried using small sample which i get it from LM. and love it instantly. The smell of it is also refreshing and quite unique. The price though. But tiny bit (dont pump fully!), just a very gentle slight pump will be more than enough, it will lather a lot but still not drying. "
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,A bit pricey.,Less review I can see from online for this product and I think it is a bit pricey. This cleansing gel doesn’t has a good smell and it was a bit difficult to wash off .
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Disappointed!,The smell is awful and too strong! Couldn’t stand it. Too bad there’s no smaller size for this product. Had to finish the 200ml. Ergh. Won’t repurchase again.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,i have been using this since my mom tossed me the samples when i was 11. i love this cleanser but it is pricey!! i feel like it cleans really well and lasts a LONG time though!!!
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Buy something else.,The smell is awful. I used it twice and returned it. Way too much money for face wash that smells outdated.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Sensitive skin and I prefer the gel to the foam,"Although this is supposed to be more more oily skin, I have dry/sensitive skin and I really like this cleanser.  I was torn on which of the different cleanser formulations to order (gel, foam, oil, lotion) and decided to go with the gel due to the number of reviewers for the foam who called out it made their skin feel dry, tight, and irritated.  

I've been using this for a little over a week and really like it so far. Seems to be mild, my skin doesn't feel tight or overcleansed.  I've only been using it once a day; I use the micellar water to clean my face in the mornings. The scent is pleasant, sort of a clean/aquatic/marine neutral scent.  

I wish this came in a travel size. I may try the cleansing foam as it looks better for travel and does come in travel size, but will likely continue using the gel when at home."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,love it!!,"This is my favorite facial cleanser. Cleans, heals and prevents breakouts."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,MY MUST HAVE IN MY SKINCARE,"This is my first time writing a review. I love this product. Been using it for a week now along with the toner and my face feels so clean & soft. I feel like it works great for my dry skin. Give it a try, I love it. I saved up for them. Just wish it wasn’t so expensive, other than that it’s great!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Canada,Great investment,Great investment.  I’ve had this now for 1 year and it’s part of my skincare routine.  Pleasant scent and my face feels so clean and fresh.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Good Cleanser,"Although it has a slightly unpleasant smell, it’s a good cleanser that’s been helpful with my acne and some minor scarring
I may use it twice a day if my face feels gritty, sweaty, etc.
I also use (follow-up) the micellar water, the treat lotion then moisturizing soft cream (day or very warm weather) or the crème de la Mer (night or cold weather)"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"Thrilled with this cleanser, and a little goes a very long way!!! The fresh scent is really nice as well."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Canada,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,Amazing product. All of this brands products are perfect. Gentle but cleanses throughly. Smells amazing.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Canada,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"My favourite cleanser by far ! Love this product , it cleans leaving the skin so  nice and glowing , it’s smells so nice and fresh . Definitely a repeat , it  so worth it !"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,The best cleanser I have used hands down. I know this is a little pricey but this leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean/ literally nothing else compares. Fairly gentle for all skin types and this bottle lasts me forever. Definitely worth the price tag I will never use another cleanser. The gel works up a nice sudsy bubble and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and bright.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Canada,Best la mer cleanser,"This is my favourite by far of all of the cleansers. My skin is remarkably improved after use, but it is worth mentioning that I also find it to be thier most drying cleanser. I only use this once a day for that reason (at night) but have no issues with dryness when I wake up. I have slight dermatitis around my nose and one eye, and it does aggravate it when I use this product - but again, no issues upon waking! I love this product!!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Broke me out,This looked really good so I purchased it. It broke me out on my jaw line and I will never purchase this again.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Love it,"Can’t get over the smell, it’s fresh and beautiful.  It’s aggressively expensive but it does do an amazing job. It’s gentle, foams lightly and leaves me feeling clean AF"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Luxe,"I have dry skin and love this cleanser. The smell is luxurious, it foams perfectly, and one pump in the shower to wash my entire face and décolleté."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Amazing!,Hate to say it because it’s so pricey! But It’s amazing! It’s expensive but if you can afford it just get it! Squeaky clean
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Amazing if in your budget,"So La Mer is pricey. It’s expensive stuff. I started using the soft lotion in college because my skin was terrible (so many breakouts and huge pores) and it changed my life. I would have loved to use the whole line but I couldn’t afford it. Fast forward to now, I have a little bit of a bigger skincare budget. I love this cleanser. It smells heavenly, cleans so well, and helps manage my breakouts. Is it the best gel cleanser I’ve used? Definitely. It lasts me about 9 months- you only need half a pump for your whole face- and I look forward to cleansing every morning and night. But at the end of the day, it is a luxurious gel cleanser. If I had to go on a still strict budget I would spend it on the soft cream and treatment lotion, both which are life changing. If you can afford this cleanser it’s lovely. But it’s not the best of the la mer line if you’re on a budget. I will continue using this as long as I can afford it!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Disappointing :-(,I love love love la Mer but this broke me out on my forehead and jawline. I think it’s too perfumed for my temperamental skin. Sent back!
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Canada,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"The cleansing gel is great. I use it in conjunction with the cleansing oil and its fabulous. It lasts forever and leaves skin clean and does not dry it out.

I highly recommend this product and will never remove this from my skincare regime!

Btw, I had combination skin and rosacea."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,refreshing scent,"I love the smell of this, it’s a very cooling cucumber/seaweed scent. Doesn’t do much for my skin as far as clearing it up but it’s a nice face wash to use for daily cleansing."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,Did not like it . Was difficult to wash off. Too expensive for what it offers.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,I love this,I wanted to hate this . But I got a sample then ordered 2 bottles . It legit makes my face look cleaner than any other face wash and leaves a glow I love it . I have acne dry skin and this stuff works . I’m a regular girl I use a lot of stuff from my dermatologist so I like to explore skin care . I love skin care more than makeup . This is the only face wash I’ve used where I saw a difference . I never stick with the same face wash when one runs out I buy a new one from Sephora . I will never use another face wash again but this . My credit card is sad believe me but it’s worth it . The bottle is huge . This will last me months .
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,I'm confused but it works really well!,"I got a sample of this bc I wanted to try it and I love the way it smell and it really does clean my face well and I think it may provide a more youthful appearance but it's not worth $95. I normally use clinique face wash or the body shop eucalyptus face wash.. and they both work to clean impurities in my skin. But this did deeply clean,, so maybe I will buy it.. Hmmmm"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,My new favourite skin cleanser!,"I love this cleanser. I'm careful with cleansers because I don't want to use anything that gives my face a squeaky clean feel or leave residual product. That just feels like all natural oils in my skin is being stripped off. I go back and forth between 2 cleansers, this one and the youth for the people superfood. No breakouts and the bottle pumps just a tiny amount onto my clairsonic which is all I need. My face feels clean. My first La Mer product and I'll most likely stock up on this during the rouge sale. My new favourite cleanser. I've been using for the last few weeks and the bottle looks like I've barely used it. I can see it lasting for a while. I remove all make up first and then wash face so I'm not having to use lots of cleanser."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Not for dry skin type,"I got a sample of La Mer Cleansing Gel and used it for about 2 weeks. You really need just a small amount to make it foam and leather. That’s the beautiful part about it. The glass container costs $95 but there is lots of product and I’m sure it would last me a year. It perfectly cleanses my skin and removedxmake up. I have also tried it with my Clarasonic Mia and it worked well.
On the negative side, it smells like cheap shampoo and it can be pretty hard to wash it of your face. I really feel like I’m washing my face with hair shampoo or shower gel. And after I finally wash it off, my face feel very tight, dry and I even have some redness (I would advice not to use it with a face brush if you have dry/sensitive skin). I also noticed my skin started peeling off (too drying) and I had to stop using this product. If you have normal/oily skin type, this product could work for you."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,LOVE!!!❤,I have tried so many cleansing gels over the past few years. I would have to say I have found the Holy Grail of cleansing gels! I love love thicleansing ng gel! I will  certainly repurchase for sure. I highly recommend ❤❤
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,love the foam,"This product has been sold out for a few weeks, even at Nordstrom’s. The sales associate at Nordstrom’s advised me that it is the company that hasn’t been shipping this product due to redoing the packaging l. She was nice enough to give me a few samples of this and I have been using it along with the la Mer cooling cream and my face has never felt or looked so clean and clear. I have rosacea on my cheeks and this cleanser has helped so much with small blemishes and cleared up my skin tremendously. Please!!!! Bring it back so I can get a bottle!!!!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Long Lasting,Good smelling thick texture which cleans well even taking my mascara off. I have oily skin and still had some breakouts with this. No dryness though. Just finished the bottle and it lasted a year and four months with regular use. Overall pretty good and minus the price and some breakouts.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,"Soft, Gentle, Great Smelling","Fell in love with this product when I first tried it 4 years ago. It comes in a convenient bottle, where you can control how much product you want. A little, truly goes a long way. Ive has a bottle last me over a year depending on how much makeup I need to take off. It smells fresh without a strong chemical or perfume scent. Lathers up quite well and rinses off easily. The best part is how it makes your face feel. Soft, clean and balanced! Non drying, no tight feeling and not oily. I’ve even had my daughter who breaks out use this cleanser and it’s made a difference. I can tell when she’s not using it. It calms her acne down."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,HANDS. DOWN. BEST. CLEANSER. EVER.,"This has cleared up my bumps from clogged pores and just given my skin an overall glow. I’m truly in love with this, and won’t ever use anything else. I didn’t think a cleanser would do so much for my skin but I was wrong."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,❤Holy Grail Product❤,"I have super sensitive, acne prone, oily skin.  Hormonal breakouts...you name it.  This product is amazing.  Yes, it's pricey, but comparable to a single facial.  A little goes a long way, and it consistently keeps my skin balanced."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,Absolutely love this cleanser. It’s lasts me a while so it feels like I get me $90 worth. This has been the face wash from my grandmother down to me. The family secret so clear skin!
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"I’m a lover of luxury products and La Mer is no exception. I had not tried La Mer cleansers until recently. 
I was hoping for the same results everyone was boasting about in previous reviews, but I have to stay I don’t notice a difference between this one and a drug store gel cleanser. I’ve been using it for almost 2 months now, and it does the cleaning job well, but nothing out of the ordinary. 
Also, the pump I find is a little too close inward so when you’re trying to get the product out you have to make sure your fingers are close.
Good heavy packaging, not ideal for travelling, but it looks pretty on the bathroom vanity.

I’d recommend it because it does the job, however if this is out of your budget, you’ll get the same results with a drug store gel cleanser."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"So I tried this cleansing gel and personally I don’t like it, I feel like my skin seems kind of dry even though it it clean’s well, I just still feel like it’s makes my skin stiff, I would not re-purchase this again, especially for the price."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,A MUST HAVE - BEST CLEANSER IN ALL OF SEPHORA,"I took advantage of the promotion and bought this cleanser - not expecting much - omg this is the best cleanser I’ve ever tried - I already repurchased 2 bottles to stock up. A small amount goes a long way, smells clean and refreshing as well as leaves your skin ready for the following steps. It’s a gel so obviously if you have normal or dry skin this is not for you. BUT for all combination and oily skin types this is a must have!!!!!!!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Gentle on skin and cleans my lash lextensions too!,"Best cleanser I've ever used. It kinda tastes like salt water, if you happen to get a smidge on your lips in the shower, and has a earthy natural scent.. But I love that I can also use it to wash my eye make off and it doesn't harm my lash extensions at all. I've used it for years now. Love it!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"La mer cleansers really cleans the skin. The gel is no exception. Squeaky clean feeling and using this every morning, the bottle lasts over a year. Always clams my skin."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Not Worth the Price Tag,Did not remove all of my makeup. Made my face feel so dry and tight. Not a fan of the smell or price tag.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Worthwhile and soothing,"While la mer at first seems pricy, only a little gel is needed per use making it a very worthwhile purchase. The smell of the sea is very soothing and it gently cleans and brightens the face; however, having sensitive skin I do not recommend using this more than once a day. Nonetheless, probably one of the best cleanser available on the market!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Helped correct dryness and breakouts,"I love this cleanser.  I use to have dry skin with the occasional breakout and this cleanser, help stop that.  This really gets all the oil, dirt and grime off your face.  I know the price in not ideal.  But this gets the job done."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,This product gets the job done. And a little goes a long way. Foams up really nice. A pea size is plenty. So you actually get more for your money when compared to other cleansers. I will say that this product is nothing special when compared to the rest of the La Mer line. I would save money by not buying this product and splurging on something else from this line.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,JADORE! Best Cleanser Ever,"Let me tell you... this cleaner is amazing. I have severe eczema that requires me to be on steroids to calm it. I can scrub my face 3 times, roughly in one wash with this and it NEVER irritates. Worth every penny! Plus it aided in ridding my skin of terrible acne! This replaced cetaphil which was the only cleanser I could use but I still broke out and had red irritated skin. I love this so happy I got a sample one days later I went back and bought the whole bottle. Lasts pretty well too. Only one pump. Suds like a dream!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Too expensive for what it is.,Nothing special.  I used this for about 4 months and I can't see any difference and there are far less expensive cleansers out there with better results.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Beware if you have sensitive skin,"I switched from the La Mer foam cleanser to this, big mistake. This in one day caused irritation, rosacea flare up and several bumps on my forehead. Not sure what the combination of ingredients is that causes these flare-ups. I have fallen in love with the La Mer cleansing foam; it heals, evens skin tone and calms."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,I love this product! It removes all traces of makeup and my skin feels so soft and fresh after!
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,My Favorite Cleanser,Hands down my favorite cleanser. Been using it for my combination rosacea prone skin for over 10 years now. You need a pea size (literally) amount to cleanse your face. The fragrance is very subtle and it low lathers perfectly. Due to the very small amount needed I can use one bottle for about 6 months.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,I'm OBSESSED!!!,"I so badly wanted to hate this product because of the price, $90 is SO expensive for face wash. It is however worth every bit of money I spent on it. I've only been using it a week and my skin is SO much softer and more radiant.  I look dewy without anything else on my skin. I'll justify the price based on the fact I won't be using anyrhing else from now on."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer face wash,Honestly it's a good face wash but I don't think it's worth buying it for that amount of money.  I think $90 for face a wash is expensive.  I just wanted to know what the hype was about. But I don't think I would buy it again I can buy a  cheaper face wash and still get the same result.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,My poor face,"Had very high hopes for this product seeing that it's $90, but after I washed my face this left my skin feeling SO. DRY. All my natural oils just completely stripped from my face. Can't say I'll be repurchasing :("
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,I wish it was more affordable,"Non drying, mild, easily washes off, face is not tight afterwards, soft scent, fresh and clean.  I wish it was more affordable. In my opinion the dupe for this is the Kale + Green Tea and Spinach is almost exactly like it :)"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Lasts forever and is not drying!,"Okay, so I have true combo skin. Has to be the worst! I have used this cleanser every morning with my Clarisonic (LM does have a Foaming Cleanser, but I found it left too much of a residue on my skin) for at least 5 years. This bottle is huge and even if you use the recommended two pumps it will last you forever! I used to use only 1 pump and thought holy smokes, will this thing ever run out?! What's amazing is that it seems to truly cleanse my skin, while leaving the moisture barrier intact. I've never felt my skin was dry or tight afterwards."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,love,My very first LA MER product ever. So glad I splurged and got this face wash! The scent is lovely and it leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft. I have oily and sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate me at all.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Sorry to say I've parted ways with my old Cleanser,"I have used Purity Cleanser by philosophy for many years. And in between would try and fail at finding anything else that would ever make me want to change until now. Three months and counting on this gel, and I'm in love. I'm 55 and wanted to try this. I got a deluxe sample, it goes along way. I use it on the sephora pink Face scrubby that has the little dots and lines on one end. And I seriously use less then a half a pea size on my face scrubby that I run under warm water first. If I'm removing makeup I do use the la Mer cleansing oil first then this gel. And found this combination so great that I don't feel the need to use anything else afterwards. I've been doing this for three months now and my skin has improved enough people are commenting on it. I also don't wear makeup all the time anymore. I do use the face perfecting cream by lamer daily and sometimes throw on my smashbox halo powder, lamer powder bronzer and lamer highlighter, and I'm good to go. Oh and lamer illuminating eye gel. I'm sold yes its expensive but soooo worth it."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Best cleanser ever,"Feels amazing, cleans amazing, just everything is perfect I love it. Tried many different cleansers but always come back to this one time and time again"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"Feel like I've tried everything, and this cleanser leaves my skin feeling absolutely amazing. So clean and smooth. A little goes a long way. Love it."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,finally La Mer at Sephora!!!,I have been using The Cleansing Gel for 2 years now and will never go back or use anything else.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Australia,SEB DERM GIRLS GET THIS,I am so happy that i finally found a cleanser that works both for my acne and seberohic dermatitis. I have struggled with seb derm for years but since i have started using this I don’t have flare ups any more. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Good gentle alternative to treat problem skin.,"I picked this cleanser up during a sale a couple of weeks ago and I can already see that it’s helping with my skin, particularly in the chin area. It’s really smooth and I just add a little water to helpnit spread a little better.spbetter. I have also left it for a few minutes like a quick mask and that has been refreshing as well￼"

I’ve tried SO MANY as a teenager, and I will never use another one besides this. It totally got rid of the little bumps on my forehead which were extremely stubborn. Buy it!!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,True Deep Cleanser,"I like this deep clay cleanser from First Aid Beauty. It can be a little drying but if it’s followed by a hydrating face cream like Ultra Hydrating Cream from First Aid, then it’s not as bad. I love the earthy scent and the way it deeply cleanses my face without stripping and irritating it. It does not leave my face tight or red. It helped me a lot with my acne problems and it moisturized while it cleansed."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Great deep cleanser,Great deep cleanser. This is the first time I have bought it and will buy it again.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,i’ve only been using this for a little bit but i have absolutely no complaints. i can feel my skin being cleansed w/o it being stripped. i use a combination of other fad products and they have worked so well together.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Singapore,1st time trying,Bought it for partner as he has very sensitive skin. so far his face is getting better. The product has gilttery and mild smell to it. will continue to buy this product. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,All time favorite facial cleanser!,"My go to face wash. Definitely keeps acne in check. I've tried other stuff but this one is my favorite and works the best...
I have minimal breakouts during ""that time of the month"" and this product is super gentle and my acne clears up fast."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Sorcery,"I never write reviews.  BUT, this is the only product I switched in my routine for the past month and my skin has never looked better.  Smooth, poreless, soft.  I am completely amazed.  Incredible what the right cleanser can do for your skin.  So happy!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Australia,One of my faves ,I use this cleanser on a rotating basis with their other cleanser and I love both. This cleanser has a more rough feel to it which leaves the skin feeling cleaner and tighter. The only thing I don't like about it is the smell but that goes away as soon as it's washed off your face so not a deal breaker for me. will continue to use and buy more when I need it. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,New Zealand,"Great cleanser, especially for acne prone skin! ","This is one of the rare cleansers that doesn’t break me out while actually cleansing my skin and leaving it feeling fresh, clear and soft! The ingredients are amazing and none are comedogenic, or will create a nice environment for fungal acne, which can be a nightmare… I’ve tried countless others and always come back to this one. I also had a really bad breakout recently after I ran out of this product and once I bought another tube and was able to use it again it helped a lot with the inflammation, redness and healing process. It’s also not too strong for daily use, although I do not have particularly sensitive skin. The only reason I don’t give it 5 stars is because it does not do much to reduce oiliness - I tend to have very oily skin so need to use a combination of products, this one alone wouldn’t make much of a difference. But overall an amazing product! "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Singapore,Amazing! ,This is amazing! My favourite cleanser of all time and i’m purchasing my 2nd bottle now! my face has been the clearest ever! initially i was a little skeptical even after reading the reviews. but this really works for me! and before this i was using dr dennis gross which was alright.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,DO NOT BUY,"Worst cleanser ever I regret to buy it, I used it for a week and every single day I woke up in the morning to see a new red hurting acne once I stopped it my face skin started to be clear gradually, there’s only acnes scar on my face which take longer time to disappear but no new acnes. If there’s zero star rate I’d go for it!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Won’t Purchase Again,"Was not happy with this product at all. Made me break out more, my skin was dry and really red. Wish they would bring back the red clay cleanser. Now that worked amazing!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,True Believer,I noticed an immediate difference in how oily my skin was plus I love that it doesn't leave my skin feeling dry at all. The instructions say to use 2x per day but once a day works well for me. I plan on buying more once I run out.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,AWESOME,"I rarely write reviews, but this cleanser is so underrated! I have been using this cleanser off and on for the past 4 years. I have sensitive, combo, somewhat acne prone skin. This cleanser is definitely one of my all time favs and I always come back to it."

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,holy grail,When buying this face wash I was skeptical as it claimed to be good for sensitive skin !!! And to my surprise it actually is it also combines very well with my oily skin and Does not cause any break out which is a major plus for me since everything breaks me out !!!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,NOPE,Awful. It burned my skin. I tried it 3 times just to make extra sure and it was just so awful. I would definitely never ever buy this again.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,works wonders for my oily/acne prone skin,"i have oily acne prone skin. although this cleanser isn't targeted towards acne, i have found it to cleanse my oily skin well without stripping it, then i use acne treatments for my acne. this does help a lot when it comes to maintaining clean skin. i have tried to switch over to other cleansers but always come back to this one. have been using this for almost two years. got my younger sister on this too!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Great product,"Really enjoy this product, been using it for 3 weeks or so and I’ve noticed a change in my skin. Doesn’t irritated my skin, love this product."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Great cleanser but use it quickly,I love this cleanser! It’s great for my oily acne prone skin. I only use it at night after an oil cleanse. Nothing really makes my skin feel as clean but not stripped. My only complaint is that the smell turns pretty quickly. Be sure to use this within a couple of months and don’t have many cleansers on the go. If I don’t use this us in two months my cleanser ends up smelling like cheese!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Feeling fresh,Super great for removing all makeup/dirt/oils that have built up throughout the day. Prevents from overnight breakouts!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Not Amazing But Does Work,This does a decent job. It did stop my breakouts however it didn't really feel like it cleansed my skin. The smell of the clay was not great but got used to it.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,"No matter how many new face washers I try, I always come back to this one."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Go To Cleanser.,My go to cleanser. Works great on my skin which can be reactive at times. The only thing is that I wish it had a better top on it; dropped it once and it cracked which led to some product leaking out.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Malaysia,pores look cleaner,"it's good, paired together with glow recipe cleansing balm, it works great and really clears out the pores. the consistency is quite liquidy, so make sure to keep the bottle the other way up to prevent spillagw"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Australia,Great When Removing Make Up,I use this after I use a cleansing balm for my double cleanse routine. I don't use this on the daily because I found it left me more dry/dehydrated over time. Using it my double cleanse though helps ensure no risk of breakout from remaining make up. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Australia,cement in a bottle ,"I love this, thick awesome exfoliate absolutely will buy again, wish the packaging was biodegradable tho I buy quite a few things at Sephora and I feel like there is far too much plastic "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Australia,it’s okay ,"Haven’t seen any difference in my skin yet however I do enjoy this cleanser, it comes out red with shimmer and lathers white on your face so don’t be afraid of it staining, it won’t "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,go-to daily cleanser,I’ve been using this for a little over a year now as my primary facial cleanser and it is my absolute go-to. I have a weak skin barrier so it’s super important for me to ensure that my I have a cleanser that can dive deep into my pores.  It has decreased my overall breakouts. I prefer products that aren’t scented but this one isn’t too bad.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,helps me avoid breakouts,Tried switching cause I got bored and my skin is staring to age. Bad idea. This face wash has consistently kept me break out free for years. I wear make up daily and my breakouts are more about clogged pores than anything else. My only reason for a 4 instead of a 5 is that it doesn’t remove makeup but at least it’s not harsh on myskin.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Amazing!,I love this face wash. I have combination skin with big pores and my face has been feeling so clean since I switched to this.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Holy grail!! I have fungal acne and this has saved my skin
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Love!,Absolutely love this product. Super gentle and does wonders for acne-prone skin!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Not worth it,"This cleanser did nothing for my skin. Wanted a cleanser that would deep clean my pores and help with acne caused  by wearing a mask. I’ve used it for around two months now to give my skin the time to adjust to it, and there has been no change. The cleanser aggravates my acne more than helps it.
The packaging was also an issue, couldn’t leave the bottle standing up with out the cleanser leaking out of the bottle"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Great daily foaming cleanser,"Excellent cleanser. I breakout easily so I really need to use a foaming cleanser. My skin tends towards oily, but can get dry easily too. I use this every morning with my clarisonic facial brush (which is far superior to the other Faro sonication brush). I buy 10 of these at a time so I always have one on the shelf. My brother started using it too. Clearly he has good taste."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,WORTH EVERY PENNY,"I’ve been testing out a few cleaners lately, didn’t mind the First Aid Beauty original cleanser but this one I notice the difference in my skin looking significantly less oily!! It’s a dream"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,AMAZING soo gentle and hydrating. I’ve tried soo many cleansers and this one has by far been the best :)
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Useless,I used it for months and did nothing for me. The formula is very guppy and it spills easily out the bottle if you leave it standing up. Its kinda messy and the clay does nothing. Im going to try something else. I wish I could return it.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Amazing!,"I have sensitive skin and the minimal ingredients have caused no breakouts. I've been using this as a second step cleanser in conjunction with albalene. I love the way it leaves my face feeling. It's an amazing product and the price point is just great, I will warn you that you either love the scent of the product or not. I happen to love it."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Its fine for a simple cleanser.,"This was ok. If your a kid or a man who has problems submitting to a diligent skincare routine and all you need is simple a cleanser for you shower then you should be happy. I liked the smell -spa-ish, not floral or fruity."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,"Love this cleanser, it has truly helped minimize my breakouts and I can tell, because when I’m lazy and don’t wash my face with it for two days I break out a lot. 

The consistency is amazing, it’s very gel like and easy to use."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,not the best out there,"nothing super special! i have super oily and acne prone skin, didn’t stop shine or prevent new pimples so i probably won’t repurchase:( also the way it’s formatted makes it leak quite often"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Didn’t notice 1 difference after 6+ months of use,"While I’m a fan of the brand, this particular cleanser didn’t ever flush out my pores or make my skin feel nearly as clean as their other incredible cleanser, the Pure Skin Cleanser. This one with red clay unfortunately did not unclog my pores, it more so just helped wash my face, which just about any cleanser really can do. I highly recommend their other cleanser as mentioned before, for a really clean, fresh-faced feel. Cant go wrong with that one."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,"This is my go-to cleanser. I still have acne, and this helps lessen my breakouts without being harsh."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,"I have combination skin and this is the best cleanser I have found that helps combat the oiliness in my t-zone and occasional dry patches on my cheeks. There is decent amount of product that comes in the tube, washing my face twice a day it usually lasts two months"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,great face wash to remove makeup,"Great face wash! I have combination skin & at 44 started to see enlarging pores.  I’ve tried other face washes with AHA & other ingredients for exfoliating, but didn’t see much of a difference.  I only use this one at night, and over the last 2-3 weeks, I can see a change.  It leaves my skins clean without feeling stripped. Will definitely continue to use & but again."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Fast Acting,"I have sensitive, combination skin that is prone breakouts. I have been using this for half a week now and I was in the middle of a bad breakout, it completely stopped the breakout from getting worse and is helping to reduce the inflammation. I am now pairing this product with the bha spot treatment and am very optimistic for the outcome. 

It is slightly drying just make sure that you are using a moisturizer with it and you will be good! I also live in a very dry city."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,"Love this product, I’ve bought it 3 times now! I find it gets rid of break outs faster and reduces redness from them. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because it didn’t do much for blackheads like it said it would on the FAB website. Still a great product though and I’ll keep repurchasing it!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,I was so disappointed!! This cleanser did not lather. My skin did not feel clean after using it. I will be retiring it!!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Cleared up my acne prone skin. I Highly recommend.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Maybe?,"I really wish this product worked better. It did lessen my acne, but I still aways have clusters of zits all over. The most noticeable thing that wasn’t exactly desirable is that it made my zits “more compact” for a lack of a better term, and therefore more painful"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,"I switched to this recently. This stuff is amazing!! A very little goes a long way, so I can see the tube lasting a long time, and you easily get a really good lather with it. I use it twice a day with Origins' Clear Improvement moisturizer and it's definitely helped to manage my oiliness, and my pores, and get a nasty acne breakout back under control."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Great for sensitive oily/combo skin,"Love this cleanser! It’s perfect for my oily T zone.  Since I started using it my skin looks better.  It doesn’t dry my skin, my pores look smaller, no more acne due to clogged pores.  I have tried so many cleansers on my sensitive skin and by far this one is the best."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,really nice cleanser,"I absolutely love this cleanser. I have very oily skin with lots of pores that need to be cleaned daily and this does all that and more! I've tried so many cleansers and this one has been the best so far. I love that it has clean ingredients and it leaves my skin smooth and clean, and doesn't strip it down. Will be restocking when I'm out."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,"Great for young skin, and mature skin.","Love this cleanser! I am 50, and have combination skin. This cleanser is perfect. It blasts through oil and makeup without being too drying. You do not need to use a lot, and it works really well. I also have very sensitive skin, and this did not cause a reaction. I gave some to my 20 yr old daughter, she loves it as well. Suitable for younger skin as well as mature skin."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,"Gel consistency takes a bit to lather, but spreads well and cleans the face. Doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. It doesn’t quite clear my blemishes though, like I thought it would. But overall, it’s not bad."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,love this,great face cleanser for clearing up problem skin-daughter uses it too
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,good stuff,It seems to be working really well and doing what it says it’ll do
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,The best cleanser,"I’ve gone through so many expensive cleansers, and always end up back to this one. It is the OG cleanser, the best for combination/oily skin. Cleanses so well yet still gentle, doesn’t leave that awful squeaky post soap feeling on your face, keeps breaks out under control."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,This is the most amazing product if you have large pores. My pores are so big they almost look like pin pricks all over my face and this product seriously has made them smaller. It is the only thing that has ever helped. If you have big pores seriously try this.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,holy grail,"i’ve been using this cleanser for a few months and i love it so much. i just repurchased my second bottle. it smells good, foams up well, and does a great job of keeping my skin clear and clean!! i have oily, acne prone skin and this doesn’t make me break out at all. it’s taken me so long to find a holy grail cleanser but i’ve finally found it! definitely recommend!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,BEST cleanser ever,I absolutely LOVE this cleanser. I’ve tried so many different cleansers in the past few years from $20-100+ and this one takes the cake. The price itself is a huge selling point and the amount of product you need per usage is very minimal. One bottle will last a few months. It gets deep into the skin and does it job! I’ve never used a better cleaner. Highly recommend!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Not for me personally,"This one was a big NO for me. I waited to write a review until I used the whole bottle. First, never drop this product... I did on accident and the whole cap broke in half and it’s such a smooth cleanser it was pouring out. I do feel like it didn’t clean out my pours. I broke out. I was using two other cleansers before I used this one and it was just not cleaning anything left over. I also used the moisturizer from this brand and it probably made me break out too. I feel like this cleanser is very gentle. I do feel like the red clay provided a little glow but nothing dramatically different.  Not a huge scent at all did notice in the product it was sparkly. Personally I didn’t like that. It was red for those wondering. Sometimes I felt the oil still on my face which made me use more than two cleansers just to make sure. In the end I still felt like I had a layer of dirt on my face. I hated wearing makeup and using this product cause I just felt like it didn’t help at all. I would think no makeup and this cleanser would be better. But This is my personal opinion I tried it because of the red clay and it did little to nothing the brightness in your skin fades two hours after you wash your face. Honestly if you want to try it go for it my skin is completely different (combination, dry around nostrils, eyes, cheeks, and , oily t-zone).  I would recommend this to some that’s more dry in skin and doesn’t break out. But I’m it a dermatologist so... try it out if you like it I’m happy it works for someone. It just didn’t for me. Hope this helped!:)"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Decent cleanser,Bought it to reduce the appearance of pores but I havent seen much changes. But I still like it as a cleanser.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Not a Fan,"I’m not sure I would ever get this for anyone.. it feels great once it’s rinsed off for sure, BUT I guess it’s the red clay that it this weird liquid rubber texture? Not entirely sure if it’s done anything for my skin bc I don’t feel like it’s done anything like the Black Charcoal cleanser <- WHICH I LOVE!!! But I wouldn’t get this again it feels EXACTLY like the face mask which also has the Red Clay in it."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Works wonders for me!,"I have been using this for about a week and have already noticed improvements in my skin! I have been a First Aid Beauty user for almost two years and have been yet to be let down. This product was the extra little push my skin needed and has been helping to clear up areas of my face I’ve been struggling with for years. This will definitely be a go to from now on. My skin has a tendency of drying out especially with products suggested for acne, I haven’t noticed any dryness and am so happy with the results!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,love!!,i lovvveeeee this product!! it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin in the slightest bit and it keeps my oiliness and acne away all day long. i use this morning and night and my skin has never looked better!! only been using it for a few weeks but as of right now 5 stars!!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Somewhat washes off makeup and leaves my skin super super dry. My skin is naturally prone to being more dry and this product makes it so much worse.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,We are LOVING it!,"I actually purchased this for my boyfriend. He has an oily T-zone, and breaks out like a mad man when stressed out. Mainly around his jaw line area. He has been using this and OMG! His skin is glowing! Yes, he still breaks out, but not as bad! Maybe a third the amount as before. I will make him keep using this for a while and see where it goes!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Horrible!! Made me break out in the weirdest places that I’ve never had issues with
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Yep Yep Yep,"I have and will continue to repurchase this product. I am a fan of most First Aid Beauty products, but this one is by far my favorite. It have supremely sensitive skin and have to be VERY careful about the products I introduce, as I risk flaring up acne or eczema or redness or... the list goes on. This product is both gentle and powerful! It removes dirt and grime, targeting pores, all the while keeping your skin integrity intact - leaving you with clean, soft, rebounding skin rather than that tight and dry feeling a lot of clay cleansers cause. A little goes a long way, so this product lasts a while which makes the price point worth it for me. I recommend this to everyone!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,I bought this cleanser around a month back. I like the formulation and it did work for my skin however the tube is almost half done and for the price I bought it at it's not the best. I was expecting so much more from first aid beauty since everyone kept raving about it. I don't think I'd be buying the product again.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Mica Powder,I would give this a higher review but I was very disappointed to find that it contained mica and was mildly glittery. This didn’t stay on my skin and the cleanser did as intended but mica powder in a cleanser is a completely unnecessary ingredient and really cheapens the product. I have no idea why the decision to add mica to the product was made as it isn’t a makeup item. The cleanser did feel really good and gave my skin a needed deep clean to remove built up makeup and other skincare products. You can kinda see the sheen of the mica powder in the photo I gave but it’s much more evident in person.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Great for all skin types,One of the Sephora employees recommended this to me while I was shopping and I am so happy she did! I use this every other day and it helps control my breakouts. Great for sensitive skin too!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Good... Not Great.,Product was definitely worth the price. Really disliked the scent but was super happy knowing I was using a clean product. It seemed to help with my acne at first (I used the Red Clay Exfoliant Pads as well). After using the product for a while I found that it didn’t have the same effects long term. Been using since January and it’s not May. Still have some product left and I use it 2 times daily. Definitely a good amount of product for what you’re paying. Would potentially buy again but looking to try new things to see what works for me.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Clears my acne in 2 days,This along with the salicylic pads clear up my acne in 2 days. Along with the ordinary alpha arbutin to tackle scaring before it can happen.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,meh,"First aid beauty is hit or miss for me, and this cleanser just wasn’t it. My skin definitely purged at the start of use, a lot of congestion and papules. It calmed down after some consistent use but I wouldn’t call it a holy grail product. For the price, you can do much better in my opinion"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Great value for sensitive skin,"This is my go-to facewash for getting all the dirt and grime without overdrying or irritating. I got turned onto FAB when my skin was super sensitive during pregnancy. I highly recommend this line for sensitive skin. They are all a good value, too. Good price and it lasts a long time."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,This gel cleanser really does the job and does a deep clean of my skin. I have combination skin which I do not take care of often. This cleanser really tugs out the dirt and leaves my skin feeling clean without being abrasive.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,buy this,Best face wash I won’t ever go back. Cleans your skin nicely without drying out your face. Cleared up my skin concerns right away
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Great for Oily Skin,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I've been using this cleanser for over 5 years and I still love it! I have very oily skin, and this cleaner usually gets rid of all that oil and dirt in one wash without stripping my skin."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,If Supreme Made A Red Cleanser,Cleans like no other! Cleared my poor congested pores after one use. It keeps getting better.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,The formulation of this cleanser is odd. It’s thick and sort of gel like but it never gets foamy or creamy. You put it on your face and it just kind of feels like lube. Also a little hard to wash off. Haven’t noticed any huge changes in my skin either. Won’t re purchase.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,"Works great, but not a miracle product","Very good cleanser for oily or acne prone skin, and at a great price point compared to a lot of the other comparable moisturizers. Not a miracle product but works for keeping my acne at bay with the exception or stubborn hormonal acne. Will continue to purchase."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Worth It,My face feels softer after I used it. My acne definitely starts to heal faster after using this product compared to previous products that I used before. I just purchased another one!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Live changer,I have sensitive acne prone oily skin and this cleanser is the most perfect for my skin! It has significantly improved my skin in 2 weeks and i’ve never been so happy with a cleanser! I’ve really noticed a change in my skin. This doesn’t dry my skin out at all and doesn’t leave my skin feeling stripped!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Best thing ever.,LOVE THIS CLEANSER. I love this so much the texture is great and I use it everyday
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Love it !!,At first I thought it was just a normal cleanser that didn’t do much but after a while I noticed my blemishes reducing and it leaves my skin so soft. I have combination skin and prone to breakouts but as long as you use it everyday you should see results!! I’m running out and will buy a new one.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Not for me,"It may have just been how this cleanser worked on my skin (as there are so many positive reviews), but I did not get a deep cleanse and it left something of a film after I rinsed it off. I ended up breaking out on my forehead (where I never really break out) and my blackheads got worse. Would not recommend to someone in a humid climate or acneic skin."
MALIN + GOETZ-Facial Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Cleans well,My first purchase of cleansing oil from the brand and I really am impressed ! It has an uplifting spa-like scent from its blends of different oil bases and rinses very well with water. I can even skip my cleansing foam which I regularly had to use as second step from using another premium brand. Would surely re purchase.
VOTARY-Cleansing Oil - Rose Geranium And Apricot,Australia,Part of my daily for as long as they make it,Cleans and moisturises really well. I apply to wet skin and after massaging for a bit I leave it then use a toner to remove any residue. It’s lightweight and smells lovely. A little goes a long way for my skin which is pretty balanced. Don’t get breakouts. Skin quality improved since staying this product
VOTARY-Cleansing Oil - Rose Geranium And Apricot,Malaysia,awful,"i dont get the rave reviews. this thing barely removes makeup, it stings the eyes and causes breakouts. considering how expensive it is, i would much rather use regular coconut oil since the efficacy is the same. better off using clinique take the day off or tatcha make up remover"
VOTARY-Cleansing Oil - Rose Geranium And Apricot,Singapore,great product,Helped my friend buy this. It was her first time trying this product. She’s been wanting to try it - And she loves it a lot. It cleanses make up really well and smells great. 
VOTARY-Cleansing Oil - Rose Geranium And Apricot,Australia,Love Love Love it!!!!,Smells divine!!!! This oil cleanser has been my saving grace during these winter months. Easily washes off and leaves no tightness in my skin like most cleansers that I have used that are apparently suitable to dry/very dry skin. Highly recommend!!!!
VOTARY-Cleansing Oil - Rose Geranium And Apricot,Australia,Wow,"After using this product, I realized why Votary cleansing oils are the cult hit. It smells so good and cleans so well without drying. I use it with either Votary terry cloth or the Eve Lom muslin cloth (for a deeper cleanse or to remove makeup) and it gives an almost glass like sheen. It is also perfect for sensitive skin. I pair it with the Votary super seed cream which is also a great product. Not cheap but it's worth every cent.      "
VOTARY-Cleansing Oil - Rose Geranium And Apricot,,Best Cleansing Oil,I love this cleansing oil. it smells divine. It does an excellent job at braking down makeup. It also can be used as a morning cleanser. The face cloth that comes with it is super soft on the skin. It's the best towel ever. 
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Australia,My New Favourite Facewash ,I am loving using this product. A little goes a long way and it suds up but has a milky like texture. It’s very hydrating yet refreshing even in summer. 
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,worth the money ,"I must say, for its price point, it's awesome. It doesn't strip the skin of moisture, yet the skin feels clean and well prepped for moisturizer to glide on. "
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"This is a nice gentle cleanser, it foams up to be quite soft and fluffy. Slightly citrus scented and reminds me of lemon meringue pie."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Malaysia,A little goes a long way,Giving this more than 5 stars if I could. I finished a tube within 7 months! A little bit goes a very long way because you will need a little bit to foam a lot. Definitely one of the best face wash I have ever used. 
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Bar Soap,Smells and feels exactly like bar soap in cleanser form. Not a fan.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Best cleanser,It cleans really well without drying or stripping the skin
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,one of the best,Been using it for more than 9 months now. Best purchase ever. Helped clear my adult acne and stopped them from coming back. And I have very dry skin.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Effective Anti-Aging Cream Cleanser,"This is a great cream cleanser which I highly recommend for dry aging skin and maybe even acceptable for sensitive skin types as it is gentle and comforting as advertised. It has a light fruity scent which may not be agreeable to everyone, regardless I will most likely be repurchasing as every other cleanser I’ve used pales in comparison to the effectiveness of this one."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,hello bar soap!???,"At some point I stopped washing and asked my boyfriend why it smelled like I was using his body bar soap on my face. After washing off the first area, I immediately regretted this purchase. I may as well have been using bar soap .. the scent is a little overwhelming. Some other individuals say they experienced the same thing but that they swear by this cleanser so I’m willing (I suppose) to use it for a few days / weeks to see if I notice the same changes. I really don’t enjoy feeling like my skin is stripped completely, but with the right serum / moisturizer combo, this would definitely be doable. But not for this price."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,very gentle,This cleanser is very gentle and effective at removing the days dirt.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Game changer,"I love this cleanser SO much. When I first started using it, I did notice that my skin would feel super tight immediately after washing but the longterm impact has been incredible. I actually have to exfoliate half as much as I used to, and my skin texture overall is softer and smoother than it's ever been. I highly recommend, especially if you suffer from small bumps or uneven texture."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Breakout Central!!!!!,Initially when I used this I thought it smelled really good and felt smoothing. I wanted to switch up my cleanser. I found this one made me breakout really bad! I never really had acne besides a few pimples here and there until I started using this. I have pretty dry skin and I think this dried my skin out!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"It claims to not overstrip the skin of its oils, but when I tried it I was way too squeaky clean... nice foaming action though!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,I’d probably give it a 3.5 if I could,"Loves:
- The scent. I am a big fan of delicious scents with my skin care. This one has a distinct citrus scent, strong enough I smell it every time but not so strong that my whole bathroom has the scent or that it stays on my skin after rinsing. 
- The formula feel while washing. I love that just a pea sized amount turns into a luxurious foamy feeling cleanser. I feel clean. 
- Packaging. It’s simple, cute, and I like squeezing tubes that make me feel like I’m getting all the product. 
-Price. Not too expensive and a lot of product. 

Dislikes:
- Drying. As others have mentioned, this leaves a tightness to my skin. It’s not the worst for me but I do not he it some days. 

Overall: don’t know yet if I would repurchase. I’m eager to see if my summer skin likes it more with all the humidity and my sweating and excess sunscreen. May bump it to a 4 if I like it as a seasonal cleanser."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Very drying,Overall this wash is too drying. I have combination skin and would noticed my skin would feel stripped and tight after washing. You will definitely need a good moisturizer after this wash. Might be better for those with very oily skin.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"This cleanser is my holy grail!!!! My skin is glowing and that says a lot considering how extremely sensitive it is. This cleanser makes my skin feel so clean and silky, like never before. I absolutely love it! And the smell is subtle but so good! I recently tried a different brand, just once and immediately switched back to Saturday Skin, it’s just amazing how it makes my skin feel and look."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Felt like bar soap,This does not feel moisturizing at all. It felt the same as using bar soap for my face for my combination skin. This is probably better for someone with oily skin and needs stripping of face oil.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Great for my acne prone skin,"Love this cleanser!  I’ve been searching for a new cleanser that doesn’t break me out, or leave me feeling too dry. This one is perfect.  I used Bobbie Brown’s tube cleanser for years, but it was discontinued and I’ve tried no less than 10 others before I landed on this one. Highly recommend it, I like natural oils in my face cleansers (jojoba, avocado, etc...). No need for a makeup remover with this either. I cleanse twice and I’m set."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"This is probably better for oily skin. I have dry skin, and felt like it stripped my skin and left it feeling too “squeaky clean”. I wasn’t a huge fan of the scent. A little goes a long way, and the texture is really nice! I wished it had worked for me. I don’t hate it, but it’s just not the best fit for what I need."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Works Nice but Strong Smell,"This is a nice, creamy cleanser that does a good job cleansing my face without stripping my skin. However, it has a very strong citrusy smell. It almost smells like house cleaner. If you can get pass the scent, nice solid cleanser."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Horrible cleanser,If I could give this product zero stars I would !!! It made my skin have the worse breakout I’ve ever had !!!!! Horrible and it made my skin so dry I do not recommend this!! Save your money
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,The hype is real!,"I own large sizes of primers and certainly doesn’t need more, but was curious about this and bought the sample size.  Been using a few times so far but really love it!  Makes my makeup look so much better and lasts a good long time.  The scent doesn’ bother me at all considering  most scents give me a headache.  This doubles as moisturizer and primer and has caused no issues with my sensitive skin.  Glad I gave it a try"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,I didn’t care for the scent of this product and found it to be drying for me.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"I haven't quite decided about this product. I like it, but there's a ""but"" in there that I can't quite define. Give it a try."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Disappointed,I wanted to love this cleanser but it makes me break out everytime I use it
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Best cleanser for dry skin EVER!,Gifted by Saturday Skin for my honest review. I have dry skin and this is like the perfect cleanser for me! The texture is so nice and it’s almost hydrating. My skin doesn’t feel tight and dry after using this. I’ve been using this as both my morning and nighttime cleanser and this is helping to save my skin especially during these cold winter months when my skin is usually so dry it’s unbearable! I’ve also noticed my skin looks a little brighter after using not as dull. If you have dry skin like mine I definitely recommend you checking out this cleanser!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,A pass for me.,"The Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser was gifted by Saturday Skin and I was so excited to try it. Unfortunately, it did not work well for me at all. I thought the package design, the scent, and the fact it’s a cream cleanser was great but that’s all the pros for me. Upon opening, my package did take a little effort to squeeze out, multiple times, as for the product itself, I did not enjoy it.  There must be an ingredient in this product that doesn’t agree with me because it left red, irritation marks on my cheeks as well as my skin felt very dry & uncomfortable after using it. I cannot recommend this product based on my bad experience."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Way too drying!!,I bought this a WHILE ago and I finally used the entire bottle up ( only because it was too expensive to just throw away ) it has good reviews but definitely drys my skin out like nothing other. I generally have dry skin and this california tap water makes it worse! this cleanser didn't make my skin feel clean or soft and actually broke me out a bit! I'm glad it's gone and I can finally replace it with something else. if you have dry skin definitely stay away!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Amazing!,I received this product complimentary from Saturday Skin for testing and reviewing purposes. This cleanser is so amazing! I have very sensitive skin and it works perfectly for me! Might be my new favorite cleanser now!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Nice cushiony cleanser,"Gifted by Saturday skin for review. I loved the cushiony foam, it felt very soothing on my currently parched skin. Not stripping at all. A little bit goes a long way. I used a dime sized amount but even a pea sized amount would work great! Loved this cleanser"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Nice!,"I received Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser complimentary from Saturday skin in exchange for my honest review.

This cleanser has light citrus scent, nice texture and leaves skin feeling ultra clean. It doesn't dry my skin out. I haven't noticed any irritations as well."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,AMAZING!,"This cleanser was gifted by Saturday skin. First of all, I love the consistency of this cleanser, so foamy, gentle rich and smells amazing. Feels very nice on the skin, I feel like it’s so delicate and yet so effective! It takes so little product, which is great.  I had heavy make up on my face and this cleanser delicately removed it. Doesn’t dry the skin out and leaves the skin so smooth and fresh. I love it. Second of all, the design is gorgeous:simple and cute! Very girly. Overall, I’d recommend it!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,Highly recommended,Love this product so much.  This cleanser cleans my skin thoughly without drying the skin. Am into my third tube. Highly recommended.  Tempted to try the other products in the same range. 
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Loved!,"After only a week I can tell a difference! My pores look smaller, my skin is glowing and feels so soft. I have combo skin/ more on the dryer side so I was a little worried looking at the other reviews. But it does not feel drying at all to me. I follow it up with some serums and moisturizer though. I also love how much it lathers up, you only need a VERY little amount. Love it! Will definitely be buying again."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"This product dried my skin out irritated it and caused me to break out. It is a very harsh cleanser I agree with the other reviews that would be more beneficial for someone with very oily skin. Very disappointed. The name is extremely misleading, it is in no way a gentle cleanser. It actually made my skin have a burning sensation when I used it. Do not buy if you have even slightly dry or sensitive skin"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,phenomenal,"this is the best cleanser after using an oil cleanser. im obsessed with this. seriously tho, a dot does the trick. a little goes a loooooooong way!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,awesome for hormonal acne!,"Works well on my acne prone skin.  I haven’t gotten any more hormonal acne bumps since using this cleanser. Leaves my skin super soft, cleansed and not overly dry.  I will definitely be re-ordering."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"A little goes a long way! New favorite; love using it with the scrub, too."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,leaves a film,"Really wanted to like this cleanser but it left a film feeling on my skin after using every time. Didn’t feel clean, pretty uncomfortable"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,wax wash,I HATE this cleanser and am so disappointed. It has a great lather but the second I rinse it off my face feels like I rubbed candle wax all over it. Does not remove all traces of my makeup.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Love this cleanser. It’s so gentle and a little goes a long way. I really like the smell and I haven’t found it to be stripping unless I use too much product.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Only a wee bit needed,"This is a skin cleaner. Your face is clean to the point of almost feeling stripped of oils. You will definitely feel clean, however you will need to replenish with serums and moisture cream."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Don't understand the hype. Very average product.,"Don't understand the hype. There is literally nothing great about this cleanser, it is very average as to any cheap products you find at drug stores. More similar to Innisfree products which cost a fraction of the price but literally are the same."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,don’t recommend it,I honestly didn’t like it. I used to use Estèe lauder I regret that I changed it when I saw a lot of good reviews on this product. it irritated my skin and I had skin break out .
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Strips skin. Skin was so dry after. Gets make up off only ok. Lasts long
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"This is a good cleanser for someone with combo skin as it does give a refreshing, clean feeling. It is a bit stripping though so this isn’t something I reach for daily. There is also a scent as fragrance is really high on the ingredient list."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Huge Fan,My skin is finicky and doesn't tend to like most cleansers. This cleanser is refreshing and my skin loves it! I’m 100% loyal to this cleanser and highly recommend this!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,ehh,"The packaging is pretty, the product is gentle, BUT there is fragrance and it is not a necessity. There are way better, more effective, and cheaper cleansers out there!!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Singapore,Mdm ,"I have tried many other brands , some left with greasiness , some caused dryness ... Saturday Rise + Shine gentle cleanser is the best ! Even used during my harsh weather Oversea trips ... it never fails me at all ! Felt so clean each wash !  "
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"Harshly strips skin and makes it feel tight, would only recommend to someone that had very oily skin."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"While I like how nicely it cleansed my face, I don’t like the fact that citrus essential oils are so high up in the ingredient list. They are too irritating and sensitizing even in a wash off form, and this high up of concentration can really cause long term damage."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Do NOT buy!!!!,This product strips your skin terribly. It gives you that squeeky clean feeling that you can’t feel any moisture left in your skin. I tried to enjoy it but I will be attempting to return when stores are open. Waste of money.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Gets it ALL!,"I bought this cleanser due to someone elses review of how much it really cleans the face, and gets all the makeup. I don't wear a ton of make up anyway because I'm pretty prone to break outs. 
I started using this maybe a week ago and OH MY GOSH, the other person was RIGHT!  My skin looked SO fresh and so clean. Even my blemishes were a little lighter. Less than a dime size amount will get be plenty. Its thick and lathers nicely. I highly recommend this, and will be purchasing again.  (And the pore clarifying toner, and the water fall glacier cream )"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,So gentle and cleansing! On my second bottle. Bought based on the reviews and it did not disappoint.

SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,More like a cute packaging trap.,Makes a soapy foam like that does not feel gentle. Cleans but not leaves the fresh sensation. Not impressed.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"I’m confused why some people say that this product smells amazing, to me it doesn’t really have any scent and it is kind of liquidy, not what the picture shows. But overall it’s okay, I’m not very impressed by it but I certainly don’t hate it either."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"I have dry and sensitive skin, it makes your skin squeaky clean. But dries too much, and doesn't help with improving skin texture. I really wanted to love this, I kept using it, but after 2 months of trying to love it I gave up on it. :("
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Stripped skin badly,"This product was the beginning of the end for my skin.

I got a sample of this from a sephora employee after telling them I have sensitive skin and it stripped my skin so bad it felt tight and dry. 

I looked at the ingredients and VERY high on the list is lemon essential oil and a bunch of other citrus oils. I freaking wish companies would stop using essential oils improperly. Especially citrus oils are very exfoliating to the skin and should only be used in low dilution.

This product contributed to my skin getting over processed and I do not recommend."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Not for me,"I wanted to love this stuff I really gave it a try but it's too harsh on my face, strips it of everything, made me have severe dry patches, I see it has a ton of good reviews so it might be better for people with oily skin, it smells really nice too like lemons, but yeah it just didn't work good for my skin unfortunately"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,My new favorite skincare brand!,"This, ladies and gents, is the holy grail of cleansers!! I've tried A TON, and this one is simply the best. You don't need a lot, honestly, half a dime of product will clean your entire face and neck, and it produces wonderful silky foam. I've bought 2 so far, one for my apartment, and one for my boyfriend's. Trust me, try it and you will not be disappointed!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Foams Up So Nice!!,Very foamy. Really makes me feel I’m getting a great face wash. Smells good. I use a make up brush and apply the face wash. Smells good and I love that it’s a clean product!!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,not for dry skin,This cleanser is so good at removing makeup and oil. But I have dry skin and it leaves me with that tight feeling.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,WANTED TO LOVE THIS,"But unfortunately this product was not effective for my skin. I have very dry skin that I dehydrate more by drinking coffee in the morning and wine at night. Lol

This wash is sooooo soft and creamy, smells amazing and has helped keep my skin clear of congestion and break outs. HOWEVER, it leaves my face and neck SQUEEEEEEAKY clean. I find that I have to really lather on moisturizer to balance out everything that was washed away. I think this might be great for oily skin. But my face does not like it. I’m still so flakey in some spots."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Amazing and unique cleanser,"I love this cleanser! By far my favorite brand. A little bit goes a long way and the texture is so silky and soft. I’ve never felt a texture like it and it’s amazing. My skin feels so soft and clean afterwards. My skin has never looked better, Saturday Skin has been a lifesaver!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,This is a great basic cleanser. I use topical tretinoin and clindamycin and I had to irritation or side effects!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Not suitable for dry skin,"I have dry sensitive skin，and this cleanser is gentle didn't make my skin itch, cleans pretty well, but makes my skin very dry like the Sahara desert... Strips the moisture out of my skin."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,one of my favorites,"I have repurchased this cleaner at least four times and love it! For me it removes every trace of makeup and leaves my face super clean. I switched to this cleanser because I have hormonal acne, since using I have not had 1 breakout and my skin is clear. The only issue is that it’s drying, I use a rich moisturizer after so no dry patches or uncomfortable tightness. My skin type is combination and sensitive. It lasts a long time because you only need a pea sized amount for a rich lather. I would try a sample first for dry, sensitive skin because it may be too harsh for this skin type."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,strips skin,"The texture and scent are great, but sadly that’s about it. This cleanser really strips your skin and leaves mine feeling very tight and “squeaky clean” which isn’t supposed to happen. Disappointed :("
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Terrible for sensitive skin,"Not sure why Sephora did not approve my last review but I figured if I’d try again.  This product was absolutely terrible for my eczema prone/sensitive skin.  I should’ve paid attention to the ingredients list rather than trusting the “clean” stamp label.  There are a lot of very abrasive essential oils that severely dried out my skin, giving me the worst eczema flare up I’ve ever had.  I only used this product about 2-3 times per week and after a balm remover that I’ve been using for years.  I hope this review goes through to save others with sensitive skin from the pain."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Not for me,Love the creamy texture and smell. Like soft lemon. But I felt it didn’t take makeup off and left a weird film on my skin
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,It’s a nice cleanser. It is a little thick which isn’t my favorite but works nicely.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"My holy grail! This is my favorite cleanser. I will occasionally switch to another face cleanser to mix it up and see if I like something better, but I always regret it and go back to this one. My combo skin thanks me for it when I go back to it. It is such a clean, fresh feeling. Doesn't leave a funny residue on my skin and I have noticed a positive difference in my pores being smaller and less oil production in my TZone."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Love!,"So far so good.  I've been using it for about 2 weeks.  I have combination skin, a little oily in tzone and normal in other areas.  I use this with my clarisonic.  My first impression was that it didnt feel as if it was cleaning my skin, but once I rinsed it off and dried my face,  my skin felt so clean.  Hours later my skin still looked so fresh and the only areas looked less oily.  It's the first time I purchase this cleanser and I'm very happy with it.  I like to switch them up often and I use a pre cleanse before I use this cleanser.  I would definitely recommend to combination/normal skin.  Even without the clarisonic, my skin still felt fresh and clean after use."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,This is NOT Gentle,I bought this because it said it was gentle and there are lots of positive reviews. I thought it lathered well and washed off most of my makeup. My black liquid eyeliner that isn’t waterproof took much more scrubbing to get off. It felt tight that my skin felt stripped. I don’t have sensitive skin but dry and sometimes in the winter get small dry patches under my eyes. Using this made my skin feel so dry. I used my usual lotion and I felt burning. After about an hour I started to feel some itching. It wasn’t an allergic reaction more like the product was harsh. The smell isn’t great either. The next day I had some red rash-y areas. I never had an issue with acne or breakouts not even as a teenager. Needless to say it’s in a box going back.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Acne breakout and squeaky feeling,"I never write reviews but this product broke my skin out and I never struggle with acne. It also gave my skin a squeaky feeling along with my hands after rinsing. Not the squeaky clean feeling, it felt more oily like it hadn’t even washed my face at all. Really wanted to love this product but I’m going to trash it and go back to philosophy purity made simple cleanser."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,fitting name-gentle cleanser,Great gentle cleanser. I got this to try out since I was looking for something gentle on my hormonal acne prone skin and I love Korean skincare so I figured why not try this. The ingredients were appealing and as it turns out this was a great cleanser. My skin always felt clean but not stripped after washing my face and it didn’t irritate my sensitive skin. The only problem I have with this cleanser and this may just be a personal issue but my skin because very oily after I use it. I would wash and follow with my regular skincare routine but I would end up looking so greasy the next morning when I wake up or throughout the whole day. It is possible that this formula was working against me and removing my natural oils as well when i used it but like I said it was not stripping. It just didn’t work for me.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,"Ok cleanser, best to use for skin without makeup.","Very gentle cleanser. I wanted to try different cleansers to see what would work best with my skin. I use full coverage makeup with setting spray afterwards. Cleanser doesn’t seem to remove all the foundation the first time, usually have to use it twice in order to ensure my makeup is all off."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,High pH and drying,"This has a pH of 9 and it left my skin way too squeaky clean. My skin felt stripped and tight, which is never a good sign."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,HOLY GRAIL for anti-aging face wash!!,"I am sooooo happy I took a chance on this face wash. I had never heard of the brand before & didn’t really know where to start to look for a great anti aging face wash but this IS IT! I was looking for something to target fine lines, wrinkles, dark spots, uneven skin tone/texture/.. and I truly feel like Saturday Skin does it all. It takes off makeup, it hydrates & plumps skin for a dewy fresh glow. It is gentle enough to use on my one year old, is vegan & you only need a dime size amount at a time. I recommend this to everyone & anyone looking for a vegan, plant based amazing YOUTH RESTORING cleanser. I suggest following with Olenherskin Glow 2O Dark Spot Toner, anti-aging serum of choice & AM/PM moisturizer."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,I love it but dries up your skin,"I've been using this product on and off but still, I can feel a weight off my face. One thing I don't like about this product is that it leaves my face feeling like rubber. I immediately need to moisturize it with something after applying it which is ok."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Bad breakout,Gave me bad breakout after the first use - I decided to give it more try and continue using it for a month or so - it only got worse. Gave it to my boyfriend and caused breakout on his skin as well. Really wanted to love this product but I won't recommend it.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"This a great, gentle cleanser. It doesn’t dry out my skin and it is very lightly scented. I would definitely recommend for an everyday fave wash!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Truly amazing cleanser,"As a skincare junkie I’ve used a lot, and I mean A LOT of cleaners and this one is THE best. Once you start using it, it gets super foamy so a little bit goes a long way. Literally a dab is all you need for a full face of bubbles. After rinsing and drying, my face felt velvety soft, and not stripped or dry at all. Plus, it smells great too. Love this cleanser!!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"This cleanser cleans well and smells great, but it unfortunately leaves my skin feeling very dry. For that reason, I would not repurchase it, but I can see others enjoying this product. Another plus for me is that it did not cause my sensitive skin to break out as other products often do-- I just wish it wasn't so drying."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Clean and happy,"This is cleanser is kind to my problematic sensitive skin.  I have acne prone, combo skin.  It does not irritate and performs well!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,This was just OK. Did not break me out and my face was clean after use but it left my face feeling 'tight' and stripped of moisture. Not worth the price to me.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Best for clean skin,Great product! Smells like lemons when its on the face. Just be aware it will not take all your makeup off. Its more for a clean face to be applied. I havent breaked out after using this product so i will give it 4 stars because it doesnt take all of my makeup . A little goes a long way! Love the pink packaging so cute!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,Canada,Amazing product,This cleaners is amazing. It’s make my skin shine and brighter. I’ll recommend for everybody. I’m looking forward to more products of this brand.
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Great gentle cleanser,"Great gentle cleanser. Doesn’t leave my skin dried out. My skin just feels refreshed. Does a good job at removing makeup. I previously used Soy face cleanser, and while I really liked it, it did not remove makeup very well. This cleanser leaves my skin feeling great but I don’t have to scrub multiple times to get foundation off."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"I had been needing a good cleanser that was easy on my skin and didn't make me break out. This is definitely the one. To get the best results, use with the moisturizer!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"Nice, everyday gentle cleanser. Product emulsifies to a rich lather and has a lovely, mild fresh scent."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,good cleanser!,"it’s a really good cleanser. it works well with my sensitive skin. the formula is a bit runny but other than that, i really like this cleanser. it’s helped me with my acne lol"
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Pinch me I have to be dreaming,"I’ve been using this for two weeks now. I have very oily skin and it’s pretty sensitive once we get into products that are deep cleansing and oil fighting. A lot of them end up burning me before I can rinse the soap off and then my skin is dry and red for days because it has stripped every once of oil out. Not this product. It must beat the fruit extracts that make the difference but my face has really cleared up and the oil is totally under control. I’ve been working out pretty regularly the last few weeks which makes my oil production go through the roof. Every morning I wake up to a few tiny tiny Whitehead’s on my forehead And skin and that’s how I know this is really working to push out impurities. I also travel everywhere with ole henriksen grease relief wipes and I haven’t had to use them in about a week and a half. The product is scent free for the most part. I swear I can smell the faintest scent of fruit like trick cereal or something. But with one sniff it’s fragrance free. The product itself is very creamy I use about a half a dime amount add a drop or two of water and lather it on my fingers and spend about two minutes massaging the product into my face. With just one splash of water it all comes right off and doesn’t leave any residue behind. I typically find left behind on my cotton pad when I tone but nothing here. Amazingly my oily skin feels squeaky clean as if I used a microbead or exfoiliant but it doesn’t feel stripped. Just clean and soft. I’ve really never felt something like this. I’m also so so so happy to see how simple the packaging is. You get more than enough in a very basic pink tube. I love when I pay for product and get product I’m really tired of all the outlandish packaging that drives the price point up. Great face soap. If your face is typically an oil slick and you are sensitive to those harsh cleansers for oily skin. Try it!
I received this product for free from Influenster and Saturday Skin for testing purposes."
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Amazing product!,Clean skin with no stripping feeling and an overall improvement in skin clarity and suppleness. I love this product so much!
SATURDAY SKIN-Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,USA,Saturday Skin Rise + Shine Gentle Cleanser,"I purchased this product after Laniege re-formulated their multi old cleanser (bummed). I only like cream cleansers for my skin and this received similar reviews so I decided to try it. This isn’t as creamy of a consistency but I do use a face scrubber which helps create a nice lather. It leaves my skin squeaky clean which I like and visibly removes all dead skin, makeup etc. which is what I look for in my cleanser. Solid replacement"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,good you should try,my skin feels soft after the first used. one bottle last about 6 months. minus one star for the pricy
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Singapore,la mer,it's ok.. it does cleanses my face and smoothen out ny face but I have also tried other products that does the same but is slightly less pricey.. might not purchase this again though..
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Singapore,Love the scent and face feel smooth ,"Wow , first time buying LA MER product.  No regret . Simply LOVE the scent and after using my face feel smooth and it's really worth the price .Will try other products from LA MER. "
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Love it ,"The cleansing gel has a ‘herbal’ scent which I personally love it! It is soothing and my skin does not feel dry or ‘tight’ after using it. Just a tiny bit of cleaning gel is enough to cover the face and neck. However, I will try out the foam type since I have the sample from the counter. "
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,lovveeee,"I do used La Mer products’s range. And i love it. I got small size before and try it. And luckily it suit with my skins. The texture so good and The smells too. I used it day and night and feel my skin much better. Feelin fresh.It doesn’t make my skin any big changes which is good. Even though it a bit pricey, but it good to me. So maybe i will keep repurchased it. Thank you La Mer for good products ."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Singapore,So Lux ! So Good!,Using this at the end of a hectic day just gives me joy. The fragrance is light and refreshing. And using this in the morning doesn’t dry out my combi skin. Love it!
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,The Top/Lid is clear not Silver as pictured,"The Top/Lid is clear not Silver as pictured, other than that I like it and I will buy it again !"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Singapore,Clean and clean,Constant purchase for this cleansing gel. One of the better cleanser out there! Bottle is weighty and worth it for the price. I prefer to foamy texture however will use this on days for gentle wash 
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,la mer cleansing gel 100ml,"One week after using it, I love it. My face feels clean and fresh and soft. There’s no tightness of my skin. Which is a good sign for me. Despite what others have said about the smell, I have nothing against it. It smells like cucumber maybe? Which I love! I am giving it four stars because the bottle cap is loose! Imagine taking this with me when I travel! Such a hassle when the it can’t be closed properly. For such a price and the quality of the packaging is sad. Come on Lamer! "
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,WOW this was so much better than I imagined. It foams up real nice and the smell reminds me of a rich fancy hotel that puts those elegant bottles in the bathroom. It has improved my skin without drying it. I also bought the other La Mer cleanser that’s a lotion and find it excellent. If I had to pick one I’d chose the other one but since I struggle with acne I will use both. This in the morning and the other one at night. The bottle is big so it will last a long time. You only need 1 pump. It’s worth the money for sure!
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Singapore,My Fav!,"This is the best cleanser on repeat mode. I love the smell. It can last me longer usage. Yes it expensive, but faster shrink my breakouts. I felt clean after using this. I just love this cleanser"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Amazing Cleanser,"Amazing cleanser. I bought as my daily cleanser, but was surprised to learn that I could use it as a deep cleanser too. It takes off makeup well (1.5-2x pumps for make up, 1x pump without) even without makeup remover (not something I suggest doing, but if you run out it works!). The scent is light. I personally  prefer one without, but this one is tolerable since it’s very light. The thing I like most about the cleanser is the refreshed cleansing that lasts longer in the day than other ones I’ve tried before (the oiliness in the t-zone has stayed away even until evening, could be the weather or hormones but I’d like to think it’s my facial routine)."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"I am fully addicted to this cleanser… it is my favorite smell in the world, bar none, so I’m surprised to see many that don’t like it.  The cleanser is fine but I honestly buy it for that celery-like smell!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,My go-to,This is my 3rd bottle of cleanser. It is very gentle on my skin. The whole bottle lasts for months- at about 3-4 months for myself. It is definitely on the pricier side but it's def worth it! 
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,Horrible. Not sure if the product was expired but it make my acne much worse .. I tried different days to make sure and it was definitely this. Don’t recommend if you are prone to acne or oily skin.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"I had to think long and hard about spending $95 on a cleanser but so glad I bought this. One bottle has lasted six months using it twice a day. You only need a tiny bit to emulsify and using this along with my PMD sonic face  brush I’ve never had cleaner, clearer skin. Paired with the La Mer gel cream moisturizer thus cleanser has turned my skin around in the best way possible. Love the fresh scent and the gel formulation."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Excellent Choice!,"Buying this so many times already. In love on so many sights. Lol. You should really give a try, very gentle to your skin and it does the results. And compliments my Foreo"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Hands down to the best cleanser,"I LOVE THIS CLEANSER. i've been searching high and low for a cleanser that wldnt dry up my skin after double cleansing (im using shu uemura cleansing oil). i've tried most of the Korean cult favorite cleansers and nothing beat this. i tried using small sample which i get it from LM. and love it instantly. The smell of it is also refreshing and quite unique. The price though. But tiny bit (dont pump fully!), just a very gentle slight pump will be more than enough, it will lather a lot but still not drying. "
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,A bit pricey.,Less review I can see from online for this product and I think it is a bit pricey. This cleansing gel doesn’t has a good smell and it was a bit difficult to wash off .
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Disappointed!,The smell is awful and too strong! Couldn’t stand it. Too bad there’s no smaller size for this product. Had to finish the 200ml. Ergh. Won’t repurchase again.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,i have been using this since my mom tossed me the samples when i was 11. i love this cleanser but it is pricey!! i feel like it cleans really well and lasts a LONG time though!!!
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Buy something else.,The smell is awful. I used it twice and returned it. Way too much money for face wash that smells outdated.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Sensitive skin and I prefer the gel to the foam,"Although this is supposed to be more more oily skin, I have dry/sensitive skin and I really like this cleanser.  I was torn on which of the different cleanser formulations to order (gel, foam, oil, lotion) and decided to go with the gel due to the number of reviewers for the foam who called out it made their skin feel dry, tight, and irritated.  

I've been using this for a little over a week and really like it so far. Seems to be mild, my skin doesn't feel tight or overcleansed.  I've only been using it once a day; I use the micellar water to clean my face in the mornings. The scent is pleasant, sort of a clean/aquatic/marine neutral scent.  

I wish this came in a travel size. I may try the cleansing foam as it looks better for travel and does come in travel size, but will likely continue using the gel when at home."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,love it!!,"This is my favorite facial cleanser. Cleans, heals and prevents breakouts."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,MY MUST HAVE IN MY SKINCARE,"This is my first time writing a review. I love this product. Been using it for a week now along with the toner and my face feels so clean & soft. I feel like it works great for my dry skin. Give it a try, I love it. I saved up for them. Just wish it wasn’t so expensive, other than that it’s great!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Canada,Great investment,Great investment.  I’ve had this now for 1 year and it’s part of my skincare routine.  Pleasant scent and my face feels so clean and fresh.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Good Cleanser,"Although it has a slightly unpleasant smell, it’s a good cleanser that’s been helpful with my acne and some minor scarring
I may use it twice a day if my face feels gritty, sweaty, etc.
I also use (follow-up) the micellar water, the treat lotion then moisturizing soft cream (day or very warm weather) or the crème de la Mer (night or cold weather)"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"Thrilled with this cleanser, and a little goes a very long way!!! The fresh scent is really nice as well."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Canada,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,Amazing product. All of this brands products are perfect. Gentle but cleanses throughly. Smells amazing.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Canada,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"My favourite cleanser by far ! Love this product , it cleans leaving the skin so  nice and glowing , it’s smells so nice and fresh . Definitely a repeat , it  so worth it !"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,The best cleanser I have used hands down. I know this is a little pricey but this leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean/ literally nothing else compares. Fairly gentle for all skin types and this bottle lasts me forever. Definitely worth the price tag I will never use another cleanser. The gel works up a nice sudsy bubble and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and bright.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Canada,Best la mer cleanser,"This is my favourite by far of all of the cleansers. My skin is remarkably improved after use, but it is worth mentioning that I also find it to be thier most drying cleanser. I only use this once a day for that reason (at night) but have no issues with dryness when I wake up. I have slight dermatitis around my nose and one eye, and it does aggravate it when I use this product - but again, no issues upon waking! I love this product!!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Broke me out,This looked really good so I purchased it. It broke me out on my jaw line and I will never purchase this again.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Love it,"Can’t get over the smell, it’s fresh and beautiful.  It’s aggressively expensive but it does do an amazing job. It’s gentle, foams lightly and leaves me feeling clean AF"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Luxe,"I have dry skin and love this cleanser. The smell is luxurious, it foams perfectly, and one pump in the shower to wash my entire face and décolleté."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Amazing!,Hate to say it because it’s so pricey! But It’s amazing! It’s expensive but if you can afford it just get it! Squeaky clean
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Amazing if in your budget,"So La Mer is pricey. It’s expensive stuff. I started using the soft lotion in college because my skin was terrible (so many breakouts and huge pores) and it changed my life. I would have loved to use the whole line but I couldn’t afford it. Fast forward to now, I have a little bit of a bigger skincare budget. I love this cleanser. It smells heavenly, cleans so well, and helps manage my breakouts. Is it the best gel cleanser I’ve used? Definitely. It lasts me about 9 months- you only need half a pump for your whole face- and I look forward to cleansing every morning and night. But at the end of the day, it is a luxurious gel cleanser. If I had to go on a still strict budget I would spend it on the soft cream and treatment lotion, both which are life changing. If you can afford this cleanser it’s lovely. But it’s not the best of the la mer line if you’re on a budget. I will continue using this as long as I can afford it!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Disappointing :-(,I love love love la Mer but this broke me out on my forehead and jawline. I think it’s too perfumed for my temperamental skin. Sent back!
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,Canada,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"The cleansing gel is great. I use it in conjunction with the cleansing oil and its fabulous. It lasts forever and leaves skin clean and does not dry it out.

I highly recommend this product and will never remove this from my skincare regime!

Btw, I had combination skin and rosacea."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,refreshing scent,"I love the smell of this, it’s a very cooling cucumber/seaweed scent. Doesn’t do much for my skin as far as clearing it up but it’s a nice face wash to use for daily cleansing."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,Did not like it . Was difficult to wash off. Too expensive for what it offers.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,I love this,I wanted to hate this . But I got a sample then ordered 2 bottles . It legit makes my face look cleaner than any other face wash and leaves a glow I love it . I have acne dry skin and this stuff works . I’m a regular girl I use a lot of stuff from my dermatologist so I like to explore skin care . I love skin care more than makeup . This is the only face wash I’ve used where I saw a difference . I never stick with the same face wash when one runs out I buy a new one from Sephora . I will never use another face wash again but this . My credit card is sad believe me but it’s worth it . The bottle is huge . This will last me months .
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,I'm confused but it works really well!,"I got a sample of this bc I wanted to try it and I love the way it smell and it really does clean my face well and I think it may provide a more youthful appearance but it's not worth $95. I normally use clinique face wash or the body shop eucalyptus face wash.. and they both work to clean impurities in my skin. But this did deeply clean,, so maybe I will buy it.. Hmmmm"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,My new favourite skin cleanser!,"I love this cleanser. I'm careful with cleansers because I don't want to use anything that gives my face a squeaky clean feel or leave residual product. That just feels like all natural oils in my skin is being stripped off. I go back and forth between 2 cleansers, this one and the youth for the people superfood. No breakouts and the bottle pumps just a tiny amount onto my clairsonic which is all I need. My face feels clean. My first La Mer product and I'll most likely stock up on this during the rouge sale. My new favourite cleanser. I've been using for the last few weeks and the bottle looks like I've barely used it. I can see it lasting for a while. I remove all make up first and then wash face so I'm not having to use lots of cleanser."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Not for dry skin type,"I got a sample of La Mer Cleansing Gel and used it for about 2 weeks. You really need just a small amount to make it foam and leather. That’s the beautiful part about it. The glass container costs $95 but there is lots of product and I’m sure it would last me a year. It perfectly cleanses my skin and removedxmake up. I have also tried it with my Clarasonic Mia and it worked well.
On the negative side, it smells like cheap shampoo and it can be pretty hard to wash it of your face. I really feel like I’m washing my face with hair shampoo or shower gel. And after I finally wash it off, my face feel very tight, dry and I even have some redness (I would advice not to use it with a face brush if you have dry/sensitive skin). I also noticed my skin started peeling off (too drying) and I had to stop using this product. If you have normal/oily skin type, this product could work for you."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,LOVE!!!❤,I have tried so many cleansing gels over the past few years. I would have to say I have found the Holy Grail of cleansing gels! I love love thicleansing ng gel! I will  certainly repurchase for sure. I highly recommend ❤❤
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,love the foam,"This product has been sold out for a few weeks, even at Nordstrom’s. The sales associate at Nordstrom’s advised me that it is the company that hasn’t been shipping this product due to redoing the packaging l. She was nice enough to give me a few samples of this and I have been using it along with the la Mer cooling cream and my face has never felt or looked so clean and clear. I have rosacea on my cheeks and this cleanser has helped so much with small blemishes and cleared up my skin tremendously. Please!!!! Bring it back so I can get a bottle!!!!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Long Lasting,Good smelling thick texture which cleans well even taking my mascara off. I have oily skin and still had some breakouts with this. No dryness though. Just finished the bottle and it lasted a year and four months with regular use. Overall pretty good and minus the price and some breakouts.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,"Soft, Gentle, Great Smelling","Fell in love with this product when I first tried it 4 years ago. It comes in a convenient bottle, where you can control how much product you want. A little, truly goes a long way. Ive has a bottle last me over a year depending on how much makeup I need to take off. It smells fresh without a strong chemical or perfume scent. Lathers up quite well and rinses off easily. The best part is how it makes your face feel. Soft, clean and balanced! Non drying, no tight feeling and not oily. I’ve even had my daughter who breaks out use this cleanser and it’s made a difference. I can tell when she’s not using it. It calms her acne down."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,HANDS. DOWN. BEST. CLEANSER. EVER.,"This has cleared up my bumps from clogged pores and just given my skin an overall glow. I’m truly in love with this, and won’t ever use anything else. I didn’t think a cleanser would do so much for my skin but I was wrong."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,❤Holy Grail Product❤,"I have super sensitive, acne prone, oily skin.  Hormonal breakouts...you name it.  This product is amazing.  Yes, it's pricey, but comparable to a single facial.  A little goes a long way, and it consistently keeps my skin balanced."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,Absolutely love this cleanser. It’s lasts me a while so it feels like I get me $90 worth. This has been the face wash from my grandmother down to me. The family secret so clear skin!
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"I’m a lover of luxury products and La Mer is no exception. I had not tried La Mer cleansers until recently. 
I was hoping for the same results everyone was boasting about in previous reviews, but I have to stay I don’t notice a difference between this one and a drug store gel cleanser. I’ve been using it for almost 2 months now, and it does the cleaning job well, but nothing out of the ordinary. 
Also, the pump I find is a little too close inward so when you’re trying to get the product out you have to make sure your fingers are close.
Good heavy packaging, not ideal for travelling, but it looks pretty on the bathroom vanity.

I’d recommend it because it does the job, however if this is out of your budget, you’ll get the same results with a drug store gel cleanser."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"So I tried this cleansing gel and personally I don’t like it, I feel like my skin seems kind of dry even though it it clean’s well, I just still feel like it’s makes my skin stiff, I would not re-purchase this again, especially for the price."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,A MUST HAVE - BEST CLEANSER IN ALL OF SEPHORA,"I took advantage of the promotion and bought this cleanser - not expecting much - omg this is the best cleanser I’ve ever tried - I already repurchased 2 bottles to stock up. A small amount goes a long way, smells clean and refreshing as well as leaves your skin ready for the following steps. It’s a gel so obviously if you have normal or dry skin this is not for you. BUT for all combination and oily skin types this is a must have!!!!!!!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Gentle on skin and cleans my lash lextensions too!,"Best cleanser I've ever used. It kinda tastes like salt water, if you happen to get a smidge on your lips in the shower, and has a earthy natural scent.. But I love that I can also use it to wash my eye make off and it doesn't harm my lash extensions at all. I've used it for years now. Love it!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"La mer cleansers really cleans the skin. The gel is no exception. Squeaky clean feeling and using this every morning, the bottle lasts over a year. Always clams my skin."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Not Worth the Price Tag,Did not remove all of my makeup. Made my face feel so dry and tight. Not a fan of the smell or price tag.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Worthwhile and soothing,"While la mer at first seems pricy, only a little gel is needed per use making it a very worthwhile purchase. The smell of the sea is very soothing and it gently cleans and brightens the face; however, having sensitive skin I do not recommend using this more than once a day. Nonetheless, probably one of the best cleanser available on the market!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Helped correct dryness and breakouts,"I love this cleanser.  I use to have dry skin with the occasional breakout and this cleanser, help stop that.  This really gets all the oil, dirt and grime off your face.  I know the price in not ideal.  But this gets the job done."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,This product gets the job done. And a little goes a long way. Foams up really nice. A pea size is plenty. So you actually get more for your money when compared to other cleansers. I will say that this product is nothing special when compared to the rest of the La Mer line. I would save money by not buying this product and splurging on something else from this line.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,JADORE! Best Cleanser Ever,"Let me tell you... this cleaner is amazing. I have severe eczema that requires me to be on steroids to calm it. I can scrub my face 3 times, roughly in one wash with this and it NEVER irritates. Worth every penny! Plus it aided in ridding my skin of terrible acne! This replaced cetaphil which was the only cleanser I could use but I still broke out and had red irritated skin. I love this so happy I got a sample one days later I went back and bought the whole bottle. Lasts pretty well too. Only one pump. Suds like a dream!"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Too expensive for what it is.,Nothing special.  I used this for about 4 months and I can't see any difference and there are far less expensive cleansers out there with better results.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Beware if you have sensitive skin,"I switched from the La Mer foam cleanser to this, big mistake. This in one day caused irritation, rosacea flare up and several bumps on my forehead. Not sure what the combination of ingredients is that causes these flare-ups. I have fallen in love with the La Mer cleansing foam; it heals, evens skin tone and calms."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,I love this product! It removes all traces of makeup and my skin feels so soft and fresh after!
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,My Favorite Cleanser,Hands down my favorite cleanser. Been using it for my combination rosacea prone skin for over 10 years now. You need a pea size (literally) amount to cleanse your face. The fragrance is very subtle and it low lathers perfectly. Due to the very small amount needed I can use one bottle for about 6 months.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,I'm OBSESSED!!!,"I so badly wanted to hate this product because of the price, $90 is SO expensive for face wash. It is however worth every bit of money I spent on it. I've only been using it a week and my skin is SO much softer and more radiant.  I look dewy without anything else on my skin. I'll justify the price based on the fact I won't be using anyrhing else from now on."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer face wash,Honestly it's a good face wash but I don't think it's worth buying it for that amount of money.  I think $90 for face a wash is expensive.  I just wanted to know what the hype was about. But I don't think I would buy it again I can buy a  cheaper face wash and still get the same result.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,My poor face,"Had very high hopes for this product seeing that it's $90, but after I washed my face this left my skin feeling SO. DRY. All my natural oils just completely stripped from my face. Can't say I'll be repurchasing :("
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,I wish it was more affordable,"Non drying, mild, easily washes off, face is not tight afterwards, soft scent, fresh and clean.  I wish it was more affordable. In my opinion the dupe for this is the Kale + Green Tea and Spinach is almost exactly like it :)"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Lasts forever and is not drying!,"Okay, so I have true combo skin. Has to be the worst! I have used this cleanser every morning with my Clarisonic (LM does have a Foaming Cleanser, but I found it left too much of a residue on my skin) for at least 5 years. This bottle is huge and even if you use the recommended two pumps it will last you forever! I used to use only 1 pump and thought holy smokes, will this thing ever run out?! What's amazing is that it seems to truly cleanse my skin, while leaving the moisture barrier intact. I've never felt my skin was dry or tight afterwards."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,love,My very first LA MER product ever. So glad I splurged and got this face wash! The scent is lovely and it leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft. I have oily and sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate me at all.
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Sorry to say I've parted ways with my old Cleanser,"I have used Purity Cleanser by philosophy for many years. And in between would try and fail at finding anything else that would ever make me want to change until now. Three months and counting on this gel, and I'm in love. I'm 55 and wanted to try this. I got a deluxe sample, it goes along way. I use it on the sephora pink Face scrubby that has the little dots and lines on one end. And I seriously use less then a half a pea size on my face scrubby that I run under warm water first. If I'm removing makeup I do use the la Mer cleansing oil first then this gel. And found this combination so great that I don't feel the need to use anything else afterwards. I've been doing this for three months now and my skin has improved enough people are commenting on it. I also don't wear makeup all the time anymore. I do use the face perfecting cream by lamer daily and sometimes throw on my smashbox halo powder, lamer powder bronzer and lamer highlighter, and I'm good to go. Oh and lamer illuminating eye gel. I'm sold yes its expensive but soooo worth it."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,Best cleanser ever,"Feels amazing, cleans amazing, just everything is perfect I love it. Tried many different cleansers but always come back to this one time and time again"
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,La Mer The Cleansing Gel,"Feel like I've tried everything, and this cleanser leaves my skin feeling absolutely amazing. So clean and smooth. A little goes a long way. Love it."
LA MER-The Cleansing Gel,USA,finally La Mer at Sephora!!!,I have been using The Cleansing Gel for 2 years now and will never go back or use anything else.

This scrub is really refined it does not hurt your skin and is good for daily use.  It smells really good and the micro beads are very concentrated you only need to use a really small quantity (approx. one pea size) for the entire face. As such, one tube really can last a long time, mine lasted about 6 months. Highly recommended. "

It has a microbeads that leaves

DIOR-Prestige La Mousse Micellaire Face Cleanser,Singapore,MS,Love this product. It came in good conditions. Thanks Sephora for genuine product. 
DRGL-Cleanser Acne,,Tried for 1 year don’t see any result ,"Have tried this product for almost a year. I am a person who is persistence and patiently trying this product out. However, my acne still break out. But I must say it is light on skin. At the same time, it dries the skin. A bit dilemma if I should change out this product.  "
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,"Smooth skin, clear pores","Love this cleanser. Keeps my oily skin clear and pores are less congested.  Skin feels smoother.  I usually use this as part of my morning routine, then use a gentle cleanser in the evening."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,Minty fresh,This product is an absolute must have for your morning routine. It has a refreshing hint of menthol that really wakes you up but isn’t overpowering.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Not good even for oily skin,"I received this in my BoxyCharm this month and at first I really liked it. But after 3 or 4 uses I noticed it made my skin so dry, scaly and a little patchy. I have very oily skin, not even combo, just straight oily. It’s awful."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Not Great,This cleanser was just ok. It didn’t really foam for me so I felt disappointed since I was expecting that. And as a charcoal cleanser it was just in the mid range too. I feel like Fresh’s Charcoal Bar cleanser is much better.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,Just NOPE,Received a sample size in a promo. The WORST cleanser I have ever used. I don’t have sensitive skin and have never reacted to a product this way. After 2 uses my skin stung so bad. 3 days later and it’s still dry and painful. I couldn’t even pay my face dry without it hurting.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Singapore,Nice ,This cleanser was effective and left my skin feeling clean but not stripped. I enjoyed the light scent and the subtle minty feeling which made my skin feel very refreshed. 
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Love this cleanser! Leaves my face so smooth and haven’t had a break out since using it!
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Love this product I got it in a set but I have since found out they test on animals so i’m hesitant to buy the full
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,"Poor quality packaging, great product :'(",I love this product and have been purchasing it for years now but for some reason the cap on this particular one is peeling which is extremely annoying since I purchased it a a little less than week ago! This had never happened to me before... the product however is amazing and the only thing that works for my skin.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"I originally got this in a set, just so I could get the supermud mask, but my husband and I have really loved this face wash that now we are now restocking. This wash has dramatically improved his skin. When either of us have a bad break out, this wash helps clear it up without drying out our skin. Its worth the price for us as it actually works for our skin."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Love this!!,"Love this cleanser. I use it ever morning and always leaves me feeling clean and refreshed. I have sensitive skin, skin and it is one of the few products I have no issues with. I also noticed my skin is clearer with this product compared to many others I’ve tried."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,love!,"Gives my skin a healthy glow, min pores and helps with texture. Only con is the licorice smell is overwhelming"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Messy and stings,"Sadly, I hated this product. It makes a mess and it stings."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"It smells like the original mask but is grittier and less thick. I don’t use it as a cleanser, I essentially think of it like the original mask it in an easier to use form and I think it’s pretty effective for minimizing pores when used like this"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,GlamGlow,I Got This GlamGlow Super Cleanse Clearing Cream To Foam Cleaners From Influencer To Test It Out And I Love It! It Really Does Work And It Has Really Taking Away My Acne And My Face Feels So Good With This Product And My Face Feels Nice And Smooth With This Product It Takes Away My Pores Once I Use This Products I Could Feel My Face So Clean and fresh I'm Happy With This Product.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,LOVE IT,I got this cleanser in my monthly boxycharm and I had to get it again once I ran out! It’s such a gentle cleanser but still takes off my full glam make up with ease.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,MUST TRY,Great for oily skin but can be a little drying I loveeeee it
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Just a Baffling Experience,"I know this says that it is a cleanser, but it feels more like a runny clay mask. I've seen conflicting information on how to use this all over the place....do you use it like a cleansing balm (???) and apply it to dry skin with dry hands and then emulsify with water? Or do you wet in in your hands and then apply to dry skin? Or is it something else? At this point I don't know what's real anymore. It does not behave or feel like a cleanser going on at all. This semi liquid clay mask thing also feels like a wash off mask when you remove it. I don't feel well cleansed at all. In conclusion this is going to be used on my body unless I can find a way to make it work on my face."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Amazing for Hormonal Acne ☻︎☻︎☻︎,I struggle with hormonal acne and recently had a terrible break out… I have always used the SUPERMUD mask and has done wonders for me… Because of how bad this breakout was I decided to add 2 more products from the same line: SUPERTONER & SUPERCLEANSE…And all I can say is thank you GlamGlow!!!! I have finally found the combination of products that actually deliver results!! I use the toner and cleanser twice a day and the mud mask at night… every morning my skin is looking better and better… the pics below can speak for themselves… best money ever spent!!!
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Pleasantly surprised!,"I’ve actually come to loving this cleanser so much. I received it in a boxycharm a few months back and started using it recently when I didn’t have a backup for the cleanser I was using. Now, I will say it can be very drying but if used with a hyaluronic serum the dryness is easily subsided. This has cleared my breakout prone skin within a week and I now use this morning and night with no issue. I cannot stress enough that YOU NEED A HYALURONIC SERUM WITH THIS PRODUCT TO COMBAT DRYNESS. I swear it works!"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,Super drying…not for combo or sensitive skin,"Love this brand and their masks, so I was excited to try their cleanser. After 2 consecutive uses, this cleanser dried my skin out so much I started to get dry patches on my cheeks and a fine rash around my mouth and lip area. I would avoid if you have combo skin or can be sensitive to cleansers that dry out the skin. Hard pass.."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,"dried me out, messy, weirdly minty",This might be ok if you have very oily skin but it dried me out too much. It also had a weird tingly mint/menthol type smell and feeling to it which I did not enjoy. Reminded me of Noxeema for those that remember what that was. It’s also very messy. If you wash your face at the sink you will have to clean up your sink after you clean your face with this.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,love it!,I love the smell so much! Love the feelings while using this cleanser. It's cooling and I feel it absorbs all the oil from inside my pores. My skin feels really clean afterwards. No tight feelings at all. My tips~ I don't use it everyday because it may over-drying your skin (my skin is oily fyi) I use it like 3-4 times weekly evening. Or when I use a heavy makeup on that day. 
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,Great deep cleanse,"Great product bought this for my girlfriend bc she has oily combination skin and she loves it, works great for her I’ve tried it afew times as well and I was surprised bc I have dry combination skin and it cleaned my face nicely I also have eczema so was surprised it was gentle enough for me I just moisturize after for hydration great for oily skin or just build up does what it’s suppose to other then the foam didn’t notice much foam that’s the only step I didn’t like was adding water to it makes it soapy would rather a pump foam formula or even a gel to apply but that’s just me other then that it’s good for acne and blemishes it’s multi purpose so i thought it was nice could save money on serums bc of this product"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,No,Nope just nope. My skin can handle a lot but this just broke me out and I started noticing texture on parts of my face that weren't there before.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,how can I be trendy?,I thought this product would be promising but it’s definitely way overhyped and “trendy” pretty much a face dehydrator and acne prone skin run away! I tried this for a month and it’s a no!
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,"Drying, Itchy","I received this in my Boxycharm subscription.
After two uses my oily skin became super dry, patchy and very itchy. 
Also never foamed after adding water."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,Where have you been all my life?,"No Glamglow product has steered my (combination, leaning oily) skin wrong, much to my wallet's dismay. I should be buying shares in this company at this point.

Gave this a shot and...LIFE. CHANGING. I've always had the odd few adult pimples, ever-present milia, huge pores...after 2 weeks of use: GONE. This might be the first cleanser that is actually too good at clearing the oil from my face...considering experimenting with water-only morning face washes and just using this at night.

Love the minty-fresh smell and feeling, and a little goes a long way.

Yeah, it doesn't really foam up at all...but after all this, I'm not complaining!"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,wonderful cleanser for oily skin,I got this product in a boxycharm and fell in love. no other cleanser had made my face feel so GOOD! I highly recommend this cleanser and I love the smell!!!!
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,obsessed,"Obsessed, received this in my june boxy charm box and it has taken my acne away and evened out my skin in 1 week!! Highly recommend to anyone with acne !"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Honest review/oily hormonal acne,I received this in my boxy charm. I was skeptical at first because my skin hates me lol I’ve been using it for 2 months day and night. So this bottle lasts forever! Little goes a long way. I have oily/combo cystic hormonal acne so the fact that this has glycolic and lactic acid is just amazing. As well as the clay and charcoal for my oiliness. I feel like this really cleans my skin without over stripping it and leaves it super soft. Ppl complaining abt breakouts I’m pretty sure is purging. If your skin isn’t used to acids the skin cell turn over will make you temporarily break out/purge. I never experience any irritation or major breakout from this just a few spots here and there. And again I have cystic hormonal acne. This has helped clear my skin and keep it that way! I haven’t experience any new cystic acne since using this. I’ve noticed my skin is evening out and glowy. I love the smell I just hate that it has fragrance but that would be my only complaint!  I highly recommend this! Just make sure if your skin isn’t used to acids to test first!
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,not great,It feels like washing your face with toothpaste.  It hardly foams and is difficult to rinse off. I had to use my good old standby cleanser to finish the job
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,broke me out,"Got this in a boxycharm box and at first it seems super good and refreshing but then it ended up breaking me out really bad after using it daily for a week. Unlike others, I loved the smell! That was the only good thing that came from this mask."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,awful,"Received in a Boxycharm. Will never know if it is good or not, as the smell alone makes me gag. I hate black liquorice and there is no mistaking that this is all it smells like. Went right to the garbage."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"This is my daily morning cleanser (I use it on make-up-free skin), and I love it. My skin is visibly healthier after use!"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Amazing facial cleanser,I received this in my June boxycharm and I absolutely love this cleanser!!! It made my skin so soft and has cleared up any acne I had. I thought it was going to dry out my oily/combo skin but not the case. I will definitely be buying more.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,Get this!,"Got this from BoxyCharm and it took me no time to realize that would be a keeper. I love the smell, I love how I can see where I'm applying it and my skin doesn't feel over stripped. I'll be getting this again!"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"I received this face wash from my BoxyCharm box, and I was sooooo pleased with it that is has become my new daily cleanser. I love that it’s charcoal colored, as I never realized how many areas of my face I actually neglect when cleansing. It leaves your face feeling slightly minty and very clean, and does a fabulous job of removing all makeup. My only complaint is that it smells like black licorice. Not a dealbreaker for me since you just apply it to wash it off, but if that smell isn’t something you can handle, then BEWARE!"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Usually don't use Glamglow products but this worked really nicely. Not a huge fan of the scent but it left my skin feeling refreshed and soft.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Hard pass..right into the trashcan.,"Got this in my Boxycharm box a few months back and finally got around to using it. Would give this zero stars if I could. By far the worst thing I've used on my face - basic bars of soap are better. Leaves my skin looking dry, patchy, scaly and very irritated. It even dried out my hands so much that they look and sound like actual sandpaper. Having to use hand lotion just to alleviate the problem at least a dozen times a day. Will gladly stick with my Cerave."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,messy but worth it!,"I love this stuff! My skin feels so refreshed after using this cleanser. Yeah it’s messy, but whatever… at least my skin feels and looks great ✨ after my first few times using this stuff I bought two more boxes. seriously this stuff is amazing, give it a try!"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,dry skin review,"I was given this by a friend who got it as a gift. I have dry skin so I never would have purchased this on my own, but I really love this cleanser. I’ve been using it for a few months now and it leaves my skin feeling super soft and not as tight/dry as a lot of other cleansers. I always use a makeup remover before cleansing but this does a great job of getting the excess makeup off. I am not going to repurchase it yet because I want to try something more suitable for my skin type, but I could definitely see myself coming back to this"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,my face feels super clean,i took my time before i review this cleanser. but i have to say that i ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! i dont use it daily.. but i use it for days that i feel i need some deep cleansing of my soul.. lol jk... face .. or when im tired cause the minty scent wakes u up... 
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,Glamglow Supercleanse cleanser ,I like this product. I used it daily in the evening. At first worry it will be too strong or might strip My skin but that’s not the case. My skin feels cleansed without over drying. 
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Singapore,hubby loves this for his oily skin,"Great price great product, it has been hubby’s must have in the shower for the past year (even now!) and he will always repurchase this even though he does switch his cleanser sometimes. "
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,okay!,My first time trying this brand. Upon washing the face with the cleanser it has the tinge feeling it gives your face… It’s stated clearly it’s not a mask. It’s a cleanser that does the job!
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"Love using this mask!
Smells so amazing and you need the tiniest bit!
Super easy to use and makes your face feel refreshed and clean"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Never again!,"After three uses, it completely dried out my skin and caused tiny red bumps and itchiness. One of the worst cleansers I have ever used. I have combo skin and around my mouth and nose broke out the most. One star because this was definitely not worth it. Now i have to work on reviving my skin."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,Love it.  I've bought this 3x before writing this!,"I love this cleanser. A little goes a long way because it is consistency is very thick and will coat the entire face.  It lathers well, just add a little water. It's not super foamy but it does the trick.  My skin feels super clean, and not stripped.  I love all the ingredients in it,  and it's a large bottle.  I just repurchased it again for the third time. The first time I tried the smaller version and tested it before I made the plunge.  I always do that with my face products, everyone's skin is different and you never know what kind of reaction you will get from new products. 
I have an oily t-zone, dry skin everywhere else, and large easily contested pores. I wash my face with a battery operated spinning face brush.  I'm very satisfied with my clean results at the end."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Have always loved this mask! I am disappointed on how small this size is for the price. Seems like a little bigger than a sample size. Just note it is smaller than you think.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,Not for combination skin ...,"After reading the some reviews, i decided to try a couple of the Glamglow products. I got the Supercleanse in the Glamglow set along with the Supermud mask and a moisturizer and was really excited to try all of it. I didn’t really notice the cream to foam effect, but that wasn’t important to me. I have combination skin and tried this cleanser first, unfortunately after using it for 2 weeks, it left my skin really dry and tight. It didn’t work for me and was ultimately returned. This cleanser may have better results for someone with oily skin."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,great product!!,It took a few weeks but I’ve noticed a difference. My skin is more glowy and soft. The acne on my jawline from wearing masks have gone away which is a huge relief because I’ve never broken out like I have the past few months! I also use the glam glow mud mask 1-2 times a week and the moisturizer every morning.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,I have used this a few times a week for two years and I love it. It leaves my skin clean but moisturized — doesn’t over dry. I also love the way it smells!
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,favourite cleanser!,"I’ve used this product for over 2 years and I keep coming back to it. Even though it’s $50+ CDN, I only need to buy it 2-3 times a year max because the cream-foam formula lets you get away with using less product. I have combination-oily skin that is prone to hormonal break outs and this really helps my skin control sebum/oil production. This has liquorice root extract in it and you can definitely smell it which I thought I would hate but it’s oddly really refreshing when paired with the peppermint oil scent in this."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Keeps my occasional outbreaks at bay. I’m torn because I am also using the new Tatcha cleanser& I’m not sure which one is the better of the two! I guess I will have to further investigate.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Singapore,Pretty decent ,This is a pretty decent cleanser. I love the scent and it feels really fresh/refreshing after use. It was not really right for my skincare needs as I was trying to clear up some discolouration/hyperpigmentation but it does make your skin feel really nice. If you have pretty good skin already this may be a nice addition to your skincare routine. There is mint in this though so those with sensitive skin may want to be weary and try a sample first! I worked in skincare a couple of years and noticed some people are quite sensitive to mint. 
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,HOLY GRAIL!!!,"This cleanser is hands down my favorite! It keeps the pimples away. However my skin is very finicky, if I go for all products for oily skin, my skin drys out and breaks out. But if I go for only dewy skin products I get oily and break out. So I just go in with this cleanser which is targeted for oily skin then I use the purity made simple cleanser during the day and the drunk elephant moisturizer that’s in the greenish packaging at night. I’m so happy I finally found the perfect combination for my skin. Also side note, it smells just like black licorice, which doesn’t bother me, but some people might not like it. I will forever repurchase!"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,Awesome cleanser for oily skin,"Love this cleanser! I use this a couple times a week to clear off any leftover makeup, and my pores always look clearer and and my skin feel clean and fresh, and I have large pores and really oily skin."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,smell amazing,it's really subtable for oily skin to be honest .. I do love to use it only when I had a terrible breakout or heavy makeup not recommend to use for everyday use .. 
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Happy with a glam glow ...,does a good job ...  leaves face looking good !! will continue to use ...
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,Foam Cleanser Super Duper Awesome!!! ,Produk yang sangat bagus. sesuai untuk kulit muka yang berminyak. kulit makin sihat dan kurang berminyak. harap dapat bantu selesaikan masalah kulit muka yang berminyak teruk macam saya... 
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,this stuff is legit,I absolutely this cleanser I got a small sample size with my Sephora points and later bought a full size. I don’t really see the cream to foam aspect but it’s super gentle yet effective. I have had no break outs or pimples since using this cleanser. I have very oily combo skin so I use this twice a day and it doesn’t bother me at all! Love love love this.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,I glowed!!,"This cleanser worked for me. Used few days and my face did indeed glowed and gave no reaction to my combination skin. After using you could feel the cooling effect on your face. Only put off is the smell, it has a fragrance of a toothpaste. But overall worth the buy!"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Refreshing!,"I received this cleanser in a Sephora Play box a while back and I decided to try it tonight. I enjoyed this cleanser as it smells really good with a light mint scent. I followed the instructions to use a generous amount, add water, and rub a lather on the hands to apply to dry skin. Although I really like this cleanser, I did not get the cream to foam experience. It did well with removing my leftover makeup and I could feel the tingly feeling that is common with the Glam Glow masks to let you know the product is working. I would probably buy this when I'm looking for a new cleanser to help with clearing up my skin and keeping that youthful glow."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,highly recommend for oily skin type,I tried the set and loved the product so I bought a full size. At first the scent was interesting but when you see the results you’ll be happy. I have large pores and this helps cleanse my pores and helped control my oily skin type. My skin feels and looks smooth.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Wonderful!,"I love how this makes my skin feel so soft and clean! It almost feels like I exfoliated, but I didn't! I have super sensitive skin, so this is great for me."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,LOVE. THIS. PRODUCT.,I 100% live by this product. I seriously haven’t been able to find a face cleanser like this one that really gets it clean and clears up my blemishes. I get irritation bumps around my eyebrows and chin area from waxing and this is the only thing that dries it up quick! Very satisfied.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,PERFECT,My go to always! I just love how nice and clean my face feels with out drying it out... I have oily skin and this really helps my skin look better and better...
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Singapore,ms ,"Nice cleanser, I have oily skin and it works well for me. 
Not too pricey and it does its work.
Though it did leave my skin a bit dry and tight after use, which I personally do not mind.
But maybe it is not very suitable for dry skin."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"Defiantly makes my face & skin feel fresh & soft , and works great !."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Repurchasing !!!,"Wasn’t sure about this but I tried a glam glow body scrub sample and I adored it so I figured I’d give this a try. I have combination, sensitive, acne prone skin with some dry patches (a real winner I know:P) and it doesn’t leave me feeling overly dry or irritated at all. It does have a strong mint scent which I personally love but isn’t everyone’s favorite. I just love how clean it makes your skin feel, without completely stripping it"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,Perfect for Summer time to remove yucky dirt.,"I love Charcoal, but combined with the mint smell it is wonderful.  It sucks up all the extra dirt and grim you get in summer heat.  it is so good that my super outdoor active husband has basically confiscated it for himself.  I am super happy with this."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,LOVE,My favvvvv. I always come back to GG. Feels soooo good on my oily skin leaving me nice & matte.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,One of my favourites,I’ve bought this several times and it’s my favourite facial wash. It leaves my skin so soft and clears up my blemishes. It does have a strong scent but I don’t have any fragrance irritations so that part doesn’t bother me.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,Will repurchase! Love it!,I’m really a fan of the mask from this range so I decided to purchase this cleanser to include it my routine. Love this cleanser because it is not very foamy but still really leaves your skin clean without the tight effect and won’t feel like it strip off all your face’s natural oils. 
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,amazing cleanser,"best cleanser I've used, keep going back to it! really clears up my skin without drying or irritating it!! love!"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,Worth it ,First time trying this cleanser. It cleanse skin thoroughly and leaving skin feel clean without drying it. Hope it will treat well on my oily skin and reduce pore appearance 
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"Yes, yes and yes! Helped my skin so much. I have a very sensitive skin that reacts negatively to so many products, but not this one. Even though it does contain some irritants, perfume...erm... it does not break me out, might be due to the fact it gets washed off the skin. When I want the feeling of super cleansing, I put it on my face for 3 minutes and then wash out."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"Been using this for 8 months nightly only and counting. Crazy how much product you get-so you definitely get your moneys worth. I tend to have hormonal break outs around my jaw and bought this to help clear it up. Some negatives I found (which really aren’t a big deal) 1. I noticed that if I don’t do a double cleansing this product won’t froth up as nicely, even if all I wore that day was under eye concealer. 2. Since it’s a charcoal cleanser when I wash my face in the sink the charcoal water residue gets everywhere and makes a mess. If I miss a spot when wiping up it will leave a discolored mark.  3. I use this with mu Clarisonic and I would say it’s probably not the greatest as the charcoal get stuck in the bristles and it’s hard to get out. Besides those things I think it’s a great product. It cleanses my skin nicely, doesn’t leave me feeling dry and didn’t break me out even more. I don’t know if it necessarily helped clear up the scars as I started using other products at the same time but I’ve definitely been noticing my acne/scares aren’t that bad lately. I won’t be repurchasing because I have a constant need to try new products. However, If you’re looking for a charcoal cleaners then totally got for it!"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,Really Works!,"I have dry skin and I must say I love this cleanser! I use it in the morning and when I tell you this actually got rid of any blemishes on my face. It’s not really that drying to my face but I just make sure to follow up with hydration and moisture after and I’m fine. I definitely recommend along with the toner. They keep my face clear I hardly get blemishes now, only that time of the month"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Singapore,good ,It’s a good cleanser keeps your skin clean and fresh only downside is the price ... can get better cleansers at lower price but a good try not bad ... the smell is peppermint 
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,Get that glow,"This is by far a very good cleanser. Your skin feels refreshed, smooth and your pores are refined.
A little goes a long way and you have that slight minty sensation. "
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,glamglow supercleanse,"I'm a fan of glamglow product however this cleanser was a disappointment. it tries to be too complicated for a cleanser, and the result is not spectacular compared to a drugstore cleanser."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Smell very minty and a little goes a long way.,I love that this product got rid of the oil on my face and left my face feeling smooth.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Needs a new cap!,"I do like the face wash, haven’t noticed a big difference in my skin. The one complaint I do have is that I wish it had a flip top cap. The screw on and off bulky cap makes it hard to use in the shower without wasting product."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Great cleanser :),Cleared up my acne used this since dec 2019! Love this product
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"I held off for so long buying this but I finally bit the bullet and couldn't be happier. My skin loves Glam Glow, helps with breakouts (preventing and during), doesn't dry my skin out, leaves it feeling amazing"

GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,I <3 Glamglow,"hands down, the best cleanser!! did try few new options from @sephora PlayBox, but still go back to @glamglow!!"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Broke My Skin Out,"I have combination skin (gets oily throughout the day) and was really excited to try out this product since I loved the Youthglow cleanser. This did the opposite of what I was expecting. Within a week, my skin (cheek area) broke out. Pretty disappointed with this product given the retail price. I wouldn't recommend it. This is the first charcoal-based product that broke my skin out."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"I absolutely adore this cleanser, it completely changed my skin!! I used to have lots of blackheads and congestion plus pimples on my chin and hairline,  using this cleanser twice a day cleared everything up within weeks!! Before going on vacation to Hawaii I used it in the shower on my body acne and boom, you could never even tell I had acne in the first place!! Can not recommend this enough!!"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,Favourite cleanser all the time!!,"I love this cleanser. It makes my face feel so clean. Although the price tag is a bit high, but I like the way it makes me feel when I wash my face. Glamglow is my favourite everyday cleanser! 
"
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Malaysia,New Favourite ,"It cleanses my skin well and it has helped me fight my breakouts too. Since I have oily skin, this has helped me with it and it doesn’t make my skin too dry too. "
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Cleanses deeply,"I have quite normal skin. (neither oily nor dry, never had acne or sensitivity). With that said, I appreciate this cleanser because it deeply cleans my face and leaves no residue as “sensitive” cleansers do. I prefer no residue left from cleanser because I can feel that my moisurizing products absorb to a fuller extent."
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,"I have several products from GG and keep going for more. I got the cleanser, the masks and all. It works great on my combination skin not to dry not to greesy so i keep buying it. Definatly my to go face wash."

GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,Canada,Calm Cool and Clear,Love the results from this product.  Non-irritating and leaves my skin feeling really clean.  Best product I have found for acne prone skin.
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Effective Cleanser!,This has been my favorite cleanser so far. With all these nighttime masks and oil cleansers I really need a deep cleaning face wash and this one is just perfect. My skin feels squeaky clean after I use this!
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,i love this cleanser! doesn’t dry out skin at all! would recommend for anyone who is oily or combo skin!
GLAMGLOW-Supercleanse™ Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser,USA,Not for Combination skin types,"I bought this cleanser, not knowing anything about the line. first time I used it my skin felt great, clean and soft, I couldn't wait to use it the next day. 3 days later after using it only at night my skin was so dry and flaky I had to stop using it. I have combination acne prone skin. It's more for oily skin in my opinion."
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,Canada,Love the brightening gel cleanser!,"I am using the brightening eye cream and age defying cream from the Juice Beauty brightening line and I am seeing such fantastic results! For an organic and clean brand, this is very effective for evening out my skin tone. I have dry skin but it can get oily. This cleanser gently but effectively cleanses my skin without irritation. It has even helped with some of the rough parts of my skin. I have noticed that my skin care products absorb better and my skin feels so fresh afterwards! Sometimes I massage and leave it on for one minute to get better results. One of the best gel cleansers I have used. I highly recommend it! :)"
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,Canada,love the product but needs better packaging,"I've really noticed a difference in my skin feeling softer and looking brighter after starting using this. I'm hoping it will help with some dark spots long-term. I hate the packaging though, the product left at the tip of the nozzle dries out and it squirts product all over the place when I use it the next morning."
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,Canada,Smaller size same price,Love this cleanser have been using it for around 4 years.  When reordering noticed the size has reduced from 4.5 oz. to 4 oz.   Would be five stars if they hadn't changed the size.
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,Runny jelly consistency and smells like floor cleaner.
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,USA,Dark Spots Gone,I bought this Green Apple line a few years ago and have been using it ever since . I used to have a major issue with hyperpigmentation which made me very self conscious I tried so many products ranging from 20-200$ and nothing worked until I used Juice Beauty I use the Green Apple Cleanser with the Emulsion serum and moisturizer and my face is never Dry or oily I have no dark spots and have very little fine lines Definitely if you are suffering from hyperpigmentation by this but if you have sensitive skin stay away from the Emulsion
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,Canada,LOVE IT,"This has been by far the best cleanser I’ve ever used. I start off by using this cleanser and following by Sephora collection serum.. and using the SPF juice beauty moisturizer (morning) and juice beauty anti-aging moisturizer (night) it does WONDERS my face looks brighter and healthier than it ever did before. I’ve seen results just after a week. If your looking for a cleanser that cleanses properly, refresh and brighten your skin THAN THIS SHOULD BE YOUR NEW CLEANSER."
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,Canada,not brightening,"bought this solely because sephora is always sold out of the indie lee brightening cleanser...and well this cleanser doesn't do anything. if you're just looking for a cleanser it does that job, but does not brighten at all"
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,Smells and feels great! It foams up as well which is quite nice. Very gentle on my sensitive skin.
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,Canada,Dont buy,I was told this would help with my acne scars and it absolutely did not. it just made my face really bright.
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,Canada,No brightening effect,"I bought this because every retailer was sold out of the Indie Lee brightening face wash. Reviews seemed good. Let me tell you this product is useless, didn’t do anything for me."
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,Didn’t brighten my skin but it left it feeling really soft and supple.
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,Canada,"Fresh, clean feeling :)","(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I got this in my FabFitFun box and I love it. I have issues with acne on my chin (never had it until I hit adulthood), so I switched from my acne cleanser to this and love it! I am currently ordering the serum also :)"
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,Canada,It actually works,Very good cleanser. After a few days of use I notice the difference. It does brightens the skin tone. Love the results
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,I have combination skin which gets very dry and dehydrated in winter. But this cleanser makes my face feel very balanced and brightens my complexion. It does not dry it out always love cleansing with this product.
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,USA,Pass....,"I had high hopes for this cleanser after reading a few reviews saying that people with sensitive skin were having no irritation problems after using it. Sadly for me, I’m not as lucky, and that’s not the case. I have sensitive combination skin that gets really dry in the colder months, so normally I opt for a gentle cream or foaming cleanser during those months. In the spring and summer when the weather warms up and my skin is greasier and I sweat more, I go for a gel cleanser. Being that this one was organic and didn’t have horrible reviews, I opted to try it. Sad to say I will be returning it as it’s nearly summer, it’s already hot here, and it’s still drying the heck out of my face. Also, it smells chemically and fake. I’m a huge scent fanatic for any beauty product, and this one is a bit hard to handle. I’d recommend staying away from this if you do indeed have sensitive skin and don’t like harsh scents."
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,USA,Juice Beauty Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,"very gentle and foaming cleanser, it has really helped to brighten my skin and doesn't dry it out!"
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,USA,Juice Beauty Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,I used this product for a month and didn't see any change on my skin... there's no foams when I clean my face so I don't know if I use enough product or to much. This is the second time I try this brand and it seems that their products doesn't work on me. I'm very disappointed I really wanted to love  Juice Beauty...
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,USA,Great morning cleanser,A great all natural product. Really helps brighten your skin. Works best in the morning. I will be repurchasing this again!
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,USA,Best Underrated Product,This should be a staple item in everyones skin care routine! Natural/Organic products are so important to me so when i found this i was beyond excited. I have noticeably brighter
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,USA,Amazingly gently and effective,"I was not sold on this product initially to be honest, it's very mild and more of a watery sort of substance, not so much of 'gel' cleanser as i was expecting. However I've been using it daily  and have noticed a great improvement in the clearness of my skin. Super impressed."
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,USA,No toner needed,I have used this product for a few years now- I wear heavy foundation and with just one maybe two pumps of this cleanser it cleans up all traces and when using a toner following cleansing did not see any leftover residue on the cotton wipe! That to me is a bonus-one less step in the daily routine- yes it's a bit runny but just rub your hands together to get the foamy action going and cleanse away all the impurities!  Will continue to using this as long as it's available! A little goes a long way too!
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,USA,gentle,I have super sensitive skin and know pretty quickly with new products. I like this because theirs no junk in it. I'am still new too it just at the end of my first bottle. My skin feels fantastic. I have oily with blemishes on the regular and this cleanser keeps my skin balanced. Honest my blemishes are far and few in between now. Wish I could buy this in store. It's only online.
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,USA,Gentle yet effective,A lovely light cleanser with a soft fragrance. Foams nicely and would work great with a Clarisonic. A little goes a long way. My skin is noticeably brighter and my skin tone has evened out with reduced redness. Only downfall is that this product is very runny/watery so it's best to get a froth going with it right away. Otherwise it's a nice cleanser. Not a must-have but being vegan and organic is a huge plus.
JUICE BEAUTY-Green Apple Brightening Gel Cleanser,USA,nice smelling cleanser,Definitely a plus if your into organic & natural products as it does what it says. I use with a clarisonic for my combo skin and it feels fresh & smooth and my skin has brightened. Only downfall is that is on the runny side
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Singapore,effective and gentle,I loveeee this cleanser! It makes a really nice lather and a little really goes a long way. It doesn’t have a strong scent which is also nice for those with sensitive skin. I like that it’s effective in clearing up my skin but not stripping enough that it leaves my skin feeling tight after. Will purchase again!!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Singapore,Gel Cleanser ,Used it twice already. It’s scented which I don’t mind and it cleanses off well. Had been using Peter Thomas Roth acne cleanser for a year and it was out of stock for sometime so moved to the Cloud cream cleanser. Since I saw this one thought of giving it a try which I have no regrets purchasing it. 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Australia,overly fragranced ,"A strong fresh style scent similar to Biotherm too strong for my teenage son and myself. Packaging left quite abit in the bottle after the pump reached as much as it could. Gel texture, lathers only into a slightly thicker cream with fine foam. good first cleanse for makeup but not great. Doesn’t strip skin but I wouldn’t use as a morning cleanse as I prefer something more nourishing. Was fine on my sensitive skin and eyes, no reaction. Won’t repurchase due to fragrance. "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,This might be my favorite cleanser I’ve ever tried. Smells a little bit like sprite or mens deodorant but that doesn’t bother me. Leaves my skin feeling soft and clear. Lathers nicely. Washing my face is the best part of my daily shower/routine now. LOVE
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Australia,Love it!,"As an older person I need a cleanser that removes all make up and muck without drying and this product fits the bill 100%. A little goes a long wsy, too. It has a scent, but not one that bothers me. I highly recomnend this product. "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,Favorite face wash!!,"I’m a skincare junkie. Honestly, I buy way too many products and rarely finish any. But this face wash? oh my. After the first week of using it I put away my rest of my washes and haven’t used any others for 2 months now. This stuff is great. Removes everything, effective yet gentle, and my skin looks and feels great after washing. I personally love the smell too, it’s so good and not overpowering. I use this with the PTR water drench spf moisturizer in the morning as well. I just love this whole line!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,Best Cleanser Ever!!!,"I buy the acne products for my daughter, which has helped her tremendously (she uses the cleanser, pads, and gel) Then, I needed my own cleanser and figured I may as well give this cleanser a try. And I am in love with this cleanser. I have sensitive skin and this doesn’t dry out my skin. I stopped using my current cleanser and even recommended this to my friend, and my mother who is a die hard Lancôme fan."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,why would you put this much perfume in a cleanser?,"I'm really not sure how well this works, I could get past washing my hands with it - my first test for any face wash I buy. if I can't stand it on my hands, it doesn't go on my face. this did not pass the test. the sent in this is ""soap"" but yelled through a megaphone - and it lingers. for hours. I couldn't get my hands near my face without my eyes watering, and after 4 hours, had to wash my hands with something else just to try to dampen the effect. even doing a double cleanse didn't remove the smell entirely. wish I could tell you more about the product, but I couldn't get that far"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Great cleanser! It removed all my eye makeup and didn’t leave my skin feeling stripped and dried out.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,"I've used the older version of the Cloud cleanser which was great.

PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,New Bae,"First purchase from PTR, I’ve been dying to try many of their products but this one finally caught my attention and now I need to try more ptr! This face wash smells so amazing to me, I love origins frothy fw & this also cleans really well. I need my cleanser to be efficient but gentle and this is it, a small amount will do the trick especially w double wash! A new favorite! Fragrance is low on list, smells so good but an advisory. I’d recommend"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,new favorite cleanser but very strongly scented,"Amazing cleanser, very strong scent. This cleanser is fantastic, I’ve been using PTR cloud cream cleanser for the past few years and recently switched to this one, cleanser is 5 star, I actually had a mini breakout when trying this cleanser out and was worried about how something so scented would do with it, did an amazing job, however the scent is really strong, smells like men’s cologne a great scent but I don’t know if I love it in my face wash especially considering how strong of a scent it is."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,To fragrant,Would of been perfect if this was fragrant free.It’s a very thick creamy gel like that lathers nicely.It removed all my makeup included mascara (I don’t use waterproof) so I’m not sure if it does.And you only need a dime size.This cleanser will last you well over 6 months.If you like fragrance in your skin care then some will enjoy this cleanser.

I’ve tried SO MANY as a teenager, and I will never use another one besides this. It totally got rid of the little bumps on my forehead which were extremely stubborn. Buy it!!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,True Deep Cleanser,"I like this deep clay cleanser from First Aid Beauty. It can be a little drying but if it’s followed by a hydrating face cream like Ultra Hydrating Cream from First Aid, then it’s not as bad. I love the earthy scent and the way it deeply cleanses my face without stripping and irritating it. It does not leave my face tight or red. It helped me a lot with my acne problems and it moisturized while it cleansed."

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Singapore,1st time trying,Bought it for partner as he has very sensitive skin. so far his face is getting better. The product has gilttery and mild smell to it. will continue to buy this product. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,All time favorite facial cleanser!,"My go to face wash. Definitely keeps acne in check. I've tried other stuff but this one is my favorite and works the best...
I have minimal breakouts during ""that time of the month"" and this product is super gentle and my acne clears up fast."

BUT, this is the only product I switched in my routine for the past month and my skin has never looked better.  Smooth, poreless, soft.  I am completely amazed.  Incredible what the right cleanser can do for your skin.  So happy!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Australia,One of my faves ,I use this cleanser on a rotating basis with their other cleanser and I love both. This cleanser has a more rough feel to it which leaves the skin feeling cleaner and tighter. The only thing I don't like about it is the smell but that goes away as soon as it's washed off your face so not a deal breaker for me. will continue to use and buy more when I need it. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,New Zealand,"Great cleanser, especially for acne prone skin! ","This is one of the rare cleansers that doesn’t break me out while actually cleansing my skin and leaving it feeling fresh, clear and soft! The ingredients are amazing and none are comedogenic, or will create a nice environment for fungal acne, which can be a nightmare… I’ve tried countless others and always come back to this one. I also had a really bad breakout recently after I ran out of this product and once I bought another tube and was able to use it again it helped a lot with the inflammation, redness and healing process. It’s also not too strong for daily use, although I do not have particularly sensitive skin. The only reason I don’t give it 5 stars is because it does not do much to reduce oiliness - I tend to have very oily skin so need to use a combination of products, this one alone wouldn’t make much of a difference. But overall an amazing product! "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Singapore,Amazing! ,This is amazing! My favourite cleanser of all time and i’m purchasing my 2nd bottle now! my face has been the clearest ever! initially i was a little skeptical even after reading the reviews. but this really works for me! and before this i was using dr dennis gross which was alright.

If there’s zero star rate I’d go for it!"

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,True Believer,I noticed an immediate difference in how oily my skin was plus I love that it doesn't leave my skin feeling dry at all.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,holy grail,When buying this face wash I was skeptical as it claimed to be good for sensitive skin !!! And to my surprise it actually is it also combines very well with my oily skin and Does not cause any break out which is a major plus for me since everything breaks me out !!!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,NOPE,Awful. It burned my skin. I tried it 3 times just to make extra sure and it was just so awful. I would definitely never ever buy this again.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,works wonders for my oily/acne prone skin,"i have oily acne prone skin. although this cleanser isn't targeted towards acne, i have found it to cleanse my oily skin well without stripping it, then i use acne treatments for my acne. this does help a lot when it comes to maintaining clean skin. i have tried to switch over to other cleansers but always come back to this one. have been using this for almost two years. got my younger sister on this too!"

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Great cleanser but use it quickly,I love this cleanser! It’s great for my oily acne prone skin. I only use it at night after an oil cleanse. Nothing really makes my skin feel as clean but not stripped. My only complaint is that the smell turns pretty quickly. Be sure to use this within a couple of months and don’t have many cleansers on the go. If I don’t use this us in two months my cleanser ends up smelling like cheese!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Feeling fresh,Super great for removing all makeup/dirt/oils that have built up throughout the day. Prevents from overnight breakouts!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Not Amazing But Does Work,This does a decent job. It did stop my breakouts however it didn't really feel like it cleansed my skin. The smell of the clay was not great but got used to it.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,"No matter how many new face washers I try, I always come back to this one."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Go To Cleanser.,My go to cleanser. Works great on my skin which can be reactive at times. The only thing is that I wish it had a better top on it; dropped it once and it cracked which led to some product leaking out.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Malaysia,pores look cleaner,"it's good, paired together with glow recipe cleansing balm, it works great and really clears out the pores. the consistency is quite liquidy, so make sure to keep the bottle the other way up to prevent spillagw"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Australia,Great When Removing Make Up,I use this after I use a cleansing balm for my double cleanse routine. I don't use this on the daily because I found it left me more dry/dehydrated over time. Using it my double cleanse though helps ensure no risk of breakout from remaining make up. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Australia,cement in a bottle ,"I love this, thick awesome exfoliate absolutely will buy again, wish the packaging was biodegradable tho I buy quite a few things at Sephora and I feel like there is far too much plastic "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Australia,it’s okay ,"Haven’t seen any difference in my skin yet however I do enjoy this cleanser, it comes out red with shimmer and lathers white on your face so don’t be afraid of it staining, it won’t "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,go-to daily cleanser,I’ve been using this for a little over a year now as my primary facial cleanser and it is my absolute go-to. I have a weak skin barrier so it’s super important for me to ensure that my I have a cleanser that can dive deep into my pores.  It has decreased my overall breakouts. I prefer products that aren’t scented but this one isn’t too bad.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,helps me avoid breakouts,Tried switching cause I got bored and my skin is staring to age. Bad idea. This face wash has consistently kept me break out free for years. I wear make up daily and my breakouts are more about clogged pores than anything else. My only reason for a 4 instead of a 5 is that it doesn’t remove makeup but at least it’s not harsh on myskin.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Amazing!,I love this face wash. I have combination skin with big pores and my face has been feeling so clean since I switched to this.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Holy grail!! I have fungal acne and this has saved my skin
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Love!,Absolutely love this product. Super gentle and does wonders for acne-prone skin!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Not worth it,"This cleanser did nothing for my skin. Wanted a cleanser that would deep clean my pores and help with acne caused  by wearing a mask. I’ve used it for around two months now to give my skin the time to adjust to it, and there has been no change. The cleanser aggravates my acne more than helps it.
The packaging was also an issue, couldn’t leave the bottle standing up with out the cleanser leaking out of the bottle"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Great daily foaming cleanser,"Excellent cleanser. I breakout easily so I really need to use a foaming cleanser. My skin tends towards oily, but can get dry easily too. I use this every morning with my clarisonic facial brush (which is far superior to the other Faro sonication brush). I buy 10 of these at a time so I always have one on the shelf. My brother started using it too. Clearly he has good taste."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,WORTH EVERY PENNY,"I’ve been testing out a few cleaners lately, didn’t mind the First Aid Beauty original cleanser but this one I notice the difference in my skin looking significantly less oily!! It’s a dream"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,AMAZING soo gentle and hydrating. I’ve tried soo many cleansers and this one has by far been the best :)
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Useless,I used it for months and did nothing for me. The formula is very guppy and it spills easily out the bottle if you leave it standing up. Its kinda messy and the clay does nothing. Im going to try something else. I wish I could return it.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Amazing!,"I have sensitive skin and the minimal ingredients have caused no breakouts. I've been using this as a second step cleanser in conjunction with albalene. I love the way it leaves my face feeling. It's an amazing product and the price point is just great, I will warn you that you either love the scent of the product or not. I happen to love it."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Its fine for a simple cleanser.,"This was ok. If your a kid or a man who has problems submitting to a diligent skincare routine and all you need is simple a cleanser for you shower then you should be happy. I liked the smell -spa-ish, not floral or fruity."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,"Love this cleanser, it has truly helped minimize my breakouts and I can tell, because when I’m lazy and don’t wash my face with it for two days I break out a lot. 

The consistency is amazing, it’s very gel like and easy to use."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,not the best out there,"nothing super special! i have super oily and acne prone skin, didn’t stop shine or prevent new pimples so i probably won’t repurchase:( also the way it’s formatted makes it leak quite often"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Didn’t notice 1 difference after 6+ months of use,"While I’m a fan of the brand, this particular cleanser didn’t ever flush out my pores or make my skin feel nearly as clean as their other incredible cleanser, the Pure Skin Cleanser. This one with red clay unfortunately did not unclog my pores, it more so just helped wash my face, which just about any cleanser really can do. I highly recommend their other cleanser as mentioned before, for a really clean, fresh-faced feel. Cant go wrong with that one."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,"This is my go-to cleanser. I still have acne, and this helps lessen my breakouts without being harsh."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,"I have combination skin and this is the best cleanser I have found that helps combat the oiliness in my t-zone and occasional dry patches on my cheeks. There is decent amount of product that comes in the tube, washing my face twice a day it usually lasts two months"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,great face wash to remove makeup,"Great face wash! I have combination skin & at 44 started to see enlarging pores.  I’ve tried other face washes with AHA & other ingredients for exfoliating, but didn’t see much of a difference.  I only use this one at night, and over the last 2-3 weeks, I can see a change.  It leaves my skins clean without feeling stripped. Will definitely continue to use & but again."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Fast Acting,"I have sensitive, combination skin that is prone breakouts. I have been using this for half a week now and I was in the middle of a bad breakout, it completely stopped the breakout from getting worse and is helping to reduce the inflammation. I am now pairing this product with the bha spot treatment and am very optimistic for the outcome. 

It is slightly drying just make sure that you are using a moisturizer with it and you will be good! I also live in a very dry city."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,"Love this product, I’ve bought it 3 times now! I find it gets rid of break outs faster and reduces redness from them. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because it didn’t do much for blackheads like it said it would on the FAB website. Still a great product though and I’ll keep repurchasing it!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,I was so disappointed!! This cleanser did not lather. My skin did not feel clean after using it. I will be retiring it!!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Cleared up my acne prone skin. I Highly recommend.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Maybe?,"I really wish this product worked better. It did lessen my acne, but I still aways have clusters of zits all over. The most noticeable thing that wasn’t exactly desirable is that it made my zits “more compact” for a lack of a better term, and therefore more painful"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,"I switched to this recently. This stuff is amazing!! A very little goes a long way, so I can see the tube lasting a long time, and you easily get a really good lather with it. I use it twice a day with Origins' Clear Improvement moisturizer and it's definitely helped to manage my oiliness, and my pores, and get a nasty acne breakout back under control."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Great for sensitive oily/combo skin,"Love this cleanser! It’s perfect for my oily T zone.  Since I started using it my skin looks better.  It doesn’t dry my skin, my pores look smaller, no more acne due to clogged pores.  I have tried so many cleansers on my sensitive skin and by far this one is the best."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,really nice cleanser,"I absolutely love this cleanser. I have very oily skin with lots of pores that need to be cleaned daily and this does all that and more! I've tried so many cleansers and this one has been the best so far. I love that it has clean ingredients and it leaves my skin smooth and clean, and doesn't strip it down. Will be restocking when I'm out."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,"Great for young skin, and mature skin.","Love this cleanser! I am 50, and have combination skin. This cleanser is perfect. It blasts through oil and makeup without being too drying. You do not need to use a lot, and it works really well. I also have very sensitive skin, and this did not cause a reaction. I gave some to my 20 yr old daughter, she loves it as well. Suitable for younger skin as well as mature skin."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,"Gel consistency takes a bit to lather, but spreads well and cleans the face. Doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. It doesn’t quite clear my blemishes though, like I thought it would. But overall, it’s not bad."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,love this,great face cleanser for clearing up problem skin-daughter uses it too
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,good stuff,It seems to be working really well and doing what it says it’ll do
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,The best cleanser,"I’ve gone through so many expensive cleansers, and always end up back to this one. It is the OG cleanser, the best for combination/oily skin. Cleanses so well yet still gentle, doesn’t leave that awful squeaky post soap feeling on your face, keeps breaks out under control."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,This is the most amazing product if you have large pores. My pores are so big they almost look like pin pricks all over my face and this product seriously has made them smaller. It is the only thing that has ever helped. If you have big pores seriously try this.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,holy grail,"i’ve been using this cleanser for a few months and i love it so much. i just repurchased my second bottle. it smells good, foams up well, and does a great job of keeping my skin clear and clean!! i have oily, acne prone skin and this doesn’t make me break out at all. it’s taken me so long to find a holy grail cleanser but i’ve finally found it! definitely recommend!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,BEST cleanser ever,I absolutely LOVE this cleanser. I’ve tried so many different cleansers in the past few years from $20-100+ and this one takes the cake. The price itself is a huge selling point and the amount of product you need per usage is very minimal. One bottle will last a few months. It gets deep into the skin and does it job! I’ve never used a better cleaner. Highly recommend!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Not for me personally,"This one was a big NO for me. I waited to write a review until I used the whole bottle. First, never drop this product... I did on accident and the whole cap broke in half and it’s such a smooth cleanser it was pouring out. I do feel like it didn’t clean out my pours. I broke out. I was using two other cleansers before I used this one and it was just not cleaning anything left over. I also used the moisturizer from this brand and it probably made me break out too. I feel like this cleanser is very gentle. I do feel like the red clay provided a little glow but nothing dramatically different.  Not a huge scent at all did notice in the product it was sparkly. Personally I didn’t like that. It was red for those wondering. Sometimes I felt the oil still on my face which made me use more than two cleansers just to make sure. In the end I still felt like I had a layer of dirt on my face. I hated wearing makeup and using this product cause I just felt like it didn’t help at all. I would think no makeup and this cleanser would be better. But This is my personal opinion I tried it because of the red clay and it did little to nothing the brightness in your skin fades two hours after you wash your face. Honestly if you want to try it go for it my skin is completely different (combination, dry around nostrils, eyes, cheeks, and , oily t-zone).  I would recommend this to some that’s more dry in skin and doesn’t break out. But I’m it a dermatologist so... try it out if you like it I’m happy it works for someone. It just didn’t for me. Hope this helped!:)"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Decent cleanser,Bought it to reduce the appearance of pores but I havent seen much changes. But I still like it as a cleanser.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Not a Fan,"I’m not sure I would ever get this for anyone.. it feels great once it’s rinsed off for sure, BUT I guess it’s the red clay that it this weird liquid rubber texture? Not entirely sure if it’s done anything for my skin bc I don’t feel like it’s done anything like the Black Charcoal cleanser <- WHICH I LOVE!!! But I wouldn’t get this again it feels EXACTLY like the face mask which also has the Red Clay in it."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Works wonders for me!,"I have been using this for about a week and have already noticed improvements in my skin! I have been a First Aid Beauty user for almost two years and have been yet to be let down. This product was the extra little push my skin needed and has been helping to clear up areas of my face I’ve been struggling with for years. This will definitely be a go to from now on. My skin has a tendency of drying out especially with products suggested for acne, I haven’t noticed any dryness and am so happy with the results!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,love!!,i lovvveeeee this product!! it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin in the slightest bit and it keeps my oiliness and acne away all day long. i use this morning and night and my skin has never looked better!! only been using it for a few weeks but as of right now 5 stars!!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Somewhat washes off makeup and leaves my skin super super dry. My skin is naturally prone to being more dry and this product makes it so much worse.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,We are LOVING it!,"I actually purchased this for my boyfriend. He has an oily T-zone, and breaks out like a mad man when stressed out. Mainly around his jaw line area. He has been using this and OMG! His skin is glowing! Yes, he still breaks out, but not as bad! Maybe a third the amount as before. I will make him keep using this for a while and see where it goes!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Horrible!! Made me break out in the weirdest places that I’ve never had issues with
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Yep Yep Yep,"I have and will continue to repurchase this product. I am a fan of most First Aid Beauty products, but this one is by far my favorite. It have supremely sensitive skin and have to be VERY careful about the products I introduce, as I risk flaring up acne or eczema or redness or... the list goes on. This product is both gentle and powerful! It removes dirt and grime, targeting pores, all the while keeping your skin integrity intact - leaving you with clean, soft, rebounding skin rather than that tight and dry feeling a lot of clay cleansers cause. A little goes a long way, so this product lasts a while which makes the price point worth it for me. I recommend this to everyone!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,I bought this cleanser around a month back. I like the formulation and it did work for my skin however the tube is almost half done and for the price I bought it at it's not the best. I was expecting so much more from first aid beauty since everyone kept raving about it. I don't think I'd be buying the product again.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Mica Powder,I would give this a higher review but I was very disappointed to find that it contained mica and was mildly glittery. This didn’t stay on my skin and the cleanser did as intended but mica powder in a cleanser is a completely unnecessary ingredient and really cheapens the product. I have no idea why the decision to add mica to the product was made as it isn’t a makeup item. The cleanser did feel really good and gave my skin a needed deep clean to remove built up makeup and other skincare products. You can kinda see the sheen of the mica powder in the photo I gave but it’s much more evident in person.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Great for all skin types,One of the Sephora employees recommended this to me while I was shopping and I am so happy she did! I use this every other day and it helps control my breakouts. Great for sensitive skin too!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Good... Not Great.,Product was definitely worth the price. Really disliked the scent but was super happy knowing I was using a clean product. It seemed to help with my acne at first (I used the Red Clay Exfoliant Pads as well). After using the product for a while I found that it didn’t have the same effects long term. Been using since January and it’s not May. Still have some product left and I use it 2 times daily. Definitely a good amount of product for what you’re paying. Would potentially buy again but looking to try new things to see what works for me.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Clears my acne in 2 days,This along with the salicylic pads clear up my acne in 2 days. Along with the ordinary alpha arbutin to tackle scaring before it can happen.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,meh,"First aid beauty is hit or miss for me, and this cleanser just wasn’t it. My skin definitely purged at the start of use, a lot of congestion and papules. It calmed down after some consistent use but I wouldn’t call it a holy grail product. For the price, you can do much better in my opinion"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Great value for sensitive skin,"This is my go-to facewash for getting all the dirt and grime without overdrying or irritating. I got turned onto FAB when my skin was super sensitive during pregnancy. I highly recommend this line for sensitive skin. They are all a good value, too. Good price and it lasts a long time."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,This gel cleanser really does the job and does a deep clean of my skin. I have combination skin which I do not take care of often. This cleanser really tugs out the dirt and leaves my skin feeling clean without being abrasive.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,buy this,Best face wash I won’t ever go back. Cleans your skin nicely without drying out your face. Cleared up my skin concerns right away
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Great for Oily Skin,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I've been using this cleanser for over 5 years and I still love it! I have very oily skin, and this cleaner usually gets rid of all that oil and dirt in one wash without stripping my skin."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,If Supreme Made A Red Cleanser,Cleans like no other! Cleared my poor congested pores after one use. It keeps getting better.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,The formulation of this cleanser is odd. It’s thick and sort of gel like but it never gets foamy or creamy. You put it on your face and it just kind of feels like lube. Also a little hard to wash off. Haven’t noticed any huge changes in my skin either. Won’t re purchase.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,"Works great, but not a miracle product","Very good cleanser for oily or acne prone skin, and at a great price point compared to a lot of the other comparable moisturizers. Not a miracle product but works for keeping my acne at bay with the exception or stubborn hormonal acne. Will continue to purchase."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Worth It,My face feels softer after I used it. My acne definitely starts to heal faster after using this product compared to previous products that I used before. I just purchased another one!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,Canada,Live changer,I have sensitive acne prone oily skin and this cleanser is the most perfect for my skin! It has significantly improved my skin in 2 weeks and i’ve never been so happy with a cleanser! I’ve really noticed a change in my skin. This doesn’t dry my skin out at all and doesn’t leave my skin feeling stripped!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Best thing ever.,LOVE THIS CLEANSER. I love this so much the texture is great and I use it everyday
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Love it !!,At first I thought it was just a normal cleanser that didn’t do much but after a while I noticed my blemishes reducing and it leaves my skin so soft. I have combination skin and prone to breakouts but as long as you use it everyday you should see results!! I’m running out and will buy a new one.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Pure Skin Deep Cleanser With Red Clay,USA,Not for me,"It may have just been how this cleanser worked on my skin (as there are so many positive reviews), but I did not get a deep cleanse and it left something of a film after I rinsed it off. I ended up breaking out on my forehead (where I never really break out) and my blackheads got worse. Would not recommend to someone in a humid climate or acneic skin."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Miss,"This is the best cleansing oil ever! I had sensitive acne-prone skin, this product didn’t cause me break-up at all. It works well to remove my make up and hope it won’t discontinue."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Cleansing Oil,Canada,"Yes, just YES amazing oil","I bought this elsewhere initially a while a ago, as it wasn't available here but it is one of the best cleaning oils I've tried and the scent is settle and SO good. If they ever make detergent, I'd want my bedsheets to smell like this oil!"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Cleansing Oil,Singapore,love the smell! ,I love the smell! It’s nice to wind down and clean off my makeup at the end of the day with something nice smelling. It does feel a bit oily hence dropping 1 star but I won’t mind repurchasing during sales simply because it cleans well and smell great!
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Cleansing Oil,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Cleansing Oil,"This stuff takes off foundation and sunscreen really easily and is good for oil pulling too. It smells like honey but isn’t overpowering, and it’s actually quite pleasant. It doesn’t burn or irritate my eyes at all but it also barely removes any waterproof mascara. I have to put in way more effort and it still doesn’t remove the majority of it. For the price, I would have expected it to do a better job with the eye makeup. Took off a star for each reason. This would be a really nice, luxury purchase for someone who wears minimal or no makeup but it’s just not right for me."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Cleansing Oil,Canada,Best cleansing oil ever!,"I use this cleansing oil  as the first step of my cleansing routine (before the shower). It removes ALL makeup, even waterproof eyeliner & lip ink. Leaves the skin super clean & super smooth. Plus, the smell is amazing!"
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Canada,The perfect cleanser,"I use the Ultracalming Cleanser as the second step in my nightly double-cleanse routine. I love that this cleanser is non-foaming, non-drying and leaves my skin feeling clean without leaving it parched.  Although the price point is high, it's definitely worth the investment."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,great value and it works!,"I love the ultra calming line from Dermalogica. I have red, often inflamed from breakout prone skin and have noticed immediate results with the following skin care routine and products: 

1. Pre-cleanse 
2. Ultra Calming Cleanser 
3. Daily Exfoliant (for extra support) 
4. Toner Spray (absolutely love this step) 
5. Ultra calming Serum 
6. Ultra calming Gel Moisturizer 

It’s an expensive routine, but I am happy I made the investment! 

Plus the cleanser is great size for the cost. It’s my second time purchasing!"
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Loyal Customer; Great for Rosacea,"I’ve been using this cleanser for about a decade because it is so gentle on my sensitive skin. I have rosacea and have never felt any burning or tingling from using this product, unlike many other cleansers on the market, even ones that are marketed as suitable for sensitive skin."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Canada,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,"One of the best daily cleansers from men too. The texture is truly unique and a joy to use.

5/5 for sure"
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,SO calming,"I love this cleanser!!! I have extremely sensitive skin with acne and fungal acne. Doesn't make me break out, or leave my skin feeling super tight and dry after cleansing. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it doesn't remove eye makeup well, definitely need a makeup remover when wearing eye makeup."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Canada,Not a fan,"I was so hopeful for this. I have a ton of dermalogica products and hadn’t tried a cleanser. I didn’t like that it didn’t lather, it felt like I had to use more than needed. It also made me break out really bad. I’m grateful to be blessed with good skin, but after using this I broke out in 4 big pimples and it was awful."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,"I like this cleanser, it doesn’t dry out or irritate my skin. Leaves my skin feeling clean without feeling harsh. I have redness and normal/dry sensitive skin. Doesn’t do well as a make up remover so I have to make sure to remove make up beforehand."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Canada,Amazing,"I have EXTREMELY sensitive and reactive skin. I have tried countless products with no luck. This have been an absolute life saver for me. My skin does not feel stripped at all, no reaction or dryness. Worth the money!"
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Canada,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,"It didn’t dry out my skin or cause irritant however it didn’t do a good job removing makeup and I didn’t like the texture when applied to my skin.  I also dispensers like this, no way to lock it after opening and seemed to dispense way more than I needed."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Singapore,Effective cleanser,Does its job well and remove all traces of make up without stripping the skin from moisture. Does not make my face feel dry unlike other cleansers. Will purchase again.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,MUST READ!!!,"I was using a much harsher cleanser that caused my skin to have an allergic reaction and feel over-processed. I frantically searched for a new cleanser that I could use to have a calming effect, and this did the trick!! This cleanser is gentle on your face and neck. It does require a minimum of two washes to get your face clean when wearing makeup. However, that is not an issue for me. I always follow up with a toner to get any dirt or oil left behind after cleansing. I believe it is also important to follow up with a moisturizer and SPF for optimal results. I will continue using this product."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,LOVE this product. feels so good on my skin and does not irritate my face
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Canada,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,I purchased the whole Ultra Calming line and I am a huge fan of this cleanser. My skin is very sensitive and it worked great.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Dry,Great for taking off my makeup received for free thank you
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Canada,OBSESSED,LOVE THIS..... I have extremely horrible eczema probed sensitive skin and this cleanser is now my new holy grail cleanser
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Canada,So gentle and redness is gone!!,"LOVE this line of calming products!!  I’ve always struggled with rosacea but I had rhinoplasty about 5 years ago and ever since, my nose is so red ALL the time!!!  This is the first system to take the redness away.  I have an oily t-zone and super dry cheeks and this stuff balances everything out nicely. So happy I have it a try."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Really works,"I'm pregnant and this winter my (usually oily/combo) skin got super dry and cheeks were red and irritated. Used lots of other very gentle face washes (for eczema, no soap etc.) Tried this and haven't had redness since! If wearing mascara or extra makeup need to use a makeup eraser or something extra but for no/light makeup (like tinted moisturizer and concealer) works great."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Canada,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,"A wonderful cleanser for sensitive or dry skin, or both. I prefer this one compare to the special cleansing gel."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Love,"I have used a million cleansers and never really been as happy as I am with this. I think I finally found my forever system. After washing, face felt amazing clean, not striped, and less red."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Canada,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Great for sensitive skin and skin with rosacea.  This is wonderfully soft and non-irritating.  Love this cleanser.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,"Finally...!!! My teenage son have a cleanser that he LOVES. 
With dry, sensitive and with a touch of eczema, my couldn't use just anything. Which was both frustrating for both me and him.
UltraCalming Cleanser did the job."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,"inflammation reducer, contact dermatitis hero",Holy grail of non foaming cleansers! Removes makeup as well but may need to cleanse 2x. I get contact dermatitis frequently and this cleanser stops it in its tracks ! Greatly reduces inflammation
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Has really helped calm down my rosacea. You definitely get a lot of product for the price too.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Canada,Perfection in a Bottle!,"BIG BOTTLE! 250 ml is a HUGE bottle, and came with a great dispenser (tip: only use half a pump to get a pea-sized amount, and that's the perfect amount for the whole face AND your neck and decolletage). I swear a bottle this size lasts me a good 6-10 months as long as I don't over-dispense it!

I can't say enough about this stuff honestly, it's got an amazingly gentle scent (a hint of lavender and other essential oils that aren't in the slightest bit overpowering or nasty like some brands have with their cleansers), it's suuuper gentle on sensitive/sensitized skin that tends to literally crack and split in the winter (especially in the cold/windy weather I like to snowshoe in) and it's even healed a few small scars from that as well alongside the Ultra Calming moisturizers in the same line."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Canada,My holy grail cleanser!,"This is the best cleanser ever! I love that it is super gentle for my sensitive, dehydrated skin. It washes off clean without stripping my skin and doesn’t leave any kind of residue or oily film that some cleansers do. I’ve been using this for over a year now. Wish it would be a little cheaper, seems a lot for a cleanser."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Canada,great product,"This cleanser is very mild but efficient. I've used other dermalogica cleansers before but they were very drying for my skin so I was biased when I was given a sample of this; It was a game changer. I have adult acne prone skin (the occasional topical breakout) and this really reliefs any irritation. It is moisturizing. I don't use makeup often but the precleanse and this in combination do the job. As others have suggested it's not a bad idea to alternate with a ""tougher"" cleanser. It provides excellent treatment, however, if followed by an exfoliant or other specialized treatment (acids etc)."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Broke me out,I have oily skin and this cleanser broke me out for days. It would not go away until I decided to just use my dove bar to wash my face instead. I think it was just too light and not really doing a good job at cleaning my oily skin.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Pretty good,This is a really good gentle cleanser. Leaves my face feeling refreshed.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Singapore,Dermalogica Ultra-calming cleanser,My skin is turning dry with age. Dermalogica ultracalming cleanser is a gentle gel cleanser that leaves my skin soft & still clean. i use it after DHC cleansing oil to remove my makeup first. i can see myself re-purchasing this product.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Best cleanser for sensitive/dry skin!,"This is a godsend for sensitive (& dry) skin! I have extremely sensitive skin—most cleansers/face scrubs I try (even those that claim to be for sensitive skin) result in excessive redness, itching, burning and allergic reactions... And not only can my skin tolerate Dermalogica’s cleanser, but it leaves my skin feel smooth, toned and hydrated."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,The best,Clean &fresh and had my pores so open it was like the wind was in me and my skin was way more smoother after a week
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,"I have oily skin and like this as a morning cleanser, definitely wouldn't use it at the end of the day to get off makeup/end of day grime/etc.  It's a really gentle cleanser and great for sensitive skin.  I know I'll really enjoy this in the colder months coming up when my skin gets dehydrated.  Again, only as a morning cleanser, but even just using something gentle and hydrating in the morning will help a lot!"
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Gentle and kind to skin! I loved the lavender scent of this face wash as I always find lavender calming. I had to give it 4/5 stars only because of the consistency. Personally I prefer a foaming or scrub wash but this one is more like a lotion. Overall it’s a good product and I would use it again.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,"This is one of my new favorite cleansers, I love its formulation and the feeling that it leaves my skin, radiant and hydrated, they need it in their facial care"
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Amazing product,Love this product it is so clean and fresh feeling its crazy but I love it may fiancee Love's its so its a win win for me thank you so much love the product
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,I love the whole entire ultra calming line! I’ve struggled with acne forever. I’m on prescriptions from the dermatologist and now my acne is gone but to help calm/balance my skin I use this and it’s amazing. It’s super gentle and makes my skin feel clean
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Beautiful Smell!!,I love the lavender smell!! However I didn’t like that it felt like I was putting lotion on. The consistency wasn’t my personal favorite and I didn’t feel much of a difference after using it. I also like that it’s best on sensitive skin and that you can wipe off instead of washing off. I’m more into foaming type of cleansers. But overall I’d buy and recommend.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,This is it!,"I have very sensitive skin, so it's hard for me to find a good cleanser that doesn't leave my face extremely red and dry when I'm done washing my face. I was looking for a cleanser that wasn't going to harm my skin and that would hopefully work for me. I've tried quite a few drugstore products that are for ""sensitive skin"" and nothing helped. This cleanser though!! My face isn't red when I'm done washing it, and it leaves my skin feeling so soft! I've only had it for a few days, but I've already noticed the difference. It is gentle on my skin and best of all, no more redness or dryness in the first steps of my day! It really was a struggle to find something good that worked for me. So far, this cleanser is working amazingly!"
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,I have super sensitive and dry skin so I was beyond excited to try this product! Upon application it felt cooling and is definitely a gentle cleanser more useful for everyday routine on its own and then in combination with a heavier duty sensitive skin makeup remover or micellar water for makeup/ lots of sunscreen days! Did not cause as much irritation as some other “sensitive skin” cleansers I’ve used which is another plus!
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Works great!,"When i first used it, it felt like i wasn't using anything at all. I didn't have any face reactions at all compared to other products I've used. It left my skin feeling really great i loved it"
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Highly recommend this for oily and acne-prone skin,"I have very sensitive acne-prone skin. I feel like this instantly calmed the redness and helped with some of the oilness as well. I really love this product and it does not smell like medicine, but has the properties to heal your skin."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,"I love Dermalogica to begin with but this cleanser is like heaven! 
There's a nice cooling sensation but it's not harsh and doesn't ""burn"" 
I always remove my makeup before cleansing my face but for the sake of trying a new product I did remove my makeup with the product as well and it did great!"
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Effective cleaner for dry sensitive skin,"I have dry sensitive skin & used this for around 4 weeks every other day and i only get one or two minor break outs compared to before, its also nice to help remove makeup as a double cleanser and it hasn't dried my skin out. Once you add water its easy to apply and rinse off so if you're looking for an easy quick product this is great. Its improved my skin & I don't get big breakouts after using makeup anymore too which is awesome"
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,The cleanser was nice cause it didn't leave my skin dry and tight afterwards. I take my make up off before washing my face but this was great for any spots I missed.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Calming effect,Very refreshing! It has a cooling effect on my face. I definitely will purchase when I run out.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,I received this product to review. I use it with the acne cleanser and this really keeps my skin in balance!
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Great cleanser,This product was great! Really loved the way it worked on my skin! I got to try it for free from BzzAgent
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Great for angry skin after wearing masks!,"I really dig this cleanser. I work outdoors in the heat and cold, and the inclusion of a mask has not been kind to my skin. Maskne is no joke! So when I get home, I put a dot of this cleanser on a wash cloth (a little goes a long way). It removes my makeup with ease and leave my skin feeling clean and cool. You know that burning feeling some cleansers give your skin? This cleanser will help you forget it. But it doesn’t sacrifice power for comfort, and your skin will be free of makeup after washing. It’s got a mid-price point compared to other cleansers, but I find that it works just as well as higher end products. I have already recommended it to some of my skincare-conscious friends and even a couple who have complained about the mask-ne that’s rampant these days. I received a bottle as a free sample but definitely plan to purchase after I run out."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Good Cleanser,I have super flaky skin and I got this free and I tried it. What I like about is it that it feels so lightweight and silky. I used it when I take a bath and it really takes just a little for my whole face and when I get out of the shower my face doesn’t feel dried out or tight like some. I always like that I don’t necessarily need water it’s wet enough that I can use it without water and wipe it out easily. My skin feels smooth after I use it. I’d totally recommend
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,I have dry skin so when trying a new cleanser I pay attention to how my face feels after the wash. This cleanser didn't leave my skin feeling stripped (though its not the most hydrating cleanser I have either). It's gentle so I oil cleansed as a first step when wearing sunscreen or makeup.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,I wanted to like this so bad,"I love Dermalogica products. I've used a few before and each has been practically life changing. This cleanser was disappointing. I have super sensitive skin, so I was excited about the idea of a gentle cleanser but this is just too gentle. Cotton pads with toner always come away dirty and my face never feels clean. Even when I don't wear makeup and don't go to the gym, this cleanser still doesn't work for me. I do like that the cleanser is unscented, but that's the only pro for me."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Good cleanser,"I received this free, I love it my face looks so calm and smooth after applying, I apply this at night but some times in the mornings. The difference between this and other cleansers are that with this after I wash my face and apply my foundation looks more healthier your face , and the foundation looks better. I recommend this and yes I will buy it."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,"I have been using this face wash for about a month now and I love it because it’s so gentle on my skin! It doesn’t dry out my skin after I wash my face, but I do use it in a double cleansing system as It doesn’t completely take off my makeup and clean my skin on its own."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,The Best facial cleanser,"I love this product and how it went onto my face so smooth, the best part about this is the quality of this product. I was looking for a really good facial cleanser and this did the job perfectly. My face is a mixture of oily and dry and this didn't make it more of one or the other."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,I looooove this product! it does such a great job of cleansing my skin without leaving it dry or over washed!!
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Feels great on face,I love the way this feels on my face after I use it! It makes my face so soft. After I put it on it does not feel heavy or sticky at all. It has a gel consistency and is very gentle on my sensitive skin. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a gentle cleansing for their face with mild dirt/makeup exposure.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Is good.,Very gentle and cleanses skin without leaving my skin feeling stripped or dry. The texture is very soothing and easily rubs on your face without irritating. 
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Really cleans and great for sensitive skin!!,"I absolutely love this cleanser from Dermalogica. It’s from the Ultracalming line from them and it’s amazing for sensitive prone skin. You can even use it without water by cleansing with dime- quarter size amount using circular motions, then simply wipe off with dry cloth if you are too sensitive to use water (I.e after surgery or cosmetic tattoo). This cleanser removes all makeup and impurities without stripping the natural skin barrier, keeping your face clean and healthy. Remember to double cleanse at night! I would 10/10 recommend this to a friend."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Cleans your face well. Leaves you feeling refreshed. I have red sensitive skin especially after showers and this helped me.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Recommend only for those with normal skin,"I received this product free through Bzzagent. I was looking for a new cleanser and luckily got chosen to review this product. I have heard really great things about this brand, so I was excited to try. However, I dont think this product is any better than ones I have previously tried. I have a very oily nose/chin and my forehead is very dry. My face feels fine immediately after using, but not long after my face is back to being pily/dry. It is gentle enough for my sensitive skin though. Long story short,  I think I would only reccomend if you have normal skin."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Good for sensitive skin,"I tried it and liked it at some point. Comparing to other brands it is really good for sensitive skin, however I would like it more if after using it my skin would feel more moisture. 
Overall I would buy it again and recommend it."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Smells amazing,"I have been using this product consistently for about 2 weeks now- prior to this, I was using Cetaphil gentle cleanser as my skin is extremely sensitive to products and often times, products break me out. I love the smell of this cleanser- it’s a light lavender smell. The texture is very gentle- I do not feel like it removes makeup well, but I would say that it does a good job of cleansing bare skin. The product claims that you can just wipe it off without having to use water- I personally do not like to use it in this way, as I feel like it leaves my skin feeling a bit filmy. I do think it’s comparable to the Cetaphil cleanser- I feel like my skin does fair better with Cetaphil possibly due to added fragrance in the Dermalogica. I would like to use this product a bit longer before deciding if I would purchase this on my own- I do like it, but I also feel like there are more affordable brands that are just as effective."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Gentle yet effective cleansing for sensitive skin!,"Disclaimer: I received this free from Bzzagent for testing purposes but the opinions expressed remain 100% my own honest thoughts. I recently was looking for a new cleanser to try since I usually change my skincare products according to the season. Since I have very dry and sensitive skin that is acne prone during the fall season I enjoy incorporating gentle cleansers that are also need them effective in cleaning throughly. Unfortunately many cleansers that i've tried in the past tend to leave my face either too tight/completely stripped of all oils or are too greasy even for my super dry skin. Thankfully I was able to try this amazing product by Dermalogica and find my perfect medium! I had always heard so many good things about the brand but didn't know where to start so this has definitely made me understand all the hype. This cleanser has quickly become a must have even for sensitive skin like mine. It doesn't irritate my skin at all. My skin feels clean after cleansing my face with this product without feeling tight or peeling like I did with other cleansers which only further aggravated my redness and eczema. The lavender scent is also wonderful so it really feels like a spa experience and creates the perfect clean slate for my effective skincare products that come next to be really absorbed well without any oilyness or film left behind which I really appreciate! Love that it is soap free and ph-balanced to protect the skin's natural moisture barrier. Overall I also have noticed less redness and acne spots due to it's lightweight texture and also effective deep cleaning. This is a product that I would consider worth investing in and I will definitely continue using it as long as they sell it! 
Thanks for taking the time to read my review! Hope you have a wonderful day!"
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Canada,best cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love this cleanser, I first started using it when I was in school for esthetics and it really helped my skin, got less breakouts, my skin was less red, and felt amazing on my skin. perfect for sensitive skin. would definity recommend."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Pleased,I got this as a free trial from Bzzagent. I wasn't expecting it to go all that great since I don't have the best of luck with play saucers but I was surprised it works really well on my skin which can be very picky sometimes and made me feel clean without being overly dry which is a major concern that I have. It smelled pretty good andFelt really nice on my skin I would recommend this to anybody I believe everybody should try a really nice face wash at least once in their life. I would definitely buy this for myself anytime
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Unstoppable,"Let me start by saying that 1) I have eczema so my skin is very dry and very sensitive and 2) I have (had!) a lot of blackheads one my chin, nose, and between my eyebrows... 

So: for me to have found a product that doesn’t hurt my skin, doesn’t dry me out, doesn’t irritate me, doesn’t make me have a flare up... that’s amazing. I always use a scent free wash and I really thought I was actually washing my face... until I tried this Ultracalming Cleanser by Dermalogica. You have never experienced a truly clean face until you’ve tried this cleanser. It’s hard to explain because you think you wash your face with whatever product you usually use, but the ultracalming cleanser is different. I have only been using this product for about 3 weeks, but I can honestly say that 80% of my blackheads are gone. 

When I started using the Dermalogica UltraCalming Cleanser I stopped using my regular facewash as well as my blackhead wash and blackhead mask. I wanted to make sure my skin wouldn’t react to a new product so I wanted to use it by itself to really be sure my eczema skin would be fine with it. And WOW. I know this cleanser isn’t advertised for blackheads, but I have never used anything more effective. I didn’t even intentionally use it for blackheads I just thought it would be a normal face wash... but I can never go back. I really mean it when I say my face has never been cleaner. I was getting a lot of maskne from wearing a face mask and it’s all gone. Not only is the maskne gone, but I’m not getting any new pimples. 

I really thought this Ultracalming cleanser would be comparable to my usual cetaphil or cerave facewash but they’re not even in the same ball back. It was nice that my old facewash wasn’t irritating me at all but I think it wasn’t actually washing my face... it wasn’t doing anything for me other than NOT irritating my skin. 

If you want to combat maskne, acne, blackheads, wash your make up off...anything; Get the Dermalogica Ultracalming cleanser"
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,This product reminded me how much I love Dermalogica. It is very gentle on the skin and the fact that it can be wiped off is a nice touch. It's a lovely cream/gel texture that cleaned my skin without leaving my skin feeling tight. No fragrance or extra just a good simple gentle product.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,I got this as a free sample from BzzAgent and I love that if I’m traveling I can just wipe it off with a soft cloth. It works really well with my sensitive skin as well. I would definitely buy it once I’m out of my sample.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Clean,I received this complimentary from BzzAgent and it’s a good cleanser. It has no fragrance and seems great for sensitive skin. I do prefer a cleanser that lathers though.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,Has definitely helped with break outs and smells absolutely amazing! I have combo skin and has really helped with my oily spots but hasn't helped much with my dryer spots. All around I love it and use it daily!!!
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Worth it!!,"I absolutely loved this. I have dry, acne toned skin and it actually helped better than my neutragena facial wash. I highly recommend!!!"
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Clean,I received this product for free from BzzAgent. All opinions are my own. I was skeptical at first because of the texture of this face wash but my sensitive acne prone skin has never felt softer. I love how gentle it is on my skin and the fact that my oily skin doesn’t feel oily right after using this product which is a huge plus for me!
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Pretty decent,I’m not sure how I feel about this product. Maybe it’s just a mental thing for I like cleansers that lather. My skin does feel light after use. Not my favorite but not this worst.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Nice!,I love this cleanser! Super great on sensitive skin but not too heavy.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Great for sensitive skin!,I have sensitive skin and this serum has helped calm my redness. The serum gives a hydrating boost to my current dry skin. I love using this before applying makeup because it’s smooths my face and allows my foundation to blend flawlessly. Using the serum at night helps me wake up to soft and smooth skin.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Would buy again,I apologize in the delay for my review. When I started the product I was actually on my period and was breaking out like crazy. I didn’t notice a difference till after I got off my period. My skin seems smoother and my skin tone is pretty even. My pores it didn’t help much and with makeup I felt like I had to use a lot to get it off. Overall it’s a cool product because you can wash without water but my skin has been super dry lately and I didn’t see a big difference hydration wise. I do feel this is a good product and I would be willing to try it again to see if a longer duration makes a bigger difference.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,"This face wash is so gentle. It is a gel and it didn't feel like other face washes that leave my face feeling dry and irritated. I really like that light scent, too. It's very calming especially before bedtime. I also love that you only need a tiny squirt. A little goes a long way! 

My one and only issue with this product is that I find the price to be a little higher than what I would prefer to pay for a face wash."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Great product,I receive a free sample from BzzAgent. I have to say I love the product. I have very oily skin and a lot of products leave it even more oily except this one. It actually made my skin soft and smooth.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Soft skin!,I tried Dermalogica's Ultracalming Cleanser for free as part of the BzzAgent sampling program. I was happy with the product - it kept my skin clear and also incredibly soft. I also enjoy the minimalist packaging design.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Eyebrows,I tried this product over a period of a week and a half. I waited until after my period had ended in order to give this a fighting chance and I'm so happy I did! At first I was a little disappointed because my eyebrows were still dirty/oily after I'd dried my face. Of course the second day I realized I just needed to rub it in circular motions and everything turned out fine. There aren't very many products I can use to cleanse my face so I'm so happy that this product works so well for my sensitive-combination skin. The only downside is that it does smell like I am applying craft glue haha.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Perfect,I received this as a sample. I have oily skin and I love this product. I feel my face clean and smooth. I highly recommend this product.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Decent Cleanser,"As a skincare junkie, this product was different compared to any product I’ve tried before. The consistency was a change but my skin really seemed to like it upon application. It left my skin feeling soft but not necessarily feeling super clean. When used with a facial brush, I did not feel that deep clean sensation. I think this product is best for a quick cleanse or a second cleanse of the face. This brand tends to run on the pricier side and most of my current cleansers are a little bit more affordable and practical for me. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a gentle cleanser that will calm your face or if you travel a lot and want something quick to clean your face with. I didn’t see any dramatic improvements to my face that would make me want to buy this product and keep it in my daily rotation."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Great product!,I received this product for free to sample and leave an honest review. I have never used dermalogica before but i LOVED this cleanser. It does not bother my sensitive skin at all and leaves my face feeling fresh!
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,I received this as a sample and I really enjoyed it. My face feels really soft. My blemishes went away. I have awfully dry skin. With having to wear masks all the time it’s really helped with that also. The smell is wonderful. It’s very relaxing. I would buy this again but it’s kinda pricey.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Best bang for the buck.,"I fell in love with this product. I’ve used many products, but this one is so gentle and great for sensitive skin, I was speechless. With this pandemic going on, this has been wonderful with helping control my maskne. It’s so gentle and makes your skin feel so soft. I recommend this product 100% to anyone and everyone. I actually went out and bought other products to try and they have no disappointed!"
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Miracle in a Bottle,My face has been broken out from the neverending mask wearing. Once I started using Sephora's Ultracalming Cleanser all that seemed to melt away over night. Within three days of using this stuff (morning and night) my face was back to normal. Now my face is blemish free and so soft and smooth!
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Perfect for dry skin,I switch face cleansers alot. Alot leave my skin feeling dry and tight. This one however did not. My face felt so smooth afterwards. It actually made my face feel clean. I  would absolutely pay full price for more of this. It's worth it and you get alot out of it I luckily received the first bottle for testing purposes.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,"I received this product as a sample, but I would start by saying I would purchase again. Although pricey, it’s a large bottle. It smells great and feels great. It’s gentle and soft. One of the things that impressed me the most was it’s ability to be used without water. With his ya cotton pad. While I haven’t used it like that yet, I feel like it would do a good job."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,"This cleanser made my skin feel calm and smooth and did a great job making my skin feel clean! I love it almost as much as my usual cleanser, I might be making a switch in the near future!"
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,I love dermalogica and love this product. It’s perfect for my sensitive skin and I can smell a hint of lavender in it. It’s much more gentle on my skin than other cleansers.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Great product,"I received this product for free to review and to give my honest opinion of. I must say, I am thoroughly impressed.  I have extremely sensitive dry skin and most cleansers leave my face feeling tight and stripped.  This one does not.  It doesn’t lather which makes it that much more soothing.  Every time I use it, it feels like I am in a spa.  My skin feels clean, hydrated and plumped every time."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Love !,I truly liked this product it was my first time trying this brand & will keep purchasing. The thing that I most liked is that it didn’t leave my skin feeling tight. My skin felt fresh and I loved the subtle lavender scent. The only thing I sort of disliked is that it doesn’t get soapy it’s more like a gel/lotion feel.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. It is so great. It cleans your skin so well. Best product I have used.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Ultracalming™ Cleanser,I have red sensitive skin it sometimes even feels warm to the touch. This stuff is amazing. It feels cool going onto the skin. I get that clean feeling without out the dry tight feeling afterwards.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,This is a game changer!,"I love this cleanser! It’s amazing how using it for only a few weeks my skin looks the best it ever has! It does not dry your skin out. It leaves a nice beautiful glow! Goes on smoothly. Combats redness, has helped clear up my skin a ton, and smells amazing!! I definitely recommend this to anyone. As a former esthetician, this cleanser is one of my top 5!"
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Awesome product,I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I really enjoy this facial cleaner it has a nice scent and is gentle on your skin I would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin and even oily skin. It leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed without drying you out.
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Must Have Cleanser for Combatting Redness!,"I have always loved and trusted the Dermatological brand. They consistently create high quality products that target the needs of their users. They also strive for using only the most important and beneficial ingredients possible. Dermatologica’s Ultracalming Cleanser is no different! It foams great, which always makes me feel comfortable knowing it is “working.” It was extremely gentle on my sensitive skin. It really helped minimize the redness I constantly suffer with. I could see a noticeable difference after the first use! I can’t go a day without my Dermatologica Ultracalming Cleanser now that I know my skin can look so even. I don’t even stress about using foundation when my cleanser is doing its job!

*I received this product free for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own!"
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Better than I expected,"I received this product in exchange for my honest review. This is the first product I have tried from Dermalogica. I was nervous to try this because of the essential oil ingredients. I have sensitive acne-prone skin that is combo to dry. I was pleased to see that it did not strip my skin and make it more dry. I have been using this cleanser for a few weeks now and I haven't noticed my skin having a reaction to the fragrance. Although I did not experience a bad reaction, I would be cautious using this product if you are sensitive to fragrance. I would recommend this cleanser."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Dermalogica Ultra Calming Facial Cleanser,"I absolutely loved this facial cleanser, it was gentle, smooth and creamy. Perfect for my combo skin with dry patches here and there."
DERMALOGICA-Ultracalming™ Cleanser,USA,Big Fan!,"I like how gentle this cleanser is and the smell is so soft and clean smelling!  I like how non-toxic this cleanser is (ranks low on ""ThinkDirty"" app).  The price is appropriate for the amount of product you get as well."
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,Singapore,"It's not bad, but not good","Honestly for my skin (dehydrated with oily T zone) it works the same as any other facial cleanser, so I wouldn't repurchase it as it's on the pricey side."
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,Canada,Love This Cleanser,"This cleanser saved my skin! I have really oily, dehydrated skin and it became quite uncomfortable. Once I started to use this my skin is not as oily but also the tight-skin feel from dehydrated skin went away too!"
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,Singapore,Average,This product is quite average to me.... 
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,Canada,DERMALOGICA Active Clay Cleanser,This product was recommended to me by my facial specialist and I really like the result. It's good for oily skin and it reduces activity on your face due to prebiotic component. So would recommend to people with oily skin type as well as acne prone
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,USA,Best cleanser I’ve ever used!,"Favorite product I own with the intense moisturizer. This changed my combination skin. HIGHLY recommend! It removes impurities, keeps my skin balanced without over drying or oily and reduced pores. Perfect for all seasons/climates. I wouldn’t say it eliminated all my blackheads but I like that it doesn’t make me break out more like a glycolic acid would. I wish it came in a travel size!"
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,Canada,DERMALOGICA Active Clay Cleanser,Very bad smell. I would not recommend it. I ordered it online. Please check it at the store before you buy it.
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,Canada,Was amazing but went bad?,"So this is my second tube of this cleanser. I really loved it and it had a light grapefruity smell to it? Unfortunately, with the second tube, it appears that the product went bad very quickly -- it has a strange smell to it now so I'm afraid to use. For the price, it's really disappointing since I got so little use out of it before it went bad..."
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,USA,Sleeper Hit,"I bought it twice. The first time I wasn't sure if I loved it because it didn't lather much and it felt kind of like I was washing my face with a clay mask lol. But when I ran out the first time and started using something else, my skin noticed. My skin was very flaky and textured and dry. I got little texture bumps on my forehead. So I repurchased it and all that went away. I hadn't noticed the cleanser made such a big difference until I stopped using it. Sleeper hit. 
Don't sleep on this cleanser cuz it doesn't lather a lot and doesn't give you a squeaky dry clean feeling lol, it does it's job. It doesn't strip your skin or dry you out or anything you'd assume a ""clay"" would do. I love it. And when I want to exfoliate I mix in a little of the dermalogica microfoliant in with the cleanser with my hands, because the microfoliant alone is too much for me now too. 10 out of 10."
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,USA,It’s hard to find a good gray clay cleanser…,"My long-time gray clay facial cleanser was discontinued, so I decided to try this Dermalogica one after some research. I like it a lot, it doesn’t leave a gross residue and helps control my hormonal acne. I also use it on my chest and shoulders in the shower. Minus one star bc it is not considered ’Clean at Sephora’ and I prefer to use clean products. So, the ingredients are a concern for me, but I’m sticking with it for now because gray clay is the only thing that seems to consistently help with my breakouts."
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Active Clay Cleanser,This is better than expected. I was hesitant at first because acne is not my main concern but it’s just an amazing overall cleanser than leaves your skin very clean still plumped. Totally worth it.
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,USA,Make the switch to this!!,I was looking to change up my skincare routine. And to start with.... my facial wash. My pores had been looking bigger for awhile so I knew something needed to change. I did my research and finally settled on this. The color looks at first JUST like a clay mask. It has a light subtle lemon scent to it. It’s very clean smelling though. It lathers up with some nice sudsing. After a couple uses I noticed my skin was less oily and my pores had once again started to decline in size (THANK GOODNESS!!) and my skin had an overall healthier appearance. My makeup has been applying and staying in place much better. It’s not harsh on my sensitive skin and didn’t dry my skin out either. I have since tried multiple other Dermogica products and LOVE them too.
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,Canada,favourite cleanser,"if you have oily skin, this is a must have! my skin is severely oily especially around my T zone and nothing has worked as well as this cleanser! thankyou dermalogica!"
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,USA,Goodbye Cystic Acne,This is the first cleanser that has helped with my hormonal acne. I still get small pimples every now and then but after 1 month of use I haven’t received a cystic breakout. This is my new go to!
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Active Clay Cleanser,"I’ve been using the Active Clay Prebiotic Cleanser for several months. My skin is oily and gets even oilier during warmer months. This product leaves my skin looking and feeling incredibly clean without feeling too drying. I’ll use daily during warmer months and less often during colder months when my skin needs hydration. Lastly, and the main purpose of this purchase, I do feel it deeply cleans my pores. I’d definitely recommend and will repurchase, especially for those with oily, acne-prone skin."
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,USA,holy grail product from an OG brand,"I'm very pleased with this cleanser. I was introduced to the brand over 20 years when I was a teen. I have rediscovered it now. It really balanced my skin, and I noticed that I no longer have an oily t-zone anymore. I like that it is not stripping to my skin. After a few days use, I'm clearer and more even textured. I'll definitely make this my permanent cleanser."
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,USA,Game changer,"I’m 57,  with hormonal acne for twenty years. I’ve used every cleanser on the market. This has by far been my favorite. Doesn’t dry and cleans amazingly. Took care of blackheads in days!"
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,USA,DERMALOGICA Active Clay Cleanser,Literally loved it!! I got shingles like 4 months ago and they left my forhead with scars. Within a week of me using this cream you can hardly see my scars. My face looks so much clear as well!!!
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,USA,I’m happy,So far so good I wanted to try something new and my skin was getting kinda oily and this seems to have helped. Some nights I do as it says you can online and let it set for 15 mins and use a mask.
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,USA,mattifying miracle!,"Let me start by saying, I am an esthetician/ makeup artist and have tried many products that claim to control oil. Nothing ever lives up to that claim for me. This cleanser impressed me so much after just 1 use! It makes your skin feel clean and matte but not in an overly-dry way. If you like your skin to feel squeaky clean, you will love this!"
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,Canada,One stop cleansing for the guys.,Bought this for the hubby and his skin looks terrific. He switched from the Special Cleansing Gel and he loves that its doing more in one step. His face feels clean and hydrated. The smell is good too nothing too overwhelming.
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,USA,Take it from me. I never write reviews.,"I was a long time Sunday Riley Ceramic Slip cleanser girl. Then quarantine happened, and I ran out of my face wash. While perusing Sephora one day looking to try a new one, I came across this. I love anything clay-based, and I use Dermalogica’s superfoliant which I love, and so I ordered it. Wow, I’m so glad I did.

This face wash works wonders and my skin looks SO clear. It’s only been less than two weeks. It doesn’t lather too much, but it has this beautiful light creaminess to it. It feels so good on the skin, like very nice and delicate, but still works magic. I’m in love with it, and I’ve gotten SO many compliments from my family about how bright and even my skin looks. I can really notice how clean my pores are. It’s astonishing. So, if you’re on the fence, I really highly recommend this! I don’t ever write reviews, so take it from me! It’s amazing."
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,USA,In Love,"I just received this cleanser and by the second use, it was my #1 cleanser. It did wonders and I love it morning and night."
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,USA,The best cleanser to date!,"Completely in love with this cleanser!  I saw a review by Nikkia Joy and had to try after her rave review and this cleanser did not disappoint.  For oily, textured skin this cleanser is the best product I have used to date!"
DERMALOGICA-Active Clay Cleanser,USA,Male with sensitive dry skin - LOVE,"I've working my way through face cleansing products and this has been the best product I've found so far that doesn't leave my face feeling like it's been stripped. Very gentle cleanser, that has a subtle orange smell (I'm not the best at identifying smells) that I really enjoy."

DOERS OF LONDON-Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Great facial cleanser,I really like this  facial cleanser because gentle to my skin and I really feel comfortable and not drying up my skin. I also like simple and great ingredients will not harm my skin . 
DOERS OF LONDON-Facial Cleanser,Singapore,MS,Product sent was manufactured 3 years ago. The scent of the product was different from what I know it to be. I raised this issue but was told it still has a shelf life of 1 year and case closed. The product and service is undeserving of even one star. 
DOERS OF LONDON-Facial Cleanser,,Mr,"i recently bought this cleanser, i not really it. Using it day and night, but not really clean my face. After rinse with water, my face still feel sticky. Wont repurchase it "
THREE-Balancing Foam R,Singapore,spa experience ,Love the product! The smell is pure and refreshing and it gives me a spa feeling. It is a high grade essential oil smell and reminds me of high end spa. The foam is gentle but does a superb job to cleanse the skin. 
THREE-Balancing Foam R,Singapore,love this!,"This is my third time purchasing this. Have loved using it since I discovered it last year. The scent is very calming, feels like I’m in a spa. Gentle on my skin. Thoroughly cleanses, and it doesn’t make my skin feel tight after use. Really no complains for this so far!"
THREE-Balancing Foam R,Singapore,very good,"Has used other products under this brand -THREE, all is nice and very nature. Just this brand products all got nature sense smell of perfume, if you are ok with it, then it’s quite good and effective products. The face wash is nice and make you feel good after use it. Will consider 2nd buy again. "
THREE-Balancing Foam R,Singapore,lovely scent,This facial foam has a very soothing spa like scent. Kind of lemony and very relaxing. Cleans well and face does not feel dry. This is my 3rd bottle and more to come. 
DRGL-Cleanser Oil Control,Singapore,A little goes a long way,"I think I've used this cleanser now for close to two years (same bottle!) and only now it's getting to the end-tail of product. It lasts a loooong time, so even with handsome price, it's worth every dollar.

As for it's effectiveness, I would say it certainly leaves oily skin feeling clean without the tightness. The scent is subtle so that's great, too."
DRGL-Cleanser Oil Control,Singapore,Good cleansing,Has been getting this repeatedly as it cleanses well and does not strip skin of surface moisture. Skin feels supple and not dehydrated unlike some oil control brand. 
DRGL-Cleanser Oil Control,Singapore,good product,this face wash is suitable for oily skin type. have been using this for a month and my skin feels soft and refresh. recommend those oily skin type to try.

BYBI BEAUTY-Swipe Clean Facial Cleansing Oil and Makeup Remover,Australia,takes off everything! ,"This is sooo gentle, it literally took off stubborn eye makeup so easily all I did was gently spread around in circles and voila! LOVE

Also, the ingredients in this are sooo amazing, I don’t have skin which is highly prone to sensitisation, but this product gave me NO sort of reaction or feeling when using it or after. My face felt clean and as if I didn’t have anything on, ie: it left no residue. Will be purchasing for life"
BYBI BEAUTY-Swipe Clean Facial Cleansing Oil and Makeup Remover,Australia,LOVE,this product is amazing. it is perfect for makeup removal and the product itself lasts very long and smells really good. even through it is a oil it did not break me out
BYBI BEAUTY-Swipe Clean Facial Cleansing Oil and Makeup Remover,Australia,Hydrating clean oil,"My first oil cleansing product for a 2 step cleanse. Removed all my sunscreen, keeping my skin hydrated especially around my eyes, no stinging as i do have sensitive eyes. I now prefer an oil cleanse first instead of micellar water as the oils actually cleaned my skin from all debris. I then follow with a pH balanced cleanser & continue the rest of my skincare routine. I haven't trialed it out with makeup yet. Love the packaging, oil gets poured straight into my hands to be rubbed it, no mess."
BYBI BEAUTY-Swipe Clean Facial Cleansing Oil and Makeup Remover,,Meh,"I purchased this for the purpose of using it for a double cleanser. Doesnt come out of the bottle very nicely, have the rub at your eyes harder that I would expect for an oil cleanser which defeats the purpose. Smells good, but for the price I would not repurchase. "
BYBI BEAUTY-Swipe Clean Facial Cleansing Oil and Makeup Remover,,First time using a cleansing OIL,I tried this for the first time on the weekend and literally got my liner and heavy makeup off in one wash. Just need to massage it in and watch it all break down. Definitely recommend this. Oh and it doesn't sting your eyes. BONUS!
BYBI BEAUTY-Swipe Clean Facial Cleansing Oil and Makeup Remover,,Staple in my 7 Step Routine,"This does everything it says, removes every bit of makeup including eyelash glue, mascara and eyeliner. It's gentle around the eyes and feels so nice on the skin. I use this as part of my two-step cleanse, being the first step, being followed by a gentle foaming cleanser. Definitely can't live without it now that I've found it, and the price is great!"
BYBI BEAUTY-Swipe Clean Facial Cleansing Oil and Makeup Remover,,One of the best that I've tried,It removes my waterproof makeup with ease & most importantly it doesn't sting my eyes. I'd consider purchasing again if there's a sale in the future. A bit pricey for a small bottle but luckily I don't need so much to remove my makeup everytime. 
BYBI BEAUTY-Swipe Clean Facial Cleansing Oil and Makeup Remover,,Best make up remover I've ever used,"I have very sensitive skin and have always had problems with make up removers. This product is the first one that actually works - all traces of mascara, eye shadow, concealer, etc gone! Leaves my skin feeling nourished and soothed. My faith in make up remover has been restored!"
BYBI BEAUTY-Swipe Clean Facial Cleansing Oil and Makeup Remover,,Really good cleanser,"I use this to take of my makeup - works like a dream. Not too oily, doesn't leave the typical film on your skin, no fragrance so doesn't sting the eye. LOVE the packaging too."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Malaysia,does the job,"This cleanser is sooooo similar to the First Aid Beauty cleanser. Super gentle. But would not repurchase, would rather try other cleaners. This didn’t really have miracle effects on my skin."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Singapore,Great Product,"The packaging looks great. The cleanser itself glitters like fairy dust. After using, it made my pores look smaller and my skin smoother. Giving a after powder effect. Definitely recommend."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,I’ve used this for years to remove my makeup and it’s amazing. It gets everything off in a matter of minutes.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Singapore,Good cleanser,"Was expecting the effervescent bubbling but expectation wrong. Good cleanser that does its job, face feels free of dirt and fresh after. The price and size is great too. "
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Singapore,Gentle cleanser,It leaves my skin feeling soft and the wash is very gentle to my skin too. 
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,"Extremely drying, contains lye.","Started using this less than a month ago when I ran out of my other cleaner.  I had this one on hand from Boxycharm and decided to try it.  I've washed my face as usual.  Before my skin dries, I apply hyaluronic acid, facial oils and then my moisturizer.  I usually wake with soft, moisturized skin.  When I awoke the next morning, I had dry, flaky skin about an inch all around my mouth.  I didn't realize it was the GlamGlow Gentlebubble.  I thought it was the dry, warm air from the thermostat I turned on started since the temps dropped in October.  I even added sleep mask to my nighttime routine, hoping that would help.  Not at all.  This is the first liquid cleanser that has ever dried out my combo skin.  If you have dry skin, this is not for you.    On a competitor website, it says this cleanser may cause sun sensitivity and to keep it away from the eyes.  Then I read the ingredients and found sodium hydroxide which is lye.  I only use SLS free ingredients (usually glycerin based) on my face.  Lye literally strips my skin.  The surfactants in this product are gentle but lye is a no-no... at least for me.  Why lye is in a product that has ""gentle"" in the name is beyond me."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Malaysia,Amazing,I heard so many great things about Glamglow and i decided to give it a go. It lathers nicely and i would definitely recommend it. it does not irritates the skin
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,"I love this product so much because of the packaging and clean fragrance. It's very light and refreshing to the face- nice for makeup removal or basic daily cleansing. However, if you want to get rid of deep dirt and bateria or have acne prone skin I'd recommend another cleanser since this one is very gentle. It's very moisturizing and doesn't leave your skin feeling dry or stripped of its essential oils and would be perfect for someone with dry skin."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,need to buy more,Glam glow is great cleanser that is gentle and doesn’t dry me out
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,very drying,I love this brand but was disappointed in this cleanser. It is creamy pearly white and goes on great but has a drying effect. I could feel my skin drawing up after using it.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Canada,It was okay.,"I didn’t see much of a difference. If you’re trying to remove your makeup, you’d be okay with a regular makeup remover."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Malaysia,my HG,this cleanser is my HG now...remove light make up well...not drying my face..it even help to calm mu skin when i had a break out when uaing other cleanser...never gonna change my cleanser ever 
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,"Literally the only cleanser my boyfriend will use. Light, clean scent and gentle bubbles, just like it’s named."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Canada,Nothing special about it.,The product really looked perfect with its packaging. But it burned my skin a lot when I first used it. This went on and it doesn't have any different features beside another cleansers. It was not worth the money I gave.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Canada,Does what it says,I received this in a boxycharm and I find it to be just okay. I’m giving it 3 stars because it does exactly what it says ‘gentle daily cleanser’. It does nothing more or less for me. Would I purchase this again? No. But I don’t mind having it in my shower as my shower cleanser. I need something more hydrating as a daily cleanser due to fry skin. If you are looking for just a simple cleanser that does a minimal job and is gentle than this is a good option!
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,cured acne,I have sensitive dry acne prone skin but this cured my acne since it doesn’t irritate my skin but also cleanses. Almost out of my first tube gonna buy another any day now
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,"Go-to cleanser, removes everything gently","I love a cleanser that removes all the makeup and dirt from my face without causing a skin reaction or stripping, and this one does it."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Canada,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,"As someone who does have sensitive skin, this scent-less gentle cleanser does wonders for my skin & leaves it feeling clean, soft & blemish free!!"
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Canada,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,"The bottle looks sick, but the product wasn’t the best. I had to return I broke out from it."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,"This is the first time I used this product, and the last! I use this daily and every time I use this my face gets really red and really dried out!"
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,I actually love it! It made my acne skin looks so healthy and silky.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Although it smells really clean it was not very effective. It left my skin feeling super moisturized borderline oily but after a weeks use I had some of the most painful acne on my cheeks and chin. I stopped using it and allowed my skin a chance to clear up only to try it again and have the same results. Would not recommend.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,:(,I really wanted to like this but after using it for about a month and a half I have had the worst breakouts I have ever experienced in my life
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Singapore,Too drying,"I have oily skin and this cleanser dries out my skin. Seldom do I find a cleanser as drying as this, after washing my skin feels very tight and it's not a comfortable feeling. "
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Malaysia,extremely gentle,"You only require to use a small amount. This face wash is scentless, extremely gentle for daily use and foams very well. Skin feels soft and smooth and does not feel tight after. "
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Singapore,Ms.,A good cleanser that doubles up as a make up remover. Has a strong fragrance that needs getting used to but does the job well. Does not sting the eyes. The face appears squeaky clean after using it
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Simply Awful.,"Trash. This was by far the worst face wash I’ve ever used. It does absolutely nothing. I decided to give it a chance for a month and day after day I was disappointed. While it doesn’t leave a residue or film, it doesn’t clean my skin. If I use an oil to remove makeup then wash with this there is still oil galore. If I use a micellar water prior to washing with this I’m left going back to remove my mascara with oil. It can’t even remove makeup from makeup brushes."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Canada,Love It,"Love this stuff! Doesn’t have a strong smell, and it cleans well while leaving my skin soft and hydrated. Will definitely buy again!"
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,good,Good! Use it all the time!!! This is my. second. time buying this
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Great for sensitive skin!,"Love this cleanser for my sensitive, combination skin. It doesn't have a strong smell and didn't irritate my skin.  Definitely recommend!"
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,"so far, so good","Purchased this gentle cleanser to use daily and not dry out my skin. Got this brand because I absolutely love Glamglow’s Supermud mask. Since I’ve been home during the pandemic and not applying makeup, I use this twice a day, morning and night. I then put on my favorite vitamin C serum from Naturopathica. So far, so good. No breakout issues. Face feels clean and soft. I didn’t give this a 5 star rating only because on the days I do actually go out and wear foundation and eye makeup, this cleanser doesn’t fully remove everything and therefore have to use a toner (Fresh’s rose water) to wipe off excess dirt."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Is best for combination skin,"This cleanser strips your natural oils 50%, but not as 100% as the GLAMGLOW Supercleanser. This Gentlebubble formula is for combination skin because it doesn't completely dry you out. My face was almost matte but wasn't as sweaky as I would like from their oily skin Supercleanser version. I received this as a sample when checking out at a local Sephora store. This does clean well, but as I said, if you have combination skin, then this will be PERFECT for you. The consistency is thick and creamy, but it doesn't turn bubbly as the name suggests. Nonetheless, it technically did clean my face, so I'm generally happy about it doing *something* for me. However, it didn't make my face completely matte. I would still recommend this because GLAMGLOW always makes high quality products and this could be your next staple."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Singapore,Do nothing,Bought it for the pretty packaging but I better off with my Fresh cleanser. This does nothing special for my skin. Doesnt dry skin out but that’s it. Just compare to other normal cleanser that you can find everywhere with a fraction of the price.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,I don’t know why but this cleanser never really did anything magnificent for me. It’s drying but still doesn’t vibe they squeaky clean feeling.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Malaysia,amazing,"used this as my morning cleanser or as my double cleanser.. its gentle enough, create soft creamy bubble that doesnt strip off and make my face dry feeling after using it. bought it based on review as im looking to switch my cleanser. honestly this works on me, will repurchase again during sales.. a little goes a long way. used a pea sized amount and it last me for few months. and still have half of tube left even been using it everyday..love it!"
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Rápido y efectivo.,Es mi segundo tubo de este desmaquillar. El primero lo recibí por boxycharm y cuando me lo acabe lo volví a comprar. Quita por completo el maquillaje y máscara de pestañas. Y no te deja la piel super reseca. La deja suave y limpia. Soy mamá y siento q es un desmaquillar super rápido.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Malaysia,Just like using tap water. ,Waste of money. Just like using tap water. Do not waste money ladies! Nothing great just a waste of money. Nothing great just a waste of money. Nothing great just a waste of money. Nothing great just a waste of money. 
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Singapore,ms,"Normal cleanser, just a cleanser haha.
No much expectation and it does its job.
Will buy it again if there is promotion as this is just an ordinary cleanser "
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,"Got this by accident still tried drys out my face, the tube is just right"
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,so sad,"Literally did nothing for my skin. I more so used this as a brush and sponge cleanser to get use out of it. The cleanser is beautiful, but I think brands are too focus on making products that look appealing to the eyes rather than making products that work. It was pretty much useless and a waste of money in my books. 

Everyone’s skin is different though. What doesn’t work for me may work for you."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,I love this cleanser,I use this cleanser very often especially when I am wearing makeup and it gets the job done. It leaves my face soft and smooth.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Amazing results for dry skin,"I received this in a monthly box and didn't use it for a long time. My skin is very dry, and my dryness tends to break me out. I normally douse my face in coconut oil before bed and still am a little dry in the morning.

Needless to say, I don't really use cleansers because they are so drying to my face. I finally tried this on a whim when I had my  monthly breakout. I woke up the next day and my skin looked so smooth and clear! Of course it didn't immediately get rid of the breakout, but it did significantly increase the healing time. 

Definitely buying again. I've noticed with continued use it helps keep breakouts at bay."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Malaysia,The Best Cleanser I've Tried So Far,"This cleanser keep my skin hydrated and feel soft. Anyone with sensitive or dry skin should try this, definitely gonna fall in love with it. Plus, a tube lasts for few months, really worth it!"
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Goldilocks Cleanser!,"I received this in a monthly box and was skeptical of it, both because it seemed like a flashy product and because GlamGlow had never really impressed me as a brand. This cleanser changed my mind. I have normal to dry skin, and this cleanser is juuuuust right. It has no discernable scent, foams up nicely, removes every trace of makeup, is gentle (as the name indicates) and leaves my skin feeling cleansed but not stripped. Some have said this is a boring product, or that it does nothing. I think it's a great cleanser that doesn't come with any bells and whistles, but it's fantastic at what it does. I've repurchased several times over."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Canada,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,"Love this cleanser - fragrance free, smooth and creamy, leaves me feeling cleansed without feeling dry or stripped. I alternate between this and a gentle exfoliator. The cute packaging is such a bonus!"
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,leaves my skin feeling like BUTTER. absolutely adore this
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,It's a cleanser,Works as a cleanser and does what needs to be done. I would recommend for oily skin. I have normal skin and made my face feel dry after using.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,my favorite daily cleanser,my friend received this from a monthly subscription and let me use it one night and I fell in love. I had a full face of makeup on and it easily melted everything off while leaving my face feeling clean and hydrated. it foams up really nicely on the skin and comes off easily. I never get that tight feeling after I use this. it has the most subtle clean soapy scent that I really like and it's gentle enough to use daily. I'm on my fourth bottle now!
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Canada,"Not bad, but nothing special","It got the job done, but didn't leave me ooing and ahhing."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Would Not Use Again,I broke out after using this product. I got small bumps all over my forehead that I have never had before. I liked this cleanser until that happened. It did not work for my somewhat acne prone skin.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Breakout galore,This product made me break out!!! Tried this multiple times and it just aggravated my skin!! Only good thing about this product is the cute packaging!
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Not worth it. Does nothing.,"Even though it does leave face quite soft, the reality is that its function should be to cleanse the face, and it does little of that. And for $28 might I add."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Gentle makeup remover/cleanser,"I got this as an add-on in my boxy charm box, and I love it. I have sensitive, oily/combination skin and this doesn't harm it at all. It's very gentle, and cleans even the most stubborn makeup off without stripping your skin of moisture. If you're looking for a makeup remover/cleanser, then this is good for it."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,it’s fine,"This is just okay. It’s a pretty basic cleanser, nothing fancy or gimmicky. This was recommended to me as a good cleanser for dry skin, but I could see this being good for someone with normal to oily skin - it was a tad too drying for me"
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Great cleanser. I have been overworking my skin trying new products so a little dried out and been using this twice a day and it seems to be helping and my skin feels so clean.  and soft
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Canada,Basic,"I think this cleanser would be PERFECT for you if you have sensitive dry skin. It doesn't strip your skin, your skin feels soft and clean afterwards. It doesn't benefit acne oily prone skin. I am keeping for days I use retinol, hydroquinone or glycolics as a gentle cleanser. Overall not for me though."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Singapore,bad.,"i have dry sensitive skin. this cleaneer supoosed to be gentle enough for senstiive skin but nope, totally not gentle at all and i have rashes using this!!! dont even know why they even use glitter in their cleanser n rainbow ish colours?"
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,I love it,This is the best facial cleanser I have ever used and I don’t think I will ever use another except this . It gets my skin feeling super soft and clean . Highly recommended
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Singapore,Underrated Cleanser,"I was not totally convinced when a Sephora makeup artist was raving about this product. But I was looking for something new so, heck, I bought it and I’m hooked ever since. This is my second bottle! It doesn’t smell like much but this is the first foamy cleanser that does not dry me out. I have oily/combi skin so I mostly feel tightness around my cheeks and my T-zone needs more cleaning at times. This removes light makeup and I use this as my second cleanser routine after oil cleansing. I also use this every morning as well and it just makes the skin look pretty & radiant. The price is worth for a giant tube and I only squeeze out a Sing 10cent coin for a nice creamy cleanse. I think this is an awesome cleanser. So underrated! "
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Great Daily Cleanser,"I first tried this cleanser sometime last year though my monthly BoxyCharm subscription, and I’ve been hooked ever since. Not only is it a good cleanser, but a good makeup remover as well. My acne improved, and my face just looked more glowing in general. One bottle lasted me a couple months because a little goes a long way with this stuff, so the price is worth it."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,amazing cleanser!!,I love this cleanser to pieces it’s my go to morning cleanser. It makes my skin feel clean but also hydrated and smooth. It’s great.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Canada,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Name says it all. Gentle cleanser that's gets rid of impurities and makeup residues without drying the skin. Use it two times a day and absolutely love it on my sensitive skin!
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,"I got this free in a monthly subscription box. I generally use a different cleanser, but find myself constantly reaching for this one. I love the feeling it leaves my skin. It doesn’t feel tight after using. It’s just soft and fresh. A little goes a long way too which is great!"
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Wonderful gentle cleanser,"Most Glamglow cleansers are too strong for my sensitive skin but I love this one. It’s very gentle, doesn’t irritate my dry patches or make me break out and I love that it's unscented. I actually like to use this as a body wash as well because it’s so gentle and feels so nice on my skin."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,I loved the Glamglow bubble mask and thought this would be good to use daily. This lathered up really nice and seemed to be improving a few breakouts I had but then more started popping up everywhere. They went away when I stopped the product and came back when I started again which was a bummer. I switched to another cleanser.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,,Ms.,"It’s a very gentle cleanser a very good product, bought it right away after trying the sample. Just a small pump every wash and it does the wonders. Have been loving it so far, will definitely consider to repurchase it! "
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,I loved it. Its not drying at all and cleans well.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Canada,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,"Love this product. Harsh cleaners dry my skin out, this one i have had no ill effects and a little goes a long way. I only use a pea size amount with my Foreo Luna and get an unbelievable clean and skin feels soft and nourished afterwards."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Truly leaves a glow,"I received this as part of a monthly subscription box. I’m usually a bit nervous to try to new skin care. I have a simple routine that works for me. At 43 I have aging skin so I try my best to care for it properly.  I decided to give this a shot.  I am in love with this cleanser. In fact, I am here to purchase as my freebie is almost gone. It is a great formula. Lathers beautifully and it doesn’t leave a residue at all. It also doesn’t leave your skin feeling tight as if every natural oil has been stripped away. It really leaves my skin soft and fresh and definitely glowing.  I’m not just saying that either (lol, promise). 
You will not being disappointed in this cleanser."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Amazing!,"Love this! I got this in my BoxyCharm, and I loved it so much that I’ve constantly rebought this."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Amazing product!,"I'm fairly new to the skincare world and got this product for free in a BoxyCharm box. I didn't have much hope for it because the first cleanser I used (Dr. Brandt Clean Biotic pH-balanced yogurt cleanser) had dried my face out to the point where I was developing eczema on my cheeks, but, OH MY GOD! This cleanser does amazing things for my skin! Since I first started using this cleanser, my face has been clear, hydrated, and CLEAN without the stiff feeling! I've since tried two other cleansers and both times I've gone back to this one! Definitely a top product for my skin!"
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Holy Grail Face Wash,"I just finished my first full container of this (took about 4  months, SO happy with how long it lasted!! I use it twice a day). I wanted to wait long enough after using it so I could give a completely honest and accurate opinion. Using this face wash morning and night has changed my life!!! Seriously my face has never been so clear and felt so soft and smooth with each wash. I actually look forward to using this! I will be buying this forever"
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Canada,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,"It's creamy, gives a nice rich lather, skin feels soft and clean. I got breakouts from using another product and this helped so much, within a few days the breakouts were gone. I little goes along way."

GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Love it!!,I first got this bottle from my boxycharm I also purchased one of those honeycomb face sponge and those two combined omg life changer!

GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,"I’m on bottle #2. I use a pea sized amount to wash my face, behind my ears, and around my neck. I’m a nursing assistant and sweat a lot, and this keeps my pores from getting clogged with dirt while keeping my dry skin moisturized. Sometimes I use it with a silicone tool."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,"I wanted to love it, and I did at first. it made my skin feel clean but not overly dry. but after using it for about 2 weeks I have a bunch of tiny whiteheads all over my face."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Love this!,I got this in my Boxycharm and fell in love! I love that there is no scent and that its gentle and moisturizing. It cleared up my skin and left my face the clearest it's ever been. I have combination-dry skin depending on the season. Would highly recommend!
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Canada,love it,"Purchased this wash off the Sephora website, must say I really love how the product lathers up nicely, a little bit goes a long way. Leaves my skin smooth and refreshed. Definitely would repurchase again."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,I really enjoy using this product. I use it in the morning to gently wash my face. I have sensitive rosacea skin and it doesn’t bother me at all.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,just ok,This product was just ok for me. The bubbles feel clean but  that’s about it. I did break out at first but when I switched to using it every other day the breakouts slowly went away. I do have a few dryness around my cheeks. I will just finish this one out and never buy again.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Nah,"This product isn't the worst, it smoothes out my face and is really moisturizing. But I have normal skin, it's not oily and it's not dry. I started breaking out and that's when I realized I could sleep with a full face of makeup for 2 years without washing my face before bed and I'd still not get as much acne as I do now with this face wash. I also have acne scars when I didn't even bother my bumps or pimples, rest in peace my skin and I don't recommend this product :( really sad because it's in a pretty tube"
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,HOLY GRAIL.,"I adore this. It’s as gentle as Cerave, but gives you the satisfying texture of a foaming cleanser. It takes off makeup well and doesn’t contain fragrance.  Hands down my favorite. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Makes eyebrow hairs come off. BEWARE!!!,I really wanted to love this product. I really did especially since its vegan however please beware. It made some of my eyebrow hairs come off! MY EYEBROWS!!!!!!! Which i have been taking so long to grow back and now i have some patches missing. NOT OKAY.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Canada,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,I got this with a boxycharm box and fell in love ! A little goes along way and it's perfect for sensitive skin. I use this daily with an exfoliating cleanser weekly and its perfect
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,"I got this in one of my boxy charms. Although it is really gentle as people say, it wasn’t a bad thing in my opinion. I feel it really did take off all of my makeup effectively. I have gone through the whole tube and I highly recommend this product."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,"It works, but not for me.","It works, but it's just eh. don't get me wrong, I do like it! its completely scentless, is thick and lathers nicely. it gets the job done but it's pretty plain. I have sensitive skin but I'm prone to acne. this product was definitely good for sensitive skin but did nothing for my acne. they do have a different cleanser that I really love, but I dont think I'll ever buy this one again."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,"Packaging is nice, it does clean as a face wash should clean but it smells HORRIBLE! Almost like baby puke or formula! I’m not sure I can get past the smell and I only noticed the smell after washing and dying, see I try all face washes on my hands first to test them and so I used a dime sized amount on my hands it feels soft however I lathered up and rinsed then dried my hands them smelled my hands to see what smell if any it left behind and yup stinks! My hands stink still after rewarding them with my bath and body works like ugh! Two stars one for cute packaging and one for it cleans as soap should! It’s up to you to try it for yourself. Tg I got it in my boxycharm and didn’t spend 28$ of my own money or I’d return this ASAP."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Awesome cleanser,I received this item in a boxy charm box and I loved it. I have combination skin and it works very good. Leaves my face clean and soft.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,,Love,"Fall in love with this cleanser. My skin is dry, so it does the job, feeling smooth after cleaned up my face. Not like other usual foam cleanser, made my skin dry. This cleanser definitely my favourite now."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,Canada,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,"Bought a week ago and I never had acne before but now I have tons of acne. 
Absolutely not for someone who has sensitive skin like me."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Awesome Cleanser!,I got this in a BoxyCharm box and have since bought my 2nd bottle. This is amazing! I has made face super soft. Does well cleaning. It even made my eyebrows soft too.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,,mediocre,"Has a somewhat off-putting milky scent and the cleansing effect is nothing great. For this price point of RM100+, you can get better cleansers from other brands."
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Love,"I received this in my boxycharm and I love it! When they had it on sale, I bought 3 more tubes. My face doesn't feel dry and tight afterwards, the lather feels super soft, and a lil goes a looooooong way! 1 tube will last you!"
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,I’ve always had trouble finding a good cleanser for my sensitive skin without it being too stripping or not doing enough for my skin. I used the Cetaphil daily cleanser until I got this in my Boxycharm back in May and I have not gone back! Definitely will repurchase.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Glamglow Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,At first I loved that this product just washed off all my makeup without leaving any residue but with continued use I’ve noticed that it completely dried out my skin and made it flaky over time. I gave it three stars because while I do have sensitive skin that can be prone to breakouts with the use of new and unfamiliar products but thankfully this did not cause any acne.
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,Love!,"I received this in a beauty subscription box and it started my obsession with glamglow! It’s a great daily face wash that isn’t harsh on the skin, and didn’t have a smell if you are sensitive to that. 10/10 would recommend to anyone"
GLAMGLOW-Gentlebubble™ Daily Conditioning Cleanser,USA,"Like, absolutely not.","This product began showing results immediately. Unfortunately in this case, that's a terrible thing."
ELEMIS-Dynamic Resurfacing Facial Wash,Singapore,Not bad,This facial wash is relatively a good face wash. It is not drying on the face but yet if used daily it can get drying especially on dry skin. doesn't remove make up 
CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,Best Cleanser!,The cleanser is nice and foamy and did a good job cleansing my skin and leaving it feeling smooth and clean. It doesn't leave my face feeling dry at all. A little product goes a long way! I would recommend this to a friend.
CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Softening Cleansing Foam,A nice cleansing foam! Cleans without drying my skin
CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,Solid cleansing foam that actually foams,"I bought the mini and so far, so good. It took 3 tries to use the proper amount - you need SO little to get it to foam (like a small pea). I think anyone saying its hard to rinse off used too much or didn't mix it with water, it's intense if you use it straight. Docking a point because I don't love the smell (bit old fashioned), but its mild. It'll take me at least a month or two to use up the mini so price-wise its not bad, I will buy the bigger one if it doesn't dry me out."
CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Singapore,so good!,"Smell luxurious. Cleans well. Just feel great to have it at my skincare counter. Will definitely repurchase this cleanser. From now on, I will only use this cleanser Ss it makes me feel happy!"
CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Softening Cleansing Foam,The smell is amaizing. Makes my skin soft and healthy. This is by far my favorite cleanser.
CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,Worst cleanser EVER.,"I don’t get how anyone could like this. It feels like a bar of soap but in liquid form. It smells like soap. It foams up a lot, which is fair because it’s in the name but I find anything foaming tends to be drying. It was hard to rinse off and left that weird squeaky feeling on the skin that bar soap leaves. My skin felt gross after. I love luxury products and have pricier cleansers than this so I’m not trying to imply that pricey cleansers aren’t ever worth it, but THIS ONE seriously isn’t. Horrible, horrible product and I definitely wouldn’t recommend for anyone but especially not dry/dehydrated skin."
CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Softening Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This cleanser left my skin feeling clean and soft, but I felt it took a long time to rinse off. A little goes a long way and I love how it lathers up. The only issue was the scent, It was very strong and reminded me of that mature lady cosmetic smell. This cleanser just wasn’t for me."
CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Softening Cleansing Foam,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,Beautiful cleanser,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a beautiful and luxurious cleansing foam. A little goes a long way with this product. It leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized. It doesn’t leave any residue and does remove my makeup residue as I typically double cleanse. This is a predict product that is very similar to other Shi Seido cleansers that I have tried in the past. I would likely choose those cleansers over this one as I find that they work very similarly and the results are nothing significantly different for me using the Cle de Peau line.
CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,Great cleansing foam for dry skin,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The cleansing foam was effective at removing impurities, oil, and dirt. After using this cleansing foam on my face in the shower, my skin felt more clean, smooth, and hydrated.

I was skeptical of it being effective if it was supposedly gentle and non-drying, BUT it actually works amazingly! This cleanser is gentle and foams up beautiful. It doesn’t make your face feel tight or dry at all and it actually takes off all of the oil and grime from the day! I was even able to do other things after washing my face before running to use a toner (there was zero taut feeling that needed me to run for something to hydrate or moisturizer). I was able to take my time with my skincare regiment. I also enjoyed the light perfumed scent but that may be an issue for some people with sensitivities to smells."

Foams up well and leaves skin feeling super clean and yet soft afterwards. I really love it but it’s definitely on a higher price point for a cleanser but you get what you pay for.

It wasn’t too scented which I loved. I will forsure give this a second chance and purchase the full size bottle!
CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,A little goes a long way.,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It's gentle enough to use everyday. It does really foam up. My skin did feel soft after. I'm not sure if I would buy it as the price is a bit high.
CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Softening Cleansing Foam,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,It was ok,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Very similar to the Shiseido face wash as someone mentioned here. Cle de Peau is the luxurious line from the Shiseido umbrella so that why we see some similarities! The face wash cleansed well and wasn’t very drying either.
I tried the small sample sachet so will need to do more testing to really get a feel but so far I didn’t find it too special."
CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,Okay for the price,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Okay for the price. It lathers fine and the scent is okay.

CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,Exact dupe to shiseido foam cleanser,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product for free from @influester and from cle de peau in exchange for my honest review... In terms of the cleanser, the cleanser is very creamy and foams really easily. It has a light scent which is not too overpowering. It does cleanse really well and it will leave your skin feeling clean. I have combination skin so it felt a bit dry in areas where my skin is a normal/dry combo. Otherwise, it did leave a clean feeling. In terms of smell, for those that have used a shiseido foam cleanser it feels and smells exactly the same as a shiseido cleanser. I couldn't tell a difference between this cleanser and my shiseido cream cleanser. Considering that cle de Beau is made by shiseido, that would explain the same texture, scent and outcome but I was expecting that it would something a bit more luxurious. A little does go a long way since it's very creamy which means that if you purchase a full size product the cleanser will probably last you a while."

First of a little goes a long way. The cleanser was foamy and left my skin glowing. My partner asked me after one use what I was doing different because it left my skin soft and glowing.
The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because it’s price point doesn’t fit within my beauty budget. #influenster"
CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,Lil application and clear whole face,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) When i started opening my sample sashe i was hard to take it out properly. I took i my hand and applied to face and surprisingly i loved it.

CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Softening Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I only had two samples to try so definitely not long term use but I really liked my introduction to this product! A little definitely goes a long way, and I was so surprised with how much of a smooth lather was created from such a small amount. I have dry skin and this did not feel drying at all which was great. Left my skin feeling so cleansed and smooth, it was hard to believe it was after using only one product. I wasn’t a huge fan of the scent, however."
CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,Cle De Peau Softening Cleansing Foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love that this creates a nice thick soft lather even with just a little bit of product, and a little goes a long way! My skin felt squeaky clean after which I don't tend to like, but my skin didn't feel stripped and dry. The only downside was the scent which I initially felt was too strong but was less noticeable after a few uses. Personally I feel like this is an okay cleanser for my dry skin but for the price there are a lot of better and cheaper options."
CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,Gentle daily cleanser!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received two sample sachets of this product to try out, and from the few usages that I was able to get out of them it was a positive experience!

The cleanser foams up really nicely giving a soft type of foam with very fine bubbles and has quite a refreshing scent to it. It cleanses really well without being super harsh on the skin and doesn’t strip the skin of its oils. It is more of a gentle cleanser I would say, so it’s great for everyday use!"
CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,So clean!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is great for a double cleanse! I love how foamy it gets and takes off all the dirt and oil at the end of day  but not make up. I love how it leaves my skin so soft and smooth after a cleanse , no tightness or dryness so it’s perfect! The price isn’t too  crazy but definitely still a splurge item but I would buy it again:)"

CLE DE PEAU-Softening Cleansing Foam,Canada,Luxurious foam,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This cleanser comes out as a thin paste that becomes into a luxurious foam after.

JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,"A bit too drying, and unpleasant scent","Although I over all enjoyed using this cleanser to help fight acne, I found that it was very drying. It has a tendency to dry out your skin a bit too much. It also a bit of a medicinal smell to it that's a bit off putting. Otherwise, it is a great cleanser."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Gentle but deep cleaning!,"I had a really great experience using this cleanser for the past 2 weeks. It uses a combination of organic ingredients including lemon, cherry and aloe to provide a nice deep clean, but is still gentle enough to use on irritated skin. Due to the addition of these ingredients, it does have that natural green scent, but I enjoy it since it doesn’t smell like fake fragrance. It also does not leave my skin with that tight dry feeling afterwards, which is great because I know it’s not stripping the natural oils in my face either.

JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Powerful yet gentle cleanser for blemished skin,"This cleanser provides a really thorough cleanse to detoxify and clear your skin of all dirt, makeup, and impurities. I have dry and sensitive skin, and despite being a powerful cleanser targeting blemished skin, it didn't strip my face of moisture and was surprisingly hydrating! The texture is sort of gel-like which foams with a bit of lathering, and it is also unscented which I love! The ingredients list is also really interesting, which includes organic cherry, lemon, dandelion, sage leaf, algae, and aloe. Sunflower oil is also on the list, but this is a safe oil for your skin as it is non-clogging and is actually highly absorbent and non-comedogenic. I use this 2x a week in rotation with my gentle cream cleanser and it's definitely helped keep my skin clear of pimples!"

JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,A nice light cleanser!,"This cleanser is really nice and light. By that I mean that a lot of blemish clearing cleansers tend to be very drying and can make my skin feel tight but this cleanser does not do that. It takes away makeup and dirt, but is nondrying and feels good on the face. I like the way it smells, light and not overpowering and I really, really appreciate the fact that it is organic. The older I get the more I am looking for that. I received this product in exchange for my honest review."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,A little too exfoliating,"The top ingredients in this cleanser are an impressive blend of organic lemon, sweet cherry, grape and aloe juices.

Overall I really like the texture and I think the cleanser has great ingredients.

The Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser is by far the best blemish cleanser I’ve tried yet. I saw results within the first two days of using it! 

I have been using this twice daily for about a week now. The results are in and with confidence, I can tell you that I have finally found a cleanser for my acne prone skin and regular breakouts that works! Just by using this for such a short time my skin has cleared up amazingly and no new breakouts yet!

It makes my skin incredibly soft and smooth, and is the first cleanser I’ve used that doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight and dry. I love the gel texture and the smell of it. A little goes a long way and to me it smells clean with a hint of lemon is the only way I can describe it (it doesn't smell bad in my opinion at all). 

While using this cleanser, my skin has never looked better. It clears breakouts quickly but is gentle enough to use everyday. It’s great if you have combination skin!"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Mild on the skin,"The cleanser is Light weight in texture and watery, doesn't really lather so well when in contact with water but gives a good cleanse without any skin tightness feel (drying).

👉it is hydrating cleanser but not much for really dry skin people like me
👉this product is good for the people with oily to normal skin

👉this is great that it is a vegan product
👉 great for normal, combination and oily skin, felt like it is not hydrating for people with dry skin

JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Worked for me!,"Was looking for an acne cleanser that wasn't chemical heavy and drying, and this turned out to work for me. I love the gel texture and it left my skin feeling cleansed but not stripped. My only issue is that I've noticed it doesn't do a great job at cleansing my pores, especially because it's on the gentler side. I'd recommend this to anyone suffering with acne who needs a more hydrating and natural cleanser."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,"Every time I used this i was gagging from the smell. And i broke out so bad, maybe it was my skin purging? but i went back to my old cleanser after a week and haven’t had any pimples since."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,so far so good!,"im starting to notice a difference after about 3 weeks of continuous use and im very impressed! i love the formula and it feels really nice to wash my face with this. my acne seems to be calming down and im experiencing less breakouts! lost a star for the size, its a pretty small bottle but i should’ve probably expected that. the scent is a bit off putting but i dont really care because this cleanser does what it says."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Cleared my acne and breakouts!,I have been using this twice daily for over a week now. I have searched years for a cleanser for my acne prone skin and regular breakouts. just by using this for such a short little time my skin has cleared up amazingly and no new breakouts! Love love love this cleanser. Highly recommend!!! Definitely worth a try
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,"This is honestly the best face wash/cleanser I’ve ever used. My skin has completely cleared up since I started using this, it makes my skin incredibly soft and smooth, and is the first face wash I’ve used that doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight and dry. Well worth the money!"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,"This product is amazing, even after the first use I noticed an amazing difference. I wash my face twice a day and each more I wake up I can see that the redness and blotchiness is gone."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Really wanted to love this as I really like some of their other products however this broke me out more. I really tried to give it a fair shot. Would not recommend if you really struggle with acne.
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Enjoy it a lot! Not harsh and smells fresh.,"Honestly, love it. I've been looking for a cleanser I love for years, and this is it. Doesn't dry my skin out. A little goes a long way, it smells herbaceous and fruity (it doesn't smell bad in my opinion). No fragrances that make my eyes water, and I do really like the consistency."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Amazing!!!,"One of my favourite cleansers I have ever used. I was struggling with constant breakouts, no matter what I tried, nothing helped. I was then told to try this cleanser out and within 3 days my skin had cleared up almost completely. The price is not bad either which makes it even better. Will purchase again!!"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Not what I Expected,"This made me breakout more and my skin was so oily after use.
And it didn’t help that it didn’t smell very good either."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,"Amazing!! Cleared up my stubborn postpartum acne in 3 days. So gentle, does not strip my skin at all. And I’m obsessed with the smell. Another win for juice beauty!"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,I really liked this cleanser it worked well and didn’t dry my skin out!
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,just got this but i am pretty confident that it is good! smells a bit like apple cider but that is becuase thats one of the ingredients. If you are thinking about getting it then u should :)
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,My New Favourite Cleanser,I love this cleanser! It definitely helps with my acne and blemishes. It leaves my skin clean and smooth. Will buy this again.
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Waste of money,Definitely nothing special! this cleanser not only smells bad it also hasn’t done anything for me and I actually think it made me break out even more.
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,clear skin,By far the best blemish cleanser. I saw results within the first two days of using it!
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Nothing Special,This cleanser didn't help my acne but it also didn't make my skin worse. Skin feels good after using but this cleanser isn't anything special. Can probably find something either the same or better for cheaper.
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Completely Cleared My Acne!,"I've been really struggling with breakouts the last few months, tried a few things and nothing worked, then I got this product and my acne was cleared up within 2 weeks. fingers crossed it keeps working so well because this is LOVELY!"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,"This cleanser is amazing! It helped me to keep my skin clear, and it's also clean :)"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,did not love it,I had high Hope's fir this because I absolutely love juice beauty but this product was a miss for me I didnt like the fermented fruit stench it came with and it made it hard to use honestly. i also didn't notice my break outs going down when using either. just sits in my shower :/ on bright side I dont think it broke me out more or anything.
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Fantastic Product. Have been using it for 3 years.,"I was recommended this product because the previous cleanser I was using dried out my face and I have been using this cleanser twice a day every day since that time 3 years ago. It is the best cleanser I have ever used! It is great for blemish clearing without drying out your skin. It does not have any heavy fragrances. While using this cleanser, my skin has never looked better and I used to struggle with acne. A nice bonus as well is that there is alot of product for C$32. A bottle will often last me 4-6 months so I don't feel guilty spending some money on this cleanser. Do not hesitate to buy this product if you are considering purchasing it. It is truly fantastic!"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,"I love this new cleanser as a part of my skin care routine. It’s not too much for my sensitive skin, and it doesn’t over dry it like others do. It’s helped clear up my blemishes as well."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Does what it says!,"I ordered this cleanser not for blemish clearing purposes but for having an everyday cleanser which sloughs of dead skin cells. Washing my face with regular cleansers was not doing the job. I wanted something that was not too  strong and works for me between days when I am not using Retinol. Just a heads up, it will sting to any open wound especially the ones left after popping the zit."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,I’ve been using this cleanser for almost a year now and it doesn’t disappoint! It clears breakouts but is gentle enough to use everyday and great if you have combination dry or dry skin!
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Great for oily acne-prone skin,"Currently on my 4th bottle of this, my favourite cleanser doesn’t strip your skin and still leaves it feeling fresh and clean. Staple in my routine."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Life changing for my cystic acne!,"This has been life changing for my adult hormonal-acne prone skin. I use this product in conjunction with the Herbivore Bamboo Charcoal Detoxifying Soap Bar. I use one in the morning and the other at night, and my face has never been better. I used to get massive cystic acne each month and now I rarely do!!"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,holy grail!,Incredible for acne prone skin! Great ingredients! Love that they’re cruelty free and vegan! Highly recommend.
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,This is an alright cleanser. Ive got super picky skin and most things make me break out. This doesn't cause any additional break outs. It's good for the price and that it's pretty natural.
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,LOVE IT,"I have very dry skin, and have not found a blemish clearing cleanser that didn’t dry me. Usually when I use a acne wash, my skin is tight and my nose is super shiny from being stripped but you don’t get that with this one.
Once I started using it my acne started to clearing up and the scent is just amazing."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Great for Acne,I get minor acne breakouts in specific areas on my skin every once in a while and this helped clear up my acne. I'm in my 40's and it's difficult to find products that work.  I like that this is a clean product.
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,No for me,"I have adult acne, so I bought this as it was highly recommended by a sephora employee and I read a lot of good reviews online as well. I used the whole bottle and didn't see any changes in my skin- super disappointed :("
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,LOVE,"Holy grail product. I try to only use it once a day since it does dry out your face a little, but when I don't use this product I automatically get acne in a week or two. I use a more gentle cleanser in the AM or no cleanser at all. I also like to use this product in the shower for my bacne. 
(I have oily acne prone skin that is sensitive)"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Does the Job It's Meant For,"I've been using this product for almost a year now, and its simply become a staple to my skincare routine. Other products from this line has been great for my skin !"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,This is amazing. my skin is finally clearing out. I have a really sensitive and when I use products that clog my pores. it deals with those tiny rashes in days
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Didn't work for me,"I was really excited to try this product after doing a lot of research. I recently, out of no where, got some cystic acne near forehead/hair line. So I bought this. I've used it every night for a month and there has been no improvement. I am also used to cleansers leaving my skin red for a little but my skin would stay red for many minutes after each use. I have a healthy diet (maybe my acne is due to stress). Will not be purchasing again."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Love this product :),Did they change the packaging? The product I usually use is a clear bottle. However if this is the same stuff. I been using this for about 2 years and I love it. It's very moisturizing. Doesn't strip my skin at all.
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Maintenance,"For me, (oily skin) it worked to maintain the current state. I didn't get more outbreaks but I didn't improve either. The product also smells like some fruit mix that I can't put my finger on."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,love !!,"I have had moderately bad, consistent acne since I was 13 and this cleanser is one of, if not, the best I have ever used! I have combination skin and this cleanser is not too drying and I started to notice an improvement in my acne with one week. Also, it's organic!"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,BEST THING!!!!,"This is the best cleanser I have ever used, I had cystic acne and this product made my skin as clear as it can get. I use it together with the juice beauty serum and it changed my skin"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,i rarely breakout when i use this,great cleanser. i use with my clarisonic and my skin feels deeply cleansed but not stripped. i started using this cleanser with their blemish clearing serum and my skin cleared up almost immediately. one of the best salicylic acid face cleansers.
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Not my miracle product,"Didn’t aggravate my acne, but didn’t clear it up either, even when used in conjunction with the Blemish Clearing Serum (couldn’t use the moisturizer, as I had a reaction to it). I used it for well over a month. It seemed like it might have calmed my acne down a bit (especially the little whiteheads on my forehead) but didn’t make it go away by any stretch. 

Smells like a cross between licorice"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,"Love this product , smells a bit different and has a strong smell , but works so good , prevents acne and improves acne as well!"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Cleans your skin very well while still leaving it hydrated. I would definitely buy it again!
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,one of the best cleansers I've used. the price is great too because you need so little. they suggested morning and night but I find it dries up my skin if I use it twice a day so I only use it in the morning. really cleaned up my pores and I like the smell too
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,super effective and does its job well,My sister had bought the cleanser and never used it so she gave it to me and I was so thankful she did! It’s really the only cleanser that I’ve used that’s been effective in clearing up my skin. I bought my second bottle after using the first one for a couple of months. Would highly recommend if you have acne and random breakouts— it clears them up in about 2 days!!
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,the best face wash for acne prone skin,"This face wash is amazing. Ive had adult acne for the past two years, and this is he only face wash that I’ve seen a difference with. I’ve tried TTYP cleanser, DE cleanser, avene, etc. But this one I’ve noticed clearup and it doesn’t break me out from using it. It doesn’t sting my eyes nor is it stripping. My skin loves this stuff. A beauty advisor recommended it to me, and I feel my face has finally started clearing up a bit from using this. This face wash does have a very strong smell, but it doesn’t bother me, as the benefits outweigh this one negative. 100% recommend to all my acne prone people out there!"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,love it!! smells odd tho...,"I love this cleanser!!!! My skin was going through a really weird patch and I was getting little bumps all over my chin, and this is really helping it, along with the blemish clearing serum!!! Love those two together! And the best part about this...ITS ORGANIC & CLEAN!!! Would definitely recommend. The smell is a little odd though...kind of like a mix of brown sugar and apple cider vinegar, but I’ve just gotten used to it."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Very good for acne,"I found that this product is very useful for people with acne prone.However, I do not recommend it for people with sensitive skin. I have sensitive skin and it made my skin red."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,This stuff really does treat blemishes. I stopped using it and started breaking out again so re purchased it.
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Great as a daily wash,I really like this stuff as it feels like it helps my skin remain clearer. I would not say it is a Miracle in a bottle but it’s reasonably priced and smells good.
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,It doesn't help in reducing Blemishes or Acne.,"I got the Trio set which consisted of a cleanser, serum, and a moisturizer. I read mixed reviews on this product but I wanted to try it anyway. It definitely did help me in controlling my oily skin but it hasn't worked for my blemishes or acne. If you have oily skin, it might work for you but I'm not sure of reducing blemishes and acne."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,"Great product, okay smell","Definitely keeps my blemishes and acne at bay. I wouldn't say it completely got rid of anything, but it did help with my oily skin. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is the smell is quite over whelming. I am not sure if I will repeat purchase due to that."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,The best! just beware of the smell,I was looking for a more natural product to cleanse my skin with as ive been having bad hormonal acne and this stuff is great. The smell is absolutley putrid and almost makes you gag lol but it works well and has cleared up my problem areas well. also makes your skin very soft. I go between this and the youth to the people one. so far so good woukd recommend if you can handle its weird smell.
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,meilleure nettoyant pour visage que j'ai essayer diminuer les pores de peau en 1 lavage je le recommande a toutes
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,"I got this in a subscription box ages ago and I tried it reluctantly as I already had a skincare routine that worked for me (or so I thought). This cleanser is now an absolute must. It is gentle, great for sensitive skin, removes makeup better than any cleanser I've used, and keeps my blemish prone skin clear."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,"I've been using Korean cleansers up till now because they're pretty powerful and kept my face super clean however this always came with side effects; rough skin and white patches despite moisturizing. I personally don't like shiny skin so I'd use a light moisturizer which doesn't help. And a strong moisturizer would be too much shine and oil after a couple of hours. So it was a constant struggle choosing between rough or a sweaty looking face. I dropped by Sephora and a kind lady was more than happy to compare different cleaners for me. At first, I didn't like it very much because it doesn't lather so well, and the smell isn't too great either however it not only cleanses but moisturizes really well at the same time. It gives me that clean feeling Korean cleansers did, while retaining moisture to the point where it doesn't accumulate to make my skin shiny."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Holy grail!,"I used to have tiny bumps all over my face and no cleanser would change that until I was told about this miracle worker! My skin is softer, brighter, and acne free. Highly recommend"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,Canada,Recommend,"Pros:
- I really like the natural ingredients in this product
- Doesn't irritate or exacerbate my extremely sensitive, break out prone skin
- Leaves my skin feeling clean and nourished, not stripped and dry 

Cons:
- While this leaves my skin feeling clean, I still suffer from occassional hormonal chin acne 
- As other reviews have mentioned, this product  has a somewhat offputting smell to it (though natural, not as in added fragrance; doesn't bother me to the point I would discontinue using it solely because of this)

Overall, I haven't decided if I'll repurchase. While I love that the ingredients are actually good for your skin and while this product helps to at least minimize the severity of acne flare-ups, it hasn't transformed my skin in the way I was (maybe unrealistically) hoping. That said, definitely worth a try; has a lot going for it in that the pros outweigh the cons."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,USA,Best Cleanser and life saver for acne prone skin!,"This is the best cleanser I've ever tried! I am totally in love with this product. This works great by itself, but I use with the blemish clearing serum every day. This cleanser has been a lifesaver many times for me when I sometimes try another product just to experiment. I will always come back to this one!"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,USA,Great for Dry and Acne-Prone Skin,"This is the ONLY acne-targeted product that will not dry out your skin. I have an odd combination of acne and dry/dehydrated skin, so most acne-reducing products out there just make my face feel like sandpaper. This one leaves my face feeling great! It doesn’t feel tight or very dry after washing. It hasn’t done wonders for my face in terms of acne, but not even behind the counter dermatologist prescribed products work on my skin, so I’m pretty happy! I used the matching serum as well which I believe has been causing new whiteheads to form every morning on my skin, so I stopped using it. The cleanser works like a charm though!"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,USA,Works like a charm!,"This cleanser is AMAZING! I have combination to oily skin and it has helped hydrate my skin without making it feel dry! I used to get a lot of that dry/oily feeling with other cleansers, but this Juice Beauty one changed everything. Definitely recommend it!"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,USA,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,I’ve found this to be my favourite summer cleanser. My skin loves this and it really helps with redness or bumps.
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,USA,Amazing,I had really bad acne. I was trying to find a really good cleanser and this worked extremely well. I have been using this for 4 months now and my acne has gone down. My skin is smooth with little to no bumps. This also doesn’t dry out my skin to much!
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,USA,BEST CLEANSER I’VE HAD SO FAR!!,I’m really picky when it comes to skincare and i’ve tried soooo many brands when it comes to cleanser. But this one is by far the best! Doesn’t strip your face and it smells natural. And i’ve noticed that my skin has tremendously looked better than before. Will definitely purchase this again ☺️
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,USA,Dryed me out,"Started using this a few days ago with such high hopes, at first this cleanser felt so refreshing for my skin until a few days later, when my skin started feeling so dry, and was so so red that it looked like I had a severe sunburn. Feel like this is better for people with oily skin"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,USA,Game-changer,"I decided to try this product after reading quite a few reviews myself...I struggle with sensitive combintion skin as well as occasional cystic acne and have been a product guinea pig/junkie ever since I was a preteen. I must say though: this cleanser is one of the best I've ever used. I noticed a difference even after the first use: skin felt better, brighter, properly cleared and breatheable. If you have any of the same concerns with me I would urge you to give this cleanser a try - I'm so happy that I did :)"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,USA,CLEARS CONGESTION,"This cleanser has really helped me whenever I have congested areas on my skin. After I rinse it off my skin feels smooth, as if I just exfoliated it!! I don’t feel dry from this cleanser either which makes me love it even more."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,USA,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,"Smells a little strange but I quite like it, almost tingles while using it. Doesn’t dry out my skin at all! I have crazy dry flaky skin and doesn’t over dry my cheeks at all. I believe my skin is clearing too but possibly too early to truly tell."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,USA,my new holy grail cleanser,"I've never felt in love with a cleanser until I tried this one. You feel super clean but never dried out and it helped clear up soo much congestion on my skin! Literally, all those tiny bumps I used to have on my forehead are practically gone. I've had those since I was a pre-teen and I've only now found something to get rid of them. It also tones your skin so now I can skip toner! Ughh just the best ❤️❤️❤️"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,USA,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,"i liked how light this was, but the smell threw me off, its a bit like boiled veg (if that makes sense, sorry, i can't really tell)"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,USA,Ewwww,"This product smells bad, feels gross and doesn’t work on my acne. For the price tag I was very disappointed."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,USA,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,"I have adult, acne prone skin. This product helped clear my skin within a week. Unlike other acne treatments, this didn’t completely strip my skin! Will definitely repurchase."
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,USA,Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser,"I have combination oily skin that is very prone to break outs. I have tried just about everything, including a 400 dollar doctors prescribed cream to clear my break outs... this cleanser works better than that! I’ve been using this for a month or so now and have had no new break outs and stopped using the pricey acne medication. I’m in love!"
JUICE BEAUTY-Blemish Clearing Cleanser,USA,Great for sensitive skin,"Cleared quite a bit of my acne which is cystic/white head sebum; leaves skin hydrated, never dries it out.  Super gentle, doesn't make my skin red. Would purchase again."
INDIE LEE-Soothing Cleanser,Australia,Love this cleanser,I love this cleanser - doesn't dry out my skin and leaves it feeling really soft. Doesn't have a strong scent either. 
INDIE LEE-Soothing Cleanser,Singapore,ms,I have different cleanser all the time this for used after some treatment that have downtime naturally it soothing my face first  time try on this brand 
INDIE LEE-Soothing Cleanser,Australia,Nope,Had to return this after 2 days because i couldn't stand the smell! I'm not sensitive to scent at all however this cleanser smells like white wine and it's really strong. Maybe some people would like that though lol. Was not a fan
INDIE LEE-Soothing Cleanser,New Zealand,Lovely!,I use this cleaner as a second step in my double cleansing routine. It leaves my skin feeling clean without feeling stripped of moisture. In my opinion it does have a strong scent but from natural ingredients. I really like the scent but others may not.
INDIE LEE-Soothing Cleanser,Singapore,INDIE LEE SOOTHING CLEANSER,it has a pungent smell to it.  I have to hold my breath to use it.   the after effect on skin after cleansing is still supple skin but not encourage to use it daily due to unpleasant scent.  Will not repurchase. 
DRGL-Cleanser Lightening Plus,Singapore,so far so good,"Bought this to try during the Sephora sale. It's very, verr pricey but a tiny bit goes a long way. It's not drying and feels comfortable. I use it with my foreo II and wait a while before rinsing. My pigmentation does seem lighter but please note that I also go for facials and use serums that may have played a part. Will likely repurchase during sales."
ORIGINS-Clear Improvement™ Zero Oil Active Charcoal Detoxifying Cleanser to Clear Pores,Canada,Impressed!,"I love this product so much, have been using it twice a day for the past month and has helped so much with my skin, will certainly be buying it again!"
ORIGINS-Clear Improvement™ Zero Oil Active Charcoal Detoxifying Cleanser to Clear Pores,Singapore,Not suitable for Combi Skin,doesn’t lather well! Feels oily and difficult to wash off! Not recommended. Try the ginseng scrub it’s the best so far! Doesn’t feel like there’s any detoxifying  
ORIGINS-Clear Improvement™ Zero Oil Active Charcoal Detoxifying Cleanser to Clear Pores,Malaysia,No visible effect,"Used it in the evening, still having oily skin in the next morning. no visible effect after finishing one tube, not considered to repurchase."
ORIGINS-Clear Improvement™ Zero Oil Active Charcoal Detoxifying Cleanser to Clear Pores,Canada,It's not the same as the old Mint and Saw Palmetto,"This product is definitely a let down. I've used Origins exclusively for nearly a decade now and the Zero Oil cleanser was the backbone of my skin care routine. I bought this thinking it was the same as the previous formulation since the packaging is the same but buyer beware. It's a new formula. And honestly I don't think it works as well as the mint saw palmetto one. It certainly smells worse, my skin doesn't feel as clean and I'm finding it's doing a worse job at keeping my skin happy. So I'm going to be looking elsewhere for my cleanser moving forward. 2 stars because it does meet the requirement of being a cleanser, just not a good one"
ORIGINS-Clear Improvement™ Zero Oil Active Charcoal Detoxifying Cleanser to Clear Pores,USA,Not awful but not special,"Of all the Origins skincare products I own, this is my least favorite, especially cleansers. Nothing special but a decent product for a simple and fast wash in the morning. Will not purchase again."
ORIGINS-Clear Improvement™ Zero Oil Active Charcoal Detoxifying Cleanser to Clear Pores,USA,drying,wouldn’t recommend if you have dry skin. left my skin even more dry and flaky after using. has a nice scent but not worth it.
ORIGINS-Clear Improvement™ Zero Oil Active Charcoal Detoxifying Cleanser to Clear Pores,Canada,good night cleanser !!,"i wouldn’t recommend as a morning and night cleanser, i only use this at night. i use origins frothy face wash during the day because it’s lighter. this helps clear my pores and makes them perfect for the next day without stripping the skin. it’s a little more harsh than the usual cleanser which is why i don’t use this morning and night, but it’s such an amazing product! definitely works on clearing pores and smoothing out skin, it doesn’t dry the skin either which i love"
ORIGINS-Clear Improvement™ Zero Oil Active Charcoal Detoxifying Cleanser to Clear Pores,USA,Origins Clear Improvement™ Zero Oil Active Charcoal Detoxifying Cleanser to Clear Pores,This product helped me to finally get back to a good place with my skin after wearing masks all year destroyed it.
ORIGINS-Clear Improvement™ Zero Oil Active Charcoal Detoxifying Cleanser to Clear Pores,USA,Origins Clear Improvement™ Zero Oil Active Charcoal Detoxifying Cleanser to Clear Pores,I can only use this cleanser once or twice a week because it will dry me out.
ORIGINS-Clear Improvement™ Zero Oil Active Charcoal Detoxifying Cleanser to Clear Pores,Canada,worth it 100%,It has helped my skin so much. I use this with the charcoal mask and it’s helped my acne so much and has my skin feel so much softer and less bumpy
ORIGINS-Clear Improvement™ Zero Oil Active Charcoal Detoxifying Cleanser to Clear Pores,Canada,Origins Clear Improvement™ Zero Oil Active Charcoal Detoxifying Cleanser to Clear Pores,This face wash is pretty basic. It has quite a strong menthol smell. My issue was that it really irritates my eyes. I didn’t use it around my eye area but the face wash runs down my face when I rinse the cleanser off. It made my eyes really itchy. I think this might be a good face wash for men because of the charcoal-menthol components but I wouldn’t recommend it.
ORIGINS-Clear Improvement™ Zero Oil Active Charcoal Detoxifying Cleanser to Clear Pores,Canada,A MUST HAVE,"THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BACK!! 
I started using this cleanser about 10 years ago and eventually my husband did too. we both fell in love with its smooth gel like texture that easily builds a lather. We feel this combats our daily environmental stress without stripping all oils. This helps keeps my acne at bay. I use it as a spot treatment mask for pustules. Oh, and it doesn't sting my eyes which is a plus! The smell is a subtle mint eucalyptus scent, which is nice!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,"gentle cleanser, use 2x to really get clean feeling if you wore makeup. otherwise not irritating or drying, feels very nice after washing."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,New Zealand,YES,love this product. it goes on milky and can then be lathered with warm water (this has to be noted as O see many don't enjoy the product if not used correctly). the smell is a nice light lime which I really like and the product last a long time. works well to remove makeup 
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,breakout!!!,It made my skin breakout right after I used it. I stopped using the product and the breakout stopped with it.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,The best natural face wash hands down!,The only face wash that does not break me out! The ingredients are super clean and you can smell the hint of lime as well which is pleasant! You can make it as thin or thick as you want by adding more water to your face. Can be a makeup remover face wash combo!

For some reason it took me a hot minute to get that down, so let me speak plainly. If you do not massage and emulsify the product with water, it WILL NOT break down your makeup and sunscreen. Before doing those steps I was so confused as to why people liked it, now I love my little Key Lime Pie Cleanser."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,I’ve had better cream cleansers. I like Edible beauty but this and Coco bliss are too fragrant and not feeling luxurious but more like cheap products.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Glass bottle,Who makes a bathroom product made of glass! First time use and I dropped it... because it's made of glass! So disappointed.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,"I love cream, oil, and balm cleansers, and I had this one on my loves list for so long before I purchased. I was sorely disappointed. 

The cream is far too heavy to be an enjoyable cream cleanser. The thickness isn't the issue as much as the texture - somewhere between a cream and a balm, but really unpleasant feeling on the skin. Like washing with a really occlusive moisturizer. 

The 'hint of lime' is more like 'Lime Time! Extremely Lime Cleanser!' It smells more limey than a lime, and faker. It smells like kitchen cleaner. 

I tried using the cleanser as part of my usual routine, with and without a washcloth, and in the shower. I just couldn't find a way to make this an enjoyable experience. But the bottle is beautiful, so I decided to keep it. 

This is why I decided to write this review. The product would not come out of the bottle when I took out the pump. Adding water and shaking did nothing. Adding soap did nothing. I had to slowly break up the product using the pump and then an eyebrow brush to get it out of the bottle. I even let it soak for awhile with the soapy water (I used a foaming cleanser, thinking of the double cleansing method.) It's just too occlusive. 

Even if this were a moisturizer, I think it'd make your skin feel too hot, in addition to smelling like a clean floor. As a cleanser, it's just bad. 

The bottle is super beautiful, though, and you do get A TON of product for the price."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,"This is a great gentle cleanser! It’s nice and creamy and doesn’t irritate or dry my skin out. I use it after the brand’s oil cleanser at night and by itself in the morning. Since using it I’ve noticed that my skin is a lot less oily throughout the day, but is still very soft. I really enjoy the lime scent, but I can see how someone who is super sensitive to scents might not. Overall this is a great cleanser!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Gentle cleanser,"I’m so in love with this gentle cleanser. It’s nothing fancy crazy but does exactly what I need for a cleanser. I don’t like foamy cleanser which harshly washes out all of the moisture on my face. This one not only cleanses but leaves my face soft and moisturized after. It has all the nutrition that my face needs and preps it for the next steps. This one just feels right for me. If the price was a little bit lower, it would be the greatest cleanser. It’s still great enough overall."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,New Fave!,If you have been searching for a fave cleanser that removes all your makeup and won’t dry you out-THIS IS IT! I use this daily and my skin has never felt cleaner and happier. Love love love!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Perfect,"I always thought my skin needed tougher cleansers than this.  I was wrong, I use this everyday and my skin thanks me for it.  Plus it smells lovely."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,"this cleansing milk has truly repaired my skin! it is amazing and the formula is just so soothening. i have sensitive skin and this really helped! i recommend this product to people who want amazing, and new feeling skin:) amazing!!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,Australia,amazing!!!,"I’ve been looking so long for the perfect cleansing milk for combination skin, after a years of looking I can safely say I won’t be using any other product other than this again"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,Love how gentle this cleanser is! My skin felt very clean and nourished after using it. Did not irritate my acne or redness. Love this cleanser!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Gentle and so effective,"This is the perfect cleansing product for me! It is gentle and nourishing, leaving my skin feeling deeply cleaned without drying it out. It’s amazing how effective it is at dissolving oil and removing makeup gently! Sensitive skin rejoice!!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,,Milky smooth!,Love this product! The scent is amazing and it’s moisturising and smooth when apply on dry face before cleansing. Always use this in the morning. One pump is enough for the entire face and I usually leave on for a few minutes before rinsing it off. The glass bottle is big and I’m sure it will last me for more than 2-3 months. 
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,"So disappointed. my face was clear until I added this product to the mix. now I have acne on the sides of my face, hairline and jawline. product had nice consistency. not sure how I feel about the lime. can't recommend based on the acne."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Best cleanser I've ever used.,"Wow. After reading great things about this cleanser I thought I'd give it a try. I never expected a cleanser to have such a dramatic effect on my skin! This product is so heavenly to use. It feels like silk and the scent is amazing. It leaves skin deeply moisturized, bright, even and gorgeous. I can't believe how well this works. It delivers the kind of result you would expect from an expensive serum. I'm so happy with my skin, I can't go back - I'll never use another cleanser."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,I received a sample of this and it was my first time trying a cleansing milk. I liked it more than I thought. It doesnt foam like normal cleansers but it left my skin soft and very clean. Most cleansers leave my skin dry after but this did not. I liked it so much I'll probably switch to a cleansing milk!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Love Love Love,My new fav cleanser! I love how I can add to dry skin and really rub it into my skin. When I add the water and rub in some more.....my skin feels so clean and soft. I find this is enough to remove light makeup. If I had mascara on and heavy makeup I use the EB makeup remover oil.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,,a great gentle cleanser,i used this while taking roaccutane and it definitely didn't dry out my already dry skin. i finish my course before i finished the bottle but post roaccutane i felt that my skin got abit dull and swapped to an indie lee cleanser with better results.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,LOVEE,I love this stuff! I have combo skin that can be quite sensitive to products that can be too harsh and unresponsive to ones that are too gentle. This cleansing milk is the perfect middle! It helps my breakouts and keep my skin balanced pretty nicely. Not to mention how soft it makes my skin!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Took me a while to get use to!,Took me a while to get use to a milk cleanser as it does not foam. But it is so gentle on my skin. My skin feels so soft and clean. I now only use this cleanser.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Must have,Gentle yet effective for breakouts! Took a chance on this one and it did not disappoint. One of my staple cleansers.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,exceeded expectations,"I have never had luck with cleansing milk-type cleansers until this one, they usually leave my skin feeling not fully clean and I break out worse. The good reviews on this product from ladies who I thought had similar skincare concerns as me encouraged me to purchase and I’m glad I did. I’ve been using this cleanser for two months and my hormonal acne on my chin that I’ve struggled with since adolescence is gone. My skin feels so good and hydrated, and my pores on my cheeks are visibly smaller. I apply 2-3 pumps and work it into my skin with no water for 30 seconds and then I add water to my hands and cleanse for another 30 seconds. I do not use the other edible beauty products in my regimen after cleansing, but I do use a toner, serum and moisturizer after."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,,Beautiful creamy cleanser,I’m in love with this brand. This cleanser is the perfect first step in their core 4 range. This cleanser is light and creamy yet doesn’t leave any greasy residue. This is super easy to use and fantastic for anyone who has sensitive or reactive skin
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Gentle and soothing,This is the second edible beauty product I've tried and I'm becoming a huge fan of their line. This smells amazing and leaves my skin feeling so soft. Skin feels soft and clean with no dryness!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,beyond satisfying,"This whole edible beauty 1-4 line of daily products offers the best skincare I’ve ever used. I have acne prone and combination skin. It’s never looked or felt better. As soon as I started using these products I felt my skin craving them by end of day. I didn’t know it was possible my skin could feel so nourished. I even ordered a few of their other products Sephora doesn’t carry yet directly from their website and love them as well. Obsessed. I also use a sulfur acne mask 2-3x per week, which works best for me when I cleanse with this milk before and after as well."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Will It work for Teen and Mature Skin?,"I have normal teen combination skin and my mom has normal mature skin and we were both curious how this product would work for very different skin types. Both my mom and I really enjoyed using this product. It was not too rich for my teen skin nor was it too drying for her mature skin. I have been using this product for 2 months and it is one of my favorite cleansers that I have used that cleans the skin without stripping away essential moisture. Our skin did not feel tight or dry, so I say give this product a try. Full Discloser; I did receive this product in PR to test out on Teen Skin and to do a Skin Care Review for my Youtube Channel; Adventures With Carissa and I have recommended this product to Family and Friends, because they noticed an improvement in my skin being more balanced, healthy, and natural glow which is attributed to the use of this product along with the Tumeric Beauty Latte/Serum and the Sooth Me Balm."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,,May purchase again ,"Like the smell and the texture. Big nice bottle. But need to use a significant amount in order to clean properly (even for non-oily skin). May purchase again, depending on how it goes after using up."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,breakouts & blackheads,"I was really excited about this product based on the reviews. I have been trying use as many natural products in my routine as possible so I thought this cleanser would be a great option. I have been using for about a month now because I wanted to give this product a chance before giving up, I typically get hormonal acne on my jawline, cheeks, and chin around the time of my period but other than that I have no skin issues and let me tell you guys I have blackheads EVERYWHERE. Blackheads were never a problem for me whatsoever and currently my entire nose is covered as well as the sides of my face. I rarely wear makeup (I’ve worn it twice in the last month) and I am very strict about my skincare routine so I know that this product has caused them, I’m pretty bummed because all the reviews are good but it just didn’t work for me. Also this product doesn’t leave my face feeling clean, when I rinse it feels like the product leaves a film over my face. I’m assuming that’s because of the coconut oil in the product but can’t say for certain. Anyway, if you have sensitive acne prone skin this is NOT the product for you."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,A Joke,"I wanted to believe with all my heart that this product would work for me, but it didn't.  Nothing new happened to my skin.  Everything stayed the same.  This product is nothing but a waste of your money and a complete joke."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,new favorite!,"This is a fantastic cleanser! It’s so gentle yet I feel like it does an excellent job at cleaning my skin. I use it in the morning and to take makeup off at night. It’s a little more expensive than I’m used to, but it’s worth it once you look at and feel the quality of the ingredients."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Love this!!,I have sensitive skin and this product has been so soothing and calming. It's also really conditioning! Definitely would recommend!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Nourished skin!,I have been using the cleansing milk for 2 months now and my skin feels so nourished! I definitely recommend this product if you have dry skin
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,One of the best cleansers out there!,"I am in love with this cleanser! I needed a cleanser that was non-drying as to not further potentiate my acneic prone skin. This cleanser is soothing and has a wonderful scent to it that is very refreshing. It's best applied to DRY skin and rubbed in thoroughly, THEN add water in small amounts and continue to rub in circular motions to clean the skin."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Soft skin!,"I really like this product, my skin feels soft and smells amazing afterwards. You do need to clean your face a few times to get the makeup off, otherwise great!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,"I love love love this cleanser, it's very gentle yet extremely effective. I have oily skin and I have found by using this cleanser morning and night it has keep a lot of the extra oil I would normally see over the course of the day at bay."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Definitely recommend!!!!,"This is my new favorite cleanser! I have SO many and didn’t need another, but I absolutely love how my skin feels after using! Skin is so soft and hydrated!!! Normally, I would do a second cleanse after b/c I don’t feel that super clean feeling, but I have used many different toners after (including the #2 citrus from this line) and skin is definitely clean! It’s luxurious and can tell a difference after using for a week. I’m having a hard time reaching for my other cleansers now. This and the serum are my two favorites from this line and highly recommend!! I have combo, sensitive skin for reference and this has never irritated my skin ...in fact, I believe it calms it. 10 stars!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,This.Is.The.Best.Cleanser.You.Will.Ever.Buy.,"OMG!!! this stuff is AMAZING! It make my skin feel velvety soft and is not greasy or oily. It is great for acne prone skin! I’ve had acne for a while and I’m definitely seeking a huge improvement! the smell is very light, fresh and fruity. It goes on dry skin as a lotion and you add water to make it milky. I like to just wipe it off my skin with a wash cloth because it makes my skin feel moisturized without any greasy-ness! This stuff is a GOD SEND! don’t hesitate to buy it!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Doesn't clean well,"For a natural product, this has such a strong smell. It doesn't clean makeup very well. I still have to use regular soap to clean it. It's pointless really."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,new favorite!,"I ordered this cleanser to see if I could replace the pricey Tata Harper one I’m using.  This cleanser surpassed my expectations! I have dry skin that gets hormonal acne (yay!).  I need something nourishing yet effective, and this works.  I usually use this as a second cleanse, following a cleansing oil to remove make up.  I have not had any breakouts or irritations since using this cleanser.  There is no tightness when I use it either. It also won’t sting your eyes, unlike the Tata Harper cleansers. The smell is refreshing- like grapefruit."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,My new go to,"LOVE!! Clean product, no smell, feels great!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,a little pricey but it’s worth it!,"I have sensitive skin and sometimes I swear... the idea of leaving over the sink as night to wash my face is just too much (lazy? Yes!) I love applying this cleanser on dry skin, I massage it and I can literally see the the make up (I don’t wear much!) and impurities lift. I use a moist/wet micro fiber towel to wipe off, and if I need to I’ll do it twice. I can definitely tell my skin is adjusting to the cleanser and I love how clear and hydrated it feels now! The fact that it’s wildcrafted just makes me feel that much better about my decision to use it. Yes you can eat if (I tried) but I don’t think you should (it’s not exactly tasty hahaha)!

It’s a little pricey but you get a lot of product for the price. Plus the bottle itself feels expensive (glass). I’m very happy with my purchase :)"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Gentle Cleanser,This cleanser feels really nice and luxurious.  It is great at removing makeup and I love how gentle it is!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,Loved this product. Super gentle cleanser. Great for sensitive skin.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,"The consistency of this is similar to a lotion, which I find beneficial to my dry skin needs. It goes on smooth without tugging the skin like most cleansers, and the smell is beautiful and light. I wouldn't purchase this for makeup removal, since it doesn't work well. However, if you have dry skin, and don't wear makeup often, this is an amazing product. The amount you get for the price is fantastic as well."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Great gentle cleanser!,I love using this cleanser to melt away makeup at night. It leads feeling firm and soft without stripping your skin.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,This is by far one of the best cleaners I’ve tried in a while. It isn’t harsh on the skin and it doesn’t dry my skin out like most cleansers.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,"This always does a great job of really cleaning my skin and removing impurities without drying me out. The only issue I have with it is sometimes it stings a tiny bit when I put it on, but I think that's because my skin is naturally very dry."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Coconut oil/milk?,"I did use this cleanser, and it felt super gentle.  I just don’t feel comfortable to continuing using it because it contains coconut which clogs pores!! Being extremity acne prone, it’s not a risk I’m willing to take.  I think super dry or aging skin would like this, but not someone who has my skin type."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,"*disclaimer: I received this product from Edible Beauty via the #PreenMeVIP program in exchange for an honest review. 

I had heard so many good things about Edible Beauty so couldn’t wait to try it. I have somewhat oily skin on my t-zone and this cleanser over the past couple of weeks has decreased the oiliness. The cleanser is so gentle (I use it morning and night), and  smells amazing. I definitely recommend!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Best Face Cleanser,Definitely my favorite out of all the Edible Beauty products. This product is like a face wash and lotion all in one. I use this at night to wash  my skin and it take off all my makeup and grime from my face and leaves it feeling extremely soft and smelling lovely!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Gentle but powerful!,"I love this cleanser! It is gentle yet incredibly powerful and removes all my makeup to reveal a clean, smooth, bright face. 
I love how I smell after using it too. My new go-to cleanser for sure."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,"Awesome green, vegan cleanser!","This is a great alternative to using cleansing oils. It takes off makeup really well and smells great too. Love that it's green, clean, chemical free and vegan too!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,"Miracle product! I have sensitive/oily skin that likes to breakout a lot. I was using the Tatcha deep cleans and I could tell it was irritating things. I bought this based on the natural ingredients. I’ve been using it for three weeks now and I am simply amazed! My chin is no longer breaking out and my oily-ness has somewhat decreased! I cannot wait to buy the moisturizer! Give this a try if you’re fed up with unmanageable skin!!!  Oh, and not to mention it takes off every little bit of your make up! Easy peasy."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,not worth it,I returned not worth the price and the formula did not help my acne but made worse. Back to my old cleanser
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Great way to start the Day,"I'm a skincare addict, so when I tell you I have over 20 cleansers, I'm not kidding.  That's not counting my oil cleansers.  This is my new favorite.  It is my morning cleanse.  It smells like heaven.  I love this brand.  This is gentle enough that it doesn't leave my skin feeling stripped, but effective."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,"I love the cleansing cream,but the cheap dispenser is why I wouldn't give five stars. Everytime I  use the product,I need to screw off the dispenser and scoop out what I can. This is not very hygienic and could easily contaminate and ruin the product,should I even have water on my fingers digging it out of the bottle. The cleansing cream itself,is a perfect balance for my skin,not too drying and just enough moisture so my skin doesn't break out. It will be perfect here in the winter time. If it weren't for the dispenser problem,I probably would purchase again."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Absolutely Luxurious!,"This is the best cleanser I have ever used. It feels beautifully silky and penetrates deeply. After applying, add a little water and gently massage. This feels heavenly to do, then rinse. Belle Frais leaves your skin feeling delightfully cleansed, moisturised and soft. I have sensitive skin and this cleanser is so nurturing. Made from luxury botanicals with a lovely refreshing scent and ingredients so good you could eat. Use on its own or check out Edible Beauty's Core Four. You will never look back. I haven't."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,This cleanser transformed my skin!,"So glad I made the switch to this cream cleanser. It has completely balanced out my skin. It removes all makeup, smells delicious and leaves my skin soft and hydrated. No more irritation caused by foaming gel cleansers. Thank you for an amazing product!!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Absolute holy grail cleanser. Highly recommend.,"Absolute holy grail cleanser. This is gentle but very effective, it doesn't strip or leave a waxy film. My skin looks luminous since using this. Smells divine, so fresh! Plus the packaging is gorgeous and I know there's no nasty chemicals which is great for me and my baby!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,luxury in a bottle!,This product works wonderful as second cleanser due to its gentleness! I Use this after the Tata Harper regenerating cleanser and feel the tingle as it is super effective at cleaning pores as well! As always with the edible beauty products the smell is divine!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,"I wanted to upgrade my face wash, because I have a very shiny Tzone but dry cheeks, and based on the reviews, I decided to splurge for this face cleansing milk.
I should have read the instructions first before purchasing, because it says to apply onto DRY FACE and then wash with water.. I usually wash my face in the shower at night, so it's almost impossible to apply onto dry face.
But I had to give it a shot, so I used this product for about 3 days. On day #3, my face BROKE OUT. Not in the skin purge kind of way, but it was itchy bumps on my eye lid, cheekbone area, under my eyes.. places where I never get break outs.
I have stopped using this and the break out is better. So very disappointed that I wasted $42 on this ""so natural you can eat it"" product. :("
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,5/5,Love love love this product & toner. I have extremely oily & acne prone skin and usually have to take medication for acne. I am currently not using any medication and only these products and my skin has been awesome! I am so impressed. Edible beauty has a new customer for life!!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,"As a daily cleanser, I️ really like this product. It isn’t too much of any one thing. I️ find it to be very refreshing and use it day and night. I️ give it four stars because I️ don’t believe that it’s helped my skin in any specific way, just a nice gentle cleanser that is easy on my sensitive skin."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,"Beautiful bottle and packaging but I didn't feel like this did anything for my skin, and i'm not willing to pay that much money just for a pretty bottle so I returned it."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,,Creamy and Cleansing,Love how creamy this cleanser is. My face never feels dry after washing and my combination skin has improved significantly since using. Have repurchased multiple times and will continue to use. Highly recommended!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Edible Beauty No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,"I have sensitive, combination, and extremely acne prone skin. I was using a cleansing & care ritual (almost exclusively tatcha products) and had a massive flare up that wouldn’t budge regardless of what I did. My esthetician recommended I try to switch to cleansers that have very short ingredient lists and simplify my routine as much as possible. I now use this as my first cleanse & skin laundry’s foaming cleanser as my second and my skin is finally clearing up & calming down. I love it!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Surprisingly very drying!,"This cleanser smells citrusy and doesn't foam up at all which I didn't mind at all. However, I have really sensitive combination skin and this cleanser was too drying on my skin to the point that it started flaking. Also my pores became very clogged and I got some pretty bad under the skin breakouts. I like that this cleanser has great ingredients but it just didn't work well with my skin."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Love this organic skincare for my rosacea!,"I tried so many organic skincare that would calm my crazy rosacea skin, and my face will break out if using wrong skincare. When I saw this on this website, thought maybe not really good, boy I was wrong!! this made my skin look so amazing! My husband said he noticed my wrinkle forehead dinimished, it's like ""botox"" in whole skincare line of Edible Beauty! I am hooked! I ordered serum, lotion to go with this cleanser, it works beautifully! I love them so much it's my skincare staples!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Returned,Does not remove makeup and smells like oranges.Ill stick with gel cleansers.No more cream or milk cleansers for me they don't clean well.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Should be a lotion,"SMELLS SO GOOD! Unfortunately it doesn’t do a very good job of taking all my make up off, might use a different cleanser as my everyday and only use this when my skin is feeling dry. Don’t regret purchasing but maybe wouldn’t buy again. If this were a lotion though I would buy again and again, can’t say enough how good it smells!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,So So Nice,"I really love this cleanser. It was sold out and I ordered it from the website (which has some products that Sephora doesn’t carry) and tried it for the first time tonight. If you’re expecting lots of bubbles or the usual overly sweet scent that usually comes with cleansers, you will not get that. It it a very pleasant and smooth cleanser, cleaning your face without drying it. Feels a little like rubbing oil on your skin at first, but rinses off so nicely. The scent is super nice and herbal, very much like matcha/green tea. I’m looking forward to using this more along with the Soothe Me Balm from the company site. Love!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Love!,"I am all into natural ingredients, and I came from making my own facial cleanser and oils to moving to this one. If you are used to natural cleansers then this one is HEAVEN!! It feels like a nice lotion, and if you follow the instructions and use on dry skin, then lather and rinse, it feels amazing. It is even  surprisingly good at removing even eye makeup! No tight, oil stripped feeling either. I generally have oily skin, and I do have to say it felt like it helped balance it out. Overall: feels great, works great, smells great, and I LOVE the ingredients!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Luxury!,"So luxurious and leaves your skin feeling clean, and fabulous!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,USA,Please Keep This Brand and Send It To The Stores!,"Will. Change. Your. Life.
I have yet to find a gentle cleanser that does not strip my face or effectively remove impurities. It has helped my hormonal acne as well as dry skin (and I mean I wake up in the morning peeling if I forget to moisturize or use my oils) but I digress. The point is the coconut in this helps to hydrate without clogging pores and THE FIRST INGREDIENT IS WATER not alcohol!!!!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,,it is ok ,"it is ok. But definitely not great. so i don't think I will buy it again. I would say it is a very normal cleanser and does not impress me in any particular way. I am not saying that it is a bad product, but it simply does not surprise me. "
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,,DEFINITELY WORTH A TRY,It is very gentle on sensitive skin and all the ingredients are hypoallergenic. Worth the money as you will only need one to two pump per wash. It has natural citrus scent and does not leave your skin dry. 
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,,Smell and Too Stuck to Bottle,"The smell is not that great. I don't like the smell.

Nevertheless,  I continued to use it till it is at half-level. However I am not able to pump it out as it is too stuck to bottom. 

In order to get some milk out, I turned the bottle upside down overnight till the next evening. Still it is stuck to bottom. I was so pissed off.

By the way, I think that it is not pump-friendly that I have difficulty pumping it. 

I don't recommend it. Don't waste money on this. "
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,,Alright,"This cleanser is really gentle and has a slight scent. Comes in a very luxurious glass bottle, which might not be the easiest thing to handle in the shower. It is very milky and doesn't foam up much.

My issue with it is that it broke me out so bad, but it could just be my sensitive skin. Wish I could use it more. I'll be giving this away to someone else."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,,Milky and moiturizing,"Bought this because I was looking for a cleanser/makeup remover and the ingredients are clean which I love.
It doesn't leave a residue after washing it off too and it leaves skin feeling soft. The bottle is also made of glass and it's pretty big, so it can last for quite awhile and I only use 1 pump every night."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,,Not my favourite,"Not a bad product by any means.  It has a beautiful set of ingredients and isn't a bad second or morning cleanse, not good at removing makeup or sunscreen and the texture is perhaps a little on the lightweight side for my person preference.  However, is still a lovely non stripping skin cleanser. Also love the beautiful simple and elegant packaging, with lots of product for the money."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,,Ms,"Cleans well and very gentle on the skin. Rinses off nicely too, leaving the skin soft and not tight. But the milk dries up quite quickly when massaging onto face, thus requires a generous 3-4 pumps for me."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-No. 1 Belle Frais Cleansing Milk,,Gentle milk cleanser,"I like this milk cleanser. Gentle, smooth and not oily. I have tried other organic brand which the product consistency is thick and oily, not able to blend with water. This is not. It blends well with water after you massaged on dry face. Oh, forgot to mention that it has a mild fruity smell that I am mad in love with. Will repurchase!"
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",Singapore,great for backne,I have alot of small backne and this helps me put a stop to it or at least reduce the number of backne i have. It feels cooling when applied and has a strong calamansi smell to it. Might put off some people but i am ok with it.
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",Malaysia,good for back acne,"I used to have the back acne problem, until i found this lotion. It helps a lot and I can really see the improvement week by week. Do buy this if you have back acne issue. "
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",Malaysia,works,excellent for itches and body acne which is super annoying. it's calming. the consistency is very watery.  the smell is pretty medicinal and may not be for everyone

"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",Singapore,Ms,"Got this for my teenage son to be use together with the body soap. Applied with cotton pads after his shower.

"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",Malaysia,it works!,"This product does all it says. I applied it on a cotton bud everyday on my back when I had acne problems, and after 1-2 weeks the results were very visible and a while after it was all cured. I had only used around a quarter of the bottle then. Would recommend for anyone looking for a solution for body acne"
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",Malaysia,a special toner for body acne ,"first time trying this product as I have a terrible back acne and chest acne. I has strong herbal smell, but its okay for me. and when pour on cotton pad and clean those affected areas, the cotton pad would have black dots (i am not sure is it dirt) and the cotton pad would be brown yellowish. I think it is working to clean the dirt inside our skin pore."
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",Singapore,Good,The lotion helps to keep my body acne at bay and keeps skin calm. But it does not improve existing scarring from past acne. Has a strong medicated smell. 
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",Malaysia,does nothing,"I’ve been using this product for almost two months now and honestly had no effect. It didn’t stop my acne, and got the acne that grew on my back it didn’t dry it either. My scares are still there. It literally did nothing. Not worth the investment. Don’t buy it. "
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",Singapore,Cleansing Lotion ,This product helped reduce my body acne tremendously. I've been using this cleaning lotion along with the botanical body soap. Highly recommended to purchase. 
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",Malaysia,Exceptional result!!! ,"I have tried countless of products to treat backacne but the result were disappointed and my skin tend to be sensitive.

"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,cleanses troubled skin,I have a bit of acne on my back and shoulders which acts up every now and again. My acne marks have faded considerably upon using this product. requires consistent usage for better results
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,It works!,"Bacne has always been an issue for me, and I've tried a lot of products to control it. It usually appears on my shoulder area and bra line. This product really works to control it. After a few days of using, I notice the bacne heal and fade."

"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,Effective!,I was quite surprise this product actually gives a pleasant scent while reducing body acne. It has really help minimize my back acne in less than 3 weeks! Super happy!!!
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,not sure what’s good,I don’t think it does anything? Can’t see any effect from this product. Smells a bit funky also. I would use a cotton pad and swipe it on after my bath however it doesn’t seem to do much . It only feels cooling 
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,not worth,"doesnt do much, cant see any difference in my bacne. not worth the price and it smells very strongly of antiseptic. stings and ive not finished my bottle despite how long it has been. "
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,not that good,"I bought this product for my husband, he has a severe acne problem. But before i bought the item, i tried to use my Mario badescu Special cucumber lotion and acne lotion on his back. It dries the pimple fast, that’s why i bought this product because i thought it would bring the same effect but no."
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,good product,"Ever since i had my hands on this, i saw significant change on bacne. But it didnt stop acne from appearing, it just help to minimize the appearance. You may need another product to help on long term wise."

"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,O-yes!,"Another great product from Mario. This clearly helped with my backne and my chestne (chest acne. Not sure if there is such a word.) It drys down cool and makes the area feel clean. It does work if you are consistent. If you are not consistent then don't complain and  pass this
 to someone who will be. This works.
"
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,it works!,"I had bad back acne breakout after I got pregnant, and after application for over a month, the acnes dry up and are minimised! The smell is pleasant too!"
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,I love this product!,"While it didn’t eradicate my blemishes, I did see a difference albeit minimal. Perhaps with continued use the results would even be greater. What is immediate though, is that it seems to have stopped any new ones and it definitely felt good on my skin. "
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,Good,On my 2nd bottle of this already. This really helps with small pimples on your chest or back area. Does what it says. Try not to breathe when using it though it has v strong alcoholic smell.
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,powerful,I have back acne which is really bad and I used this twice and could see the diff. likes how it performs and also how it feels on the body ? I am surprised
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,It did not work at all,This product did not work at all for my skin. I have acne on my back and applying it did not make any difference to my skin. Im quite disappointed since it is also quite costly. 
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,BOMB ,BOMB PRODUCT . Acne cleared up within just days of using them . Usually apply them at night after a shower . Love the cooling sensation after application . Only downfall is that you kinda need someone to help out with the application . 
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,Not much difference,"Bought this for my backacne. On my 2nd bottle, been using it for almost half a year and I dont see much difference. I guess it works differently for different people. No harm to try it though, since it claims to have antiseptic properties. "
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,Worth the price,For the promise it delivers and the amount of product you get with this staple brand-- the price is very much worth it! I was surprised to see a pretty big bottle for just a grand pesos considering that it's Mario Badescu. I also love that medical spa-ish smell but it might be a love it or hate it to some.
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,great product,"After several days of trying this product, my bacne has cleared up a lot! It has an antiseptic kind of smell which would turn you off when you first used it. After awhile, you will grow accustomed to the smell. I will continue using it! "
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,Effective,Extremely effective for clearing up acne on chest and back. The herbal/medicinal smell after application might put some off at first but the smell will dissipate after a few minutes. It worked for me after two applications. Recommended.
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,a must-have to cure back acne,"Not only is my back prone to eczema, Singapore's humid weather aggravates this condition resulting in back acnes on my bra line.  I use it diligently for a week.  After shower, I dab this solution soaked on my cotton pad over the affected area.  After a few minutes, I LIGHTLY dab my body lotion to prevent any dryness that may result.  Results are promising.  My back is clear! IT DOES IT JOB WELL AND GOOD. I will definitely keep a bottle as standby. "
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,Leaking bottle,"I love this special lotion, repurchased it again and again. It really helps to clear up my back acne and does't dry and irritate my skin. But this time sephora sent me a leaking product and i dont know what to do! "
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,HOLY GRAIL FOR BACNE,I'm already on my third bottle of this! I go through this so fast- use it in the AM and PM and really love how it helps my bacne dry up. I can really feel the difference when I skip this a day or two! Good stuff!
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,dries up chest acne,"i’ve had chest acne for years and this is the first product i’ve used specifically targeted at chest acne. it took about 2 weeks to start seeing the difference, but now i can say that it really dried out the acne and i’ve got less redness on my chest. my scars are still there and i’ll give time to heal, but the acne itself has healed. the medicinal smell is strong but once you apply it, you won’t smell it after. "
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,Great product! ,"I have been struggling with body acne for years, especially on my back. There are not many products that target body acne, so I'm glad to have found this product that has helped clear them! It doesn't help much with the scars but it has definitely helped control the acne. I'm already on my third bottle since I use it in the morning and at night. Will definitely recommend this if you are struggling with the same problem as me! "
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,Effective for back pimples,"I bought the Cleansing ""O"" Lotion for my teenage son and so far, it has kept to its promise.  Pimples on his upper arms and back were kept at bay.  He is already on his second bottle and it is still serving its purpose on his skin problem.  "
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,Clears body acne,Not many products available for back acne. clears acne but not the scar. Like the herbal smell. Safe for whole family and effective. Good to have this product on standby although the price is on the high side.
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,strong medicinal smell but works! ,"it has a strong medicinal smell but if you can take it (it goes away after awhile), it works to dry up back acne. I find it difficult to use a cotton pad so what I do is, i pour a small amount onto my palms and spread it across my backs so much as i am able to reach them.

"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,nice,"I have been struggling with back and chest issues for many years, so I purchased this with a 40% discount code. You need to shake it before use as there is a lot of white sediment that settles. Really like its strong astringent-herbal scent! "
"MARIO BADESCU-Special Cleansing Lotion ""O""",,Special cleansing lotion,"I used this on my back acne, but after using diligently for almost 2 months, I don't see any difference or improvement. Honestly, I do not think it is worth the price. A little disappointing given the great results I had using other Mario Badescu products. "
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,Singapore,Orange facial soup,Bought during sale.  Haven't really use it. Opened the cap and smelled but couldn't smell anything orange. Planned to use it after I have finish my existing facial wash.  Hopefully it is good.
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,Malaysia,worst,Literally hate this cleanser. It’s so thick I mean the consistency. I had to wash my face with water all over for 2 times to remove the excess stain. Literally does nothing to my face. It’s not worth the hype 
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,Malaysia,so so,Bought this to try the mario badescu range.found the soap to have a weird smell.does only a fair job at cleaning my face.did not strip off all my make up
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,Singapore,The,I usually like products from mario badescu. But this one has a weird texture and doesnt feel remotely like a cleanser. I would recommend the acne cleasing one instead. This one doesnt make my skin feel clean- just weird textures and smell all around
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,Singapore,cream like cleanser,"It's not a soapy/foamy cleanser. however, it is gentle on my sensitive skin and leaves my skin soft, moisturised and  clean after every wash. will recommend this to my friends!"
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,The cleansing soap is....,It does not irritate my skin when I use it for my face but it didn’t do anything much as well. A pea sized application mixed with water goes a long way so one purchase will probably last months depending on how frequent you use it. 
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,So good,"I super love this item! It' has a luxurious, velvety feel. I haven't had any new breakouts since I started using this. Smells great and is very gentle."
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,hate it,I hate this so much. I honestly don't know what to do with it. It feels so heavy and greasy and leaves so much residue on your skin. I try to double cleanse with it but end up having to triple cleanse to get it all off!
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,Combination skin,"Works wonder! Love it. My skin getting smoother each day. No more dry skin around my nose area. The bottle is quite big, will probably last for 3 months at least. Worth every penny! My skin feels clean after using it."
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,stay away,Bought during massive discount sale. I cannot say any good thing about this cream like cleanser. Smell absolutely awful and the smell lingers after wash. Strongly suggest to stay away from this product.
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,moisturising but not clean,This face wash texture is like a lotion . When I wash my face it doesn’t clean fully . It can’t remove any makeup leftovers on your face . But if you’re looking for something moisturising this is the product for u. It’s suitable for sensitive skin . 
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,gentle wash,"This facial wash is a pretty gentle wash, very decent for everyday use. Though personally, I'm not a fan because it doesn't lather so well and sometimes, I need my lather. I also don't like the scent so much"
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,Meh,"I usually do skin peels and my dermatologist suggested that I use a cleanser without harsh acids. When I showed her the ingredients for this, she okayed it. This cleanser is good for skin without any makeup on it. Trying to remove my makeup using this was a massive chore and I had to rewash my face with my usual cleanser to remove the sticky mix it formed with the makeup. Maybe I should have tried to remove the makeup/cleanser mix with cotton wool first. Nonetheless, it is a good simple cleanser on my plain skin, not a good makeup remover."
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,Superb for Dry Skin,"I'm having a dry skin for a very long time. Been changing products to products. Saw this Mario and I said why not give it a try cuz I know if the ingredient has orange in it, it will help to cure my dry skin. Plus it was not easy to find skincare with orange treatment. And yes! It help to reduce the dryness of my skin. If you want your skin feel soft and mosturize after cleansing, just apply Mario on your skin. Gently massage and wait for like 3 mins to let the ingredient absorb onto your skin. Then wash with water. I usually use medium to cold water cuz it will help to reduce pores. I used 1 bottle of Mario for 6 months. So great! Now waiting for my 2nd bottle from Sephora. "
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,my staple,"I like this product quite a lot. It helps to brighten my skin significantly and not drying. After using for a few months, I find my skin has improved. I would definitely recommend this. My sensitive skin doesnt react too."
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,MB Orange Cleansing Soap,"non-drying & does it's job well! skin feels soft & clean after every wash, perfect for daily cleansing. the smell's quite nice too. suitable for almost all skin types & would definitely purchase again."
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,it's a no for me,One of my least favorites from this brand. Don't like the scent and also the feeling it leaves afterwards. It's a cleanser but it leaves my skin feeling like it needs another cleansing after using this. 
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,it's kind of work,"Have been use this for a week , it works I can tell. It leaves your skin moisturised for a day. The texture is a bit weird but it cool , kinda love it. My skin doesn't feel tight which I love the most. Maybe I'll repurchase this product in the future.    "
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,Absolute favorite!,This is my first item from this brand and I am very very satisfied.  This cleansing soap is non-drying and my skin feels really soft.  I will for sure re-purchase and try other products from this brand.  Love to try their toners and masks.
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,Not suitable for me,"I'm giving this product a 2.5 star because it doesn't work on me - my face still feels oily after using it, however I don't get any breakouts from it. It should be effective on those with normal to dry skin. I have combination skin - oily T-zone and dry on the cheeks and mouth area."
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,Ineffective for oily skin,"I have oily skin and this cleanser does absolutely nothing for me. In fact, it leaves a sort of film on my skin after cleansing. Also, the smell is absolutely horrendous. I'm not sure if it's just my bottle because I generally like the smell of orange extract, but it smells like puke every time I use the product."
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,Great,"The Orange Cleansing Soap is all in all a great item. It leaves my skin soft without drying it out. One bottle lasts quite a while so its also value for money. However, I do need to use a makeup remover beforehand as it doesn't remove especially waterproof makeup. "
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,Cleanser,"Gentle Yet Effective
- Jenny walker
I was hesitant to buy this product because of the mixed reviews about it, but since I needed a gentle facial cleanser that I can use with my Olay Megasonic, I gave this a shot. When it arrived, its a big bottle so I wont need to repurchase as much. The texture is creamy and doesnt lather into foam. Its really gentle. After rinsing, my skin feels clean. No tight feeling whatsoever and I dont feel any residue or greasy feeling. The scent kinda put me off as it smelled a bit like crayon with a very faint orange. Nice grab tho."
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,Not my bottle of miracle.,"Great for dry/mature skin. I find this unsuitable for combination or oily skin types. Doesn't wash off easily. It leaves and oily film after. And I broke out in a rash, not suitable for sensitive skin I suppose.  But as with all beauty products, different skin will react differently.  Try at your own risk. "
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,good cleanser for sensitive skin,it is a cream cleanser and cruelty free. i have been using it for almost a month now and i do not experience any breakouts or feeling of tightness on my skin so far. the scent is extremely mild too. overall  i think it is a good value for money cleanser as it can last for a long time.
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,Lovely cream cleanser,"This is a great value for money.

I initially didn't like it as it felt that it was too ""greasy"". After experimenting for a while, I find that this is a great makeup remover. I use it to take off my eye makeup and it doesn't sting my eyes.

This is a very thick cleanser. I keep it upside down so that it's easier for me to squeeze the bottle to get the product. I use it directly on my face, in circular motions. Then i will wet my hands and repeat the circular motions on my face. My makeup practically ""melts"" off. I do like my skin squeaky clean, so I will still follow up with my normal cleansing routine after using this product."
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,Great hype,"Of all cleanser I used, this works best. No doubts! Get this and it works wonder. The scent could workout for the better. It would be great to use botanical scent instead of orange. Creamy texture, it smells quite awesome at first especially for those who first used. "
MARIO BADESCU-Orange Cleansing Soap,,Mario Badescu Orange Cleansing Soap,"This is a cream cleanser mildly exfoliating and very refreshing. It is non-oily, non-detergent formula and is safe and effective for all skin types. I use it to remove makeup and build-up from the skin without drying. This is one of my many favorite cleansers from Mario Badescu!"

MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,Singapore,has a weird smell,"it cleanses, doesn’t dry out skin but has a funky smell to it. guess it’s the seaweed? but yea, i don’t think i’ll be repurchasing this anytime soon lol."
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,Malaysia,Not so good on me,"Smells bad, and after using it my face will be quite dry. And a little feeling of my skin gonna “cracks”, and it smells quite chemically, and artificially… not suitable for my skin, have been using the other cleansing soap from this brand, the other one were quite good. "
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,Philippines,Mild Cleanser,"Super mild. It does not lather up, but it does make the skin feel cleaned and moisturized after. It does not totally remove makeup, so I suggest double cleansing when using this."
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,Singapore,Ok cleanser ,"Bought it because i was intrigued by the colour and the seaweed ingredients. Works fine, not too drying. Probably will only repurchase during sales though. "
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,Singapore,soft cleanser,"its rather creamy, so i think its actually pretty good for sensitive skin. it doesn't feel tight or dry after cleansing my face. Has like small seaweed bits which can be used as a gentle exfoliant.not much of a smell which is good,having fragrance in skincare is a huge no for me. Gave 4 because I did find a better product at a lower price point."
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Mario Badescu Cleanser,"This cleanser comes in a fuss-free truly no-frills kind of bottle which looks somewhat clinical, which does not distract from the actual product. The smell may not be pleasing to some, and at least for me it was an acquired smell. Nonetheless, does its job as a cleanser-cum-exfoliator if you’re looking for one without frills."
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Seaweed Cleansing Soap,One bottle can last a good 6 months. i have dry combination and sensitive skin. this has somehow helped to calm my skin and my skin feels clean after rinsing. 
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,"Soft, Nourishing","Really soft and hydrating cleanser. Gentle to skin. However, need to use makeup remover to completely remove makeup first. Suitable for dry, sensitive skin"
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,I hate the packaging,I wasted a lot of the product because it was so difficult to estimate my strength while pouring. It smells nice and is gentle on my skin but would not  get it again unless it comes with a pump instead 
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Nice & Gentle,"Nice gentle product! Removes traces of makeup, cleanses face without face feeling stripped or dry. No soap hence making it pretty gentle. I really like it ! "
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Does the job,"I have no issues with the cleansing soap. If you are looking for a cleanser that suds up, this isn't the one for you. It gently cleans the skin. It has seaweed beads inside and may sort of cos a slight mess in the basin so keep that in mind. also, it does smell of seaweed hence if you dont like that scent, stay away. Other than that, no complaints."
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Hydrating,"I used this first time along with my new foreo, I have super duper dry skin hence I have eczema spots on my face - right of the first use my face were instantly hydrated, my eczema did not react to it, and it didn’t itch the whole day, but I felt like it made my face a little bit oily, though Im not sure if that was an oily face felt cause I’v never been one 😣, also i was expecting it to be bubbly like a typical soap, but no it didn’t bubble no mater how may i put into my face, i just hope they put instruction in the bottle on how many amount should you put into your face. But it still works so id still use it, but maybe not everyday.  "
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Mario badescu ,Love this product. One of the best lines available on sephora in their skin care line. It removes all the left over makeup and oil and dirt. A very good cleanser. 
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,okay,"did not notice any difference in skin when i used this, smelt a little weird but acceptable. will not be purchasing again as cheaper alternatives can be found. but it lasted really long
"
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,non drying cleansing soap,Im giving this product a 4 star.when i use this cleanser it doesn’t dry the skin.leaves my skin feeling clean n moisturized.unlike other cleansers which leaves my skin tight and dry.will repurchase
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Ms,"Not feeling irritating even close to eye area, meaning it has done a rather good job already considering my skin is sensitive to many other cleansing products. My skin type is more prone to dry side but bit oily only at nose area. It's a ok product but  It didn't wow me. Good to try out "
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Not worth the price tag,Don't fancy the smell of this cleanser and also it isn't anything special. Could easily find other cheaper alternatives that works equally well or even better.
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Worth Every Cent!,"Best face wash from Mario Badescu so far... For everyday use. It does not dry out my skin, very moisturising. The scent is not bothersome. The only con is the bottle cap lol wish they could’ve made it like the Glycolic Foam cleanser packaging. It can get a little messy. But the product itself? For what it claims and actually does? Worth every cent! "
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Does not dry out the skin,"I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to start a new skin regimen. The soap works well,  non greasy... it does not dry out the skin. I am pleased with this product and will happily purchase again."
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,No difference,"I find this product not helping me in any way. The smell is not great either. On top of it all, there’s no clean feeling after using it. The seaweed granules, or I assume so, is just there, doesn’t seem to be of any use. Won’t repurchase again."
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,fresh,"I love the seaweed bits that cleans and moistures my skin . Super affordable, and I have sensitive skin but this cleanser works well for me.   I can also remove my makeup with this face wash .  It can last me about 12 months or more & leaves my face feeling FRESHHHHH & soft !! "
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,okay,"i have combi skin and it didn't work out for me. but its reasonably priced, mild scent and calming to the skin, ok as an exfoliator, kind of gives an oily feeling after cleansing?, won't die if you didnt try this product out 
 "
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,not used to it,"Brought this ranges during sales, so decidedly to give it a try including the cleaser , toner & moisturizer.

No used to the texture and smell(no fragrance)
 So I believe it work better but yet to see any results."
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,great cleanser ,This is a great cleanser and doesn’t over strip my skin and leave it feeling clean and my sensitive skin doesn’t react to this which is great! However the bits and pieces gets stuck to my foreo and impossible to remove. Not recommended to use it with foreo.
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,I like this!,"I like this product quite a lot. It helps to brighten my skin significantly and not drying. After using for a few months, I find my skin has improved. I would definitely recommend this. My sensitive skin doesnt react too."
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,ok,I bought this because I want to an alternate with my current facial wash because it’s so expensive. It’s okay but not squeeky clean. I felt it did not remove any dirt on my skin. But the smell is nice just not for me I will stick to Benefit. 
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Nice but not for me,"I find it a bit drying for a cleanser but the disappointing part is that after I wash my face with this one, is that there's a lot of make up residues left 
:/ I know use this as a morning cleanser w/c just fine"
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Just.... no,"Had high expectation but it broke me out & stung my eyes really badly. Face felt sooooo tight and dry, stuck with almost a 3/4 used bottle... prolly one of my least fav thing that I’ve tried from Sephora. 
"
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Gentle exfoliant,"Mario Badescu is one of the few brands i trust when it comes to skin care. I am a regular user of the Enzyme cleansing gel and this is my alternative for days when i want to exfoliate my skin. needless to say, you can expect glowing skin - minus the very chemical feel - with this product."
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,good but ,"It’s good, makes my skin softer. But the smell is a little different from what I used before, quite strong for a facial wash. a small amount will do the whole face since its thick. Definitely worth for the price. 

"
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Good,A good product. I always use this for everyday use. Good for sensitive skin like me makes my skin soft and clean. This will last for months. I would repurchase again will recommend it to others :) I just wish there is a travel size for this because it is a bit big to carry for travel.
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,I ADORE THIS,"Should be in every girl’s skin care regimen....makes skin more supple and babylike. I use this two times a day, one in the morning and evening. Will be ordering this after after  my I finish my bottle. This cleansing soap is also best in removing stubborn make up. The scent is very  pleasant and not over powering. "
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Best Cleaning Soap ,The best cleanser gentle on my skin.After I used this cleaner my face can feel soft and moisturise. When I start using the time I don’t really like the smell but after a week already used to it and it’s  protect from sun burns as well.I really love it and definitely I will recommend to my friends!!!
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,cleanser ,"A good face wash that leaves my skin fresh , not tight feeling.  acts as a mild facial scrub as well, however i do not fancy the scent of this products. would prefer mario's botanical cleanser over this. still a decent cleanser thou. "
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,THE BEST,"This is the best cleansing soap that I have ever tried in Mario Badescu!! I just don’t like its case but other than that, everything about this product has been helpful for me. I have an oily skin and I had problems with pimples before. After finishing this product, I definitely saw the improvements"
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Great for exfoliating,"This product saved me from post sunburnt skin.. I went to the beach for my vacation leave, turned into a tomato and started peeling like crazy by the time I got back for work. It was pretty awkward 'cause I work in retail and have to face clients on a regular. I used this product morning and night and by two days my face was back to normal :) "
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Clean Fix!,It's a good face wash that leaves my skin fresh -- there is a strong scent that reminds me of cleaning products but other than that I like this product although I feel like there are better face wash options available.
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Best facial cleanser! Value-for-money!,"I have combination skin which is also very dehydrated so I have been trying richer and gentle cleansers. 
- this cleanses really well and yet does not dry out skin 
- does not leave a filmy layer though it's richer in texture 
- skin feels good and not taut 

Definitely a good buy! Definitely bang for the buck! 
 
Minus 0.5 star for the 'fragrance'... heh heh "
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,So gentle on the skin!,Love this cleanser as it doesn't strip my skin of its natural oils. Leaves my skin feeling really soft and smooth. The small grains in the cleanser also gently exfoliates the skin. Would definitely recommend it!
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Good overall facial cleanser.,One of my staple cleanser. It's gentle enough to double/triple wash your face with this cleansing soap without irritating the epidermis. However I'm not a fan of the soft gummy like seaweed bits rubbing against my skin while washing it. This is a good alternative in case the enzyme cleanser goes out of stock.
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,gentle but not foaming,"This cleanser is gentle with small particles to gently exfoliate the skin. It is a creamy cleanser without foaming property.  It provides anti-inflammatory benefits to provide slight benefit to my acne prone skin. It is easy to rinse, and it is great for sensitive skin as well. "
MARIO BADESCU-Seaweed Cleansing Soap,,Mario Badescu Seaweed Cleansing Soap,"This cleanser is mild and gently exfoliating. It is thick and creamy cleanser contains mineral-rich, anti-inflammatory Seaweed Extract. I have sensitive skin, and have been using this twice per day. It works well on my sensitive skin! "
KOPARI-Tropical Glow Cleanser,Australia,good cleanser ,This is a good cleanser. Smells nice and lathers well. Makes my skin feel clean afterwards but not dry and tight. Little bit of a splurge but if you can get it on sale it’s a good one 
KOPARI-Tropical Glow Cleanser,Malaysia,Kopari - tropical glow cleanser ,"Kopari - tropical glow cleanser 

A very normal unimpressive face cleanser. Will not repurchase. Not the best consistency and upon contact with water didn’t wash nicely either "
KOPARI-Tropical Glow Cleanser,Malaysia,Smelled nice and clean really well but feeling a little dry after,Smelled really nice but personally it was a little pungent. It left my skin feeling really clean but also abit dry. Container was designed to dispense a lot but you don’t need a lot to clean. 
KOPARI-Tropical Glow Cleanser,Australia,divine,Smells like a tropical vacay! This cleanser is a must have for the coconut- obsessed! Big fan of kopari and this is a win. Works well when paired with a cleansing brush.
KOPARI-Tropical Glow Cleanser,Malaysia,kopari,"Bought this during sales and I liked it! Smells like coconut, think pina colada and holiday mood. Skin feels smooth after cleansing and doesn't feel tight or dry. Will consider to repurchase "
KOPARI-Tropical Glow Cleanser,Singapore,consistency a little thin,Smells good and washes well but always leaks out of the tube which is frustrating and wasted product. Skin does feel very glowy afterwards so that works well.  
KOPARI-Tropical Glow Cleanser,Malaysia,Not super great ,"This cleanser is not the best from this brand to me personally. The Kopari cleansing oil is way better. This cleanser gave me minor breakouts when I first started using it, it’s hard to open because it’s in a tube and I feel like my face is not cleansed properly after using. The pros? It does smell great & it has great value for money."
KOPARI-Tropical Glow Cleanser,Australia,"good price, would definitely buy again","Love the smell of this product, makes me feel like in on holiday. I like the gel consistency and only need a small amount. I use in conjunction with my face cleansing egg and foams up nicely and works well together. Lasted for ages so good value for money"
KOPARI-Tropical Glow Cleanser,Malaysia,glow,"I love using my tropical cleanser daily, it doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry or tight and it smells like I’m on a vacation. Love it so much.  It has been gentle on my sensitive skin, though hasn't been particularly useful in clearing up breakouts. Overall I like it though!"
STARSKIN-ORGLAMIC™ Celery Juice Healthy Hybrid Cleansing Balm,Singapore,"Nope, no thanks…","This is one of the worst products I have bought from Sephora. Horrible consistency, not big on the smell, not satisfying to use at all… It claims to be able to remove heavy makeup but it does not do a very clean job, leaving greasy stains all over my face which is hard to remove with warm water. I tried using a washcloth too but my cloth gets stained and it cannot wash off easily. 1 star for it being a Green product. 
If you are looking for a balm to oil cleanser, heres my all time recommendation: Eve Lom cleanser beats this handsdown anytime!"
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,Singapore,Convenient and cleanse well ,This package is super convenient compared to the balm in a tub packaging. It’s compact and easy to pack along for travelling. Works well to take off heavy make-up. Will repurchase
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,Canada,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,Purchased two of them since they are on sale. I use it for my morning to really massage my face while cleaning. Somehow balm cleanser works better on my skin.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,Canada,Excellent Gel Balm,I LOVE this cleanser. I use it in the morning for a gentle cleanse and it makes my skin so clean and soft. I have oily skin but I find using oils really helps overproduction. It does have quite a strong clove smell but it does not bother me. If you are sure to wet your face beforehand it works best. I have not tried to use it to take makeup off yet but that is not why I purchased it. I like this so much I have a backup ready to go.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,Canada,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,I really loved the sample of this I received so I purchased the full bottle. The bottled product was a little different? I checked to see if I purchased the right product because I was confused and I did! The sample had a different texture and it came with a cotton cloth with I loved. It does take makeup off easily but not worth it. Disappointed and won't be purchasing again.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,Canada,"Controversial, but lovable","(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) After using the sample, I can tell this is a love it or hate it deal. Sample before you buy. If the smell doesn't irritate you, the cleanser certainly won't. My skin is SUPER sensitive and loves this stuff. The damp muslin cloth is used is used to pat the balm off your skin, and man is it a beautiful result. My skin is NOURISHED as well as clean. So it's a love for me."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,A good sequel to the original,"I love this product. I’ve used the traditional Eve Lon cleanser, so I like the smell. Removes makeup and doesn’t break me out. Leaves my skin soft. I prefer the oil cleanser but this is definitely something I’d like to keep stored for travel and mornings when I’m short on time."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,Canada,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,"No this product does not smell great, but the key is to use a generous amount and emulsify it with water. Then it turns into a creamy, milky foam that gently cleanses the skin without stripping it. For the gentle yet thorough cleansing, I can put up with the scent."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,This cleanser stinks. I used it once and had to return. I couldn’t get over the smell.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,"Although it's a bit pricy as cleanser, I will buy it again. It leaves my skin hydrating while does a good job remove the makeup."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,If you don't like Cloves stay away from this!!,"I love the Eve Lon cleanser that you use with a muslin cloth so this form intrigued me. First lots of negative reviews due to the scent. It's cloves and hops which for many would be off putting but I didn't mind it. 
Second, it has lots of different oils in it so for my dry skin not a problem. Thirdly, it's a gel balm which isn't going to lather much but massaging this onto my wet skin was nice and I rinsed this off using warm water followed by a cold splash of water which seals in the moisture.
I use a half pump and I don't put this near my eyelids. I find many oil cleansers kind of mess with my vision so I just clean my under eye area. No residue, no need for second clean. I find my moisturizer seeps in better after using this cleaner. I recommend this highly for sensitive dry flakey skin because it's gentle and not irritating."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,"I swear by this cleanser!!! I have never found a cleanser that works for my very sensitive, easily dried out, also prone to breakouts, type skin."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,,ugh,oh my. i dont know what to say. firstly hate the smell it is super weird but it is not bad cleanser wise if you could take the smell. i wont re purchase
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,,Love this! ,My skin loves this! It deep cleanses without stripping moisture. It has an earthy scent that I don't mind considering how good this is. This was a repurchase. It's on my HG list together with the Fresh cleanser which I use in the morning and this in the evenings. Perfect morning & night combi for great skin.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,wouldn’t use this again,Did nothing for my skin. Didn’t feel cleansed after using.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,melts down makeup,"This removes all traces of makeup effectively and leaves the skin nourished and bright! The ingredients list and short and I like that, simple and efficient. I use this as my first cleanse in my double cleanse routine. I also really love the muslin cloth used with this. I received this product complimentary but all opinions are my own"
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Wouldn't purchase in the future,"this product was gentle on my skin but was not something I loved.  The packaging was decent, nothing special.  Can't complain about an overwhelming fragrance from the product but I don't think this is something I would purchase in the future."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser,"I thought this cleanser was okay. I didn't love the smell, very strong and not very pleasant, but it felt nice on my skin. I did feel I needed to double cleanse with this as it didn't remove everything."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Not in love,"I’m always eager to try new products, especially skincare. I tried this cleanser in a different form that came in a tube container with a twist-off cap. The packaging was very easy and convenient to use, but the product itself didn’t do much for me. I wear a lot of makeup and need a cleanser that can effectively remove my base makeup, and this only removed some of it. If you wear minimal makeup, this might work better for you. Definitely not for someone who does a full glam look."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,I love!,Absolutely in love with the packaging and branding. Not personally a fan of the smell BUT the results are incredible. Removed all of my makeup and left my skin feeling so soft and fresh. I’m a fan and would actually continue to buy this.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,def recommend,"I received the full size as a free sample and I will definitely be purchasing it again and in the mini size as well! I’m not personally crazy about the smell, but the results are unreal. It fully takes off all my makeup and leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean right before bed!"
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,"I have very dry skin and this takes off my makeup very well without stripping my skin or feeling drying. I love the texture and packaging. I would recommend if you have sensitive or dry skin, not sure about acne prone. I was gifted this product by EVE LOM."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,"I have read a lot of great reviews on this and wanted to try this out for so long. Finally I received this product as a free sample. After I wash, my face feels soft and moisturized. Most mascara comes off but I personally prefer to use an eye makeup remover for my eyes. It melts like butter on my face and my skin feels hydrated! Love this product so far! It might not for you if you are sensitive of fragrance."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,if you don't like the smell of clove oil don't buy,"This product gets a lot of bad reviews for the smell, so if you don't like the smell of clove oil don't buy this. Personally I don't mid the smell of clove so the scent is a non issue. Now with that out of the way I have adopted this as my new pre cleanser and morning cleanser, because it does a great job removing make up and sunscreen with out stripping my dry skin. It is not as thick and viscus as their original cleanser which I didnt really care for much. It is a gel like balm and melts into my skin and rinses easily with a face cloth. I also prefer the pump package to the original's lidded jar. I took a star off because it's unnecessarily expensive."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,"Nice Product Performance, Unpleasant Scent","As a devotee to clean beauty products I am used to using products that can perform well but not smell very appealing.  This cleanser isn't a clean beauty product and smells like its gone bad. The texture is nice, the color is unique for cleanser (a blue-ish green), but I can't get past the scent.  The pump dispenser works well. The product leaves my mature skin feeling soft and not stripped. If you can hold your nose and wash your face at the same time, you may like it. Glad I bought a mini, won't re-purchase."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,"good that i got a sample to try it out this product first. My first impression when I squeeze the product into my palm, it looks like phlem, the texture and colour doesn't look appealing. Then when I put on to my face, it smells so horribly that i need to wash it out right away. I have never used such as bad smell product on my face."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,great light cleanser,"I was looking for a ""cleaner"" gentle new morning cleanser to alternate with a physical exfoliant cleanser and this is perfect. its literally a cross between a gel and a balm, light and not too stripping but removes all the prior nights product. the smell is herbal bordering on medicinal, some people hate it but it doesn't bother me. I took off one star because of the bulky unnecessary plastic packaging and the price, which is obviously because of the over the top packaging."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Stick with the original,"I'm a fan of the ORIGINAL Eve Lom cleanser, I've been using it for over a decade a few times a week when my skin is congested or I just need a pick me up. I purchased this in the hopes it was something I could use in the shower or when I didn't have time for the full ritual. 

The consistency is a creamy version of the original, which is more of a solid balm. I tried to use it with wet hands as directed and it really did nothing. My makeup just smeared around and my skin didn't feel clean. I tried using it with dry hands as a first step in a double cleanse, and that worked,  but that defeated the purpose of being able to use it wet.

It's not necessarily a bad cleanser, but I'm not sure what purpose it serves. I would skip it completely and just invest in the original Eve Lom Cleanser which is phenomenal.

As far as the scent - I happen to love it. It's VERY herbal, but not in an artificial way. The original cleanser smells similar, so if that's what you don't like, don't bother. I happen to associate the smell with self-care, so I hope they don't change that."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,"Many people complained about the smell; I was okay with the smell, though I'd prefer something more pleasant. I'm giving this product a one star because 1) it did not clean my skin well and 2) it made my skin dry every time I used it. For those of you who have dry/combo skin, I suggest you to avoid using this product."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,"I got this as a sample. Tried it one night, noticed the awful scent. Gave it second chance. The second night, couldn’t tolerate the scent. Threw it out!"
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,"This is a no...just no. 

I tried a sample and used it twice. It smells AND it broke me out. I have little bumps and texture where I don't normally have them. They weren't there yesterday. This is the only new product I used in my routine. I never break out from anything. My skin isn't sensitive at all. I feel like it didn't cleanse my skin either. So glad I only tried a sample and didn't waste my money on this product."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,"I got a sample of this and unfortunately I opened and tried it. I can’t comment on the cleansing properties because I couldn’t get past the smell which was, in a word, appalling."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Oil slick city,"I’ve never hated a sample enough before to write a review...but I loathed this. I’ve used—and liked—other oil-based cleansers before. This literally left an oil slick on my eyeballs, despite squeezing my eyes tightly shut, as I always do while washing my face. I had to double cleanse with my regular cleanser just to get this off my face. Not to mention the smell: I actually like cloves, but I don’t ever want to smell this again. No, thank you, all around."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Amazing Cleanser for Acne,"I received this cleanser as a sample and was blown away by how fast it cleared up my acne. I have very acne-prone skin. I immediately bought the full size and it is my go-to cleanser, and I am pleased to say that a few weeks later, my skin is looking so much healthier and clearer. Please disregard the bad reviews on smell - I could care less what this smells like for the benefits it provides."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,LOVE IT!!!,"I've been looking for a cleanser that is gentle enough for sensitive skin, but strong enough to remove makeup without drying out my skin.  I'm so glad I came across this product because it is exactly what I need and more.  I only use one pump to get everything off my face, waterproof liner and long-lasting lipstick as well, and it leaves my skin clean and soft.  I've noticed my pores have gotten smaller and my blackheads have disappeared.  I've never had such great results right away when using a new product and I am just thrilled about this one.  Usually new products clean my skin but leaves it dry and tight and eventually gets flakey.  Or just the opposite--my skin doesn't get dry, but then the product doesn't end up removing all the makeup and dirt.  With this product I love everything about it and I really do love how my skin looks and feels.  Thank you Eve Lom!!  (p.s.  There is no bad or strong scent from this product at all as I've read in other reviews.)"
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,The worst cleanser I've ever tried...,"Does nothing for my face, except leave a sticky film on it! it doesn't clean, it leaves crap on my face, and it smells awful."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Love it,I love this stuff! Cleans all of my make up off in one try. Great smell. Creamy consistently that leaves my skin feeling clean yet moisturized.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Good but smells,Smells bad but it takes off all the stubborn makeup without using any other products leaving it really clean.  It’s also really gentle on the face.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,meh,"Good product I like the idea of it but it smells awful. I would use as my morning cleanser. I can usually get past the scent of something if it works but this is just a cleanser, it’s meant to remove makeup, oil, debris, etc. Nothing is staying on the skin so there is no real long term benefits. I think it’s overpriced. Pretty packaging looks fancy but not worth the $$ for me. I prefer a Japanese brand cleansing oil."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,"Phenomenal cleanser! It removes ALL my makeup including my mascara. Use this with a cleansing brush, rinse very well and boom! CLEAN. Miracle cleaner hands down!"
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Love it!,Everyone is fussing over the smell. It honestly does not bother me at all. This makes my face feel amazing after I rinse it with a warm washcloth. A little goes a long way. It is a gel balm cleanser so it isn't made to lather and suds up. I will repurchase soon.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,smells sooo bad,the smell was so horrible. I honestly can't say how well works since I had to wash it right off. the smell was something like something had rotted. the worst part is my skin still smelled of it after I used a second cleanser.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,"I tried Eve Lom’s original cleanser and love it! When this came out, I had to try it and I was not disappointed at all. My skin is acne prone and it deep cleans brilliantly. Use with a Clarisonic and it will make your skin so smooth. No breakouts and reduced my blackheads!"
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Amazing,"This is truly the best makeup remover I’ve ever used. It gets every bit of makeup off and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. I’ve used the original balm cleanser as well, but find this formula more convenient as it’s in a pump bottle. I don’t love the smell but it doesn’t linger and the pros outweigh the cons for sure."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,pickles and turpentine,"The scent of this is awful, something reminiscent of turpentine, pickles and maybe gasoline. It works well as a first cleanse or am cleanse, but would not purchase ever again, just based on scent alone. It gets 2 stars due to the fact that it works decently well at cleansing."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,"Clean, clear and even skin.","I tried this first as a generous-sized sample. My skin cleared within 2 days of using this cleanser- clear and even. Much had been made of the scent - once you know it’s cloves, it doesn’t bother at all, I quite enjoy it. What I most enjoy though  is clean, clear, even skin! I am now using the full size version, and again, my skin cleared right up. Love it."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Nasty smell... unless you love Cloves,"Ugh..used a sample size on my vacay...gross. Smell was awful (it's Clove - YUCK). So distracted by the smell and the goopy texture, I couldn't even tell if it got my makeup off. Just wanted this cleanser off my face."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,I got a sample of this product for free and now i am really concidering spending $$$ to get more. It made my skin super soft and my pores were less notacebel. Recomend.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Dry Skin Savior!,"This balm is meant to be applied to damp skin, its absolutely loaded with nourishing Shea-butter after washing with this cleanser off i feel extremely soft and comforted not stripped, just clean and hydrated! I personally enjoy the smell of the clove however i don't judge product based on natural smell. The ingredients are in there for a reason so think of skincare as medicine for your face. If you have dry skin and want a gentle cleanse that still cleans you will love this product! Side Note: If it could work with my Clarisonic it would be even better but unfortunately it doesn't provide enough slip"
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,"I got this as a sample and tried to use it twice, but the smell is the worst!"
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,,My holy grail!,"It melts right away on your skin. Just a lil pump of the texture it will do all the cleansing which is quite impressive for me. I have combination skin but this product keep moisturising your skin/balancing ph level; even after wash because some of product I’ve been used, make my skin more dry. Much thank you evelom!"
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Smells like Tiger Balm,Terrible smell to this product! It smells like Tiger Balm Ointment! I almost thought I was cleaning my face with Tiget Balm! Will not be using this anymore .
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,"I’m not usually sensitive to scent, but I can’t handle this smell - clove? Something strong, and it didn’t even cleanse very well. Pass on this one."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Smelt like oily cigaret butts and dirt,I don't even know how this works. I used it once and followed with the rest of my skin care routine. nothing covered up the smell. I face smelt until I washed it in the morning. I would never recommend this stuff.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,oily,"I've never thrown away a sample after using it once, until now. The texture is odd, but no big deal. On first whiff, it smells of spice/cloves, then once I added water and start working into a lather, it had this nasty plastic/chemical smell. Horrible! Once I rinsed it off, my skin did not feel clean. It felt like there was a film on my skin. After reading the ingredients I found it was filled with different oils. I would not use again and I certainly would not pay $78 for this!!!! insane."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Not recommended based on smell and effectiveness,"Received this as a 5ml free sample and used it 3 times.  There's product left but I don't see the point.  The smell was the most objectionable part - it was sort of a like a very strong gin smell?  So, maybe juniper?  Not pleasant.  But, it also didn't clean well, doing a very poor job on my Hourglass mascara and requiring double cleansing with another product.  I can't imagine paying $60 for this."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,This stuff smells so bad and it was really hard to rinse off.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,the smell,the smell is unpleasant. i felt like i was putting some rotten gel on my face... it didnt cleanse my face either.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,So it smells like hops..... totally worth it!,This is the BEST! Yes it smells bad (hops and grapes) at least there isn’t added fragrances that irritate my sensitive skin. It took off my water-proof makeup while leaving me feeling moisturized yet not oily. Next day my skin was less red and still felt moisturized w/o any oil build up.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Not for Sensitive Eyes,"I am so glad I only tried this as a sample because I have never cried so much from a cleanser in my life. My eyes were tearing up on and off for 20 minutes even after I rinsed my face multiple times, used a different cleanser to take off the residue, and used anti-redness eye drops. I did not even open my eyes at any point of washing my face. Also beware of the scent - very strong eucalyptus and other bitter sharp herbs. I typically like for my skincare to smell natural and medicinal but this was just offensive and unpleasant. This sample went straight to the bin."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,"My skin isn't really sensitive to anything honestly but this made me all red and it smells terrible, I would pass on this"
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,"Got this as a free sample - loved it. Didn’t notice a smell??? Wish it foamed a bit more, but whatever. 4/5 because of the price."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Oh no.,What is up with the smell of this product?? Fragrance is not something I judge skincare by but it was absolutely revolting. In addition to the fact that it didn't remove my makeup at all warrants a one-star rating for this $60 product.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Amazed!!,I love this cleanser! The fragrance does not detract from the performance which is spectacular!!
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,"Terrible smell, Didn't clean my face","First impression, the smell is putrid. Secondly, the cleansing property is non existent. I had to use the product twice to even begin to get my mascara off ... and eventually resorted to grocery store cleanser to finish the job. I received a sample with plenty of product to reuse for several days, instead of saving it I placed it directly into the trash on night one. I can't imagine my disappointment if I had paid for this product."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Couldn’t get past the smell,"I received a generously-sized sample, enough for several uses. The product felt creamy and smoothe between my fingers, although it didn’t have great lather. As cleansers go, it did the job and my face seemed clean, but nothing my regular cleanser doesn’t already do. Unfortunately, the product has an almost-rubbery scent, which was so offputting that I wouldn’t consider purchasing the full-size."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,The smell was very overwhelming and I couldn’t really breathe. Other than it felt nice on the skin. But I wouldn’t use it again.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,"I’ve never been bothered by a product’s smell before...until now. I couldn’t get it off my face fast enough. As a cleanser it does a fine job, but no better than other lesser priced cleansers I’ve used from Sephora."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Horrific smell and contains VEGETABLE OIL,"Got this as a sample with my order. When I opened the 5ml sachet I noticed the smell right away. They say its clove -- I say it's disgusting. The texture of this product is also gross-- it's like a gooey gel that feels like oil. Reading the packaging it says its a ""hybrid gel to balm formula"" (okay makes sense) but then it goes on to say it has ""shea butter and grapeseed oil"" however, what they fail to mention is the next ingredient is VEGETABLE OIL. ""Moisturizes for 12 hours"" it says-- YEAH because you're putting a hydrogenated oil in your pores. I could not wash this off my face fast enough after I decided to read the ingredient panel mid-cleansing to find out what the fragrance was. I had to wash my face TWICE with my regular cleanser to get the residue off my skin AND I can still smell it 10 mins later writing this. Do not buy this if you have normal to dry skin thinking it's going to moisturize anything-- I know for a fact if I used this product daily for a week it would clog my pores and cause me to breakout-- and I'm 36!"
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,"Love the results, HATE the smell.","This balm did an amazing job removing my face makeup, my eyeliner and mascara (neither are waterproof but still hard to get off...) but as another reviewer said, the smell just makes me sick. I think it's the cloves. Luckily this is a sample and it's unfortunate because if it weren't for the scent I'd buy the full size, it worked that well, and the ingredients also seem to be really good from what I could distinguish. I'm going to try the Farmacy makeup melter stuff and hope that smells better."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Lesser Priced Options That Don't Smell Gross,Did what it was supposed to do but don't think it's any better than lesser priced balms....and the smell is so weird and unpleasant in the evening.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,yuck!!,yuck! smells like dirty feet and lingers. ive tried many balm cleansers and this left me feeling so oily and clogged that i had to exfoliate afterwards! not to mention use anothet oil makeup remover to get my mascara off (not even waterproof) stick to clinique take the day off. much more gentle.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Not worth the price.,For the price you would think that you would get at least a months worth of cleanser.  It hardly came to a foam. Maybe its good for other people but I would not waste $60 on this.
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Eve Lom Gel Balm Cleanser - 30ml,used to use the tub version but this is easier to use and just as effective at cleansing gently
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Adequate,"This did a fine job removing makeup. But good lord the smell. I can't even be indifferent about it. I usually use Sunday Riley and those smell too, but this cleanser must have hit a biological note with me or something. I couldn't hack it and had to return. Smell it in person first, I'm sure if you're okay with it that it will meet your needs."
EVE LOM-Gel Balm Cleanser,USA,Exactly what I've been looking for,This cleanser has become a staple in my shower and gym bag for the past month. I've tried other gel cleansers and they always make my skin feel like it sucked the moisture out of it. Gel Balm Cleanser leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. It's a great complement to original Cleanser.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Holy grail!,So glad I decided to buy this! This has improved the texture of my skin dramatically. I use this right before I use my tatcha rice wash (which also has improved my skin texture) a little goes a long way
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,Singapore,blue,"Niceeeee! may not given much thought to removing your makeup — that is, until you've experienced the transformative luxury of a buttery, melty cleansing balm. "
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,Singapore,Favourite cleansing balm ,"Love the scent of it, and it cleanses really well. Even tho it’s oily, i don’t feel that it clogs my pores. A little goes a long way so one tub lasts me for a really long time! Good addition to your basket during sales. "
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,Singapore,fresh hydrated face,"this felt so luxurious to use, especially when my skin was dry - exfoliated but also left it feeling hydrated. only star off is for the price point."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,love love ,Love it. Love using it every time on my skin. Can’t tell you guys how much it’s worth the money as for me personally it was pricy but it does the work done. But to repurchase it i would rethink unless there’s promo going on. But worth the try. 
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Game changer,"Ok, so I am legit blown away right now. I recently bought the Sunday Riley Blue Moon. I use it for my first cleanse to remove makeup and/or.  It is worth noting it is my first balm cleanser. Ok, so I am legit blown away right now. I used Blue Moon for my first cleanse to remove makeup.  It is worth noting it is my first balm cleanser. This took off my waterproof mascara in 2-5 seconds WITHOUT SCRUBBING! 

This balm feels so nourishing on my skin. It leaves it feeling soft and makeup/sunscreen residue free for my first cleanse. I follow it with another cleanse as it is a balm and more oily than my regular cleanse.  The smell is soothing and calming with Blue Tansy and German Chamomile (2 of my calming favorites oils) but also has the refreshing scents of Sweet Orange and Vanilla (other favorites of mine)."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Grainy texture,"I got this in an Ipsy haul, and the reviews here confirm the texture is supposed to be grainy. It’s not super noticeable at first because the first scoop I got was mostly smooth balm. But the next few times it was really annoying because the grainy things are not enough to be a complete exfoliator and the texture is just not what I expected when using a balm. It smells good, but it didn’t really remove makeup easily.... you’re better off using anything but this."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,One of my favs,This was my first face cleansing balm and my introduction to Sunday Riley. I bought it from ipsy in a skincare bundle. Since this one I've tried countless cleansing balms but this is one of my favs (along with farmacy green clean) I have dry sensitive skin and this works so well for my skin. It doesn't dry my skin out at all.. It leaves it hydrated after i use it.. It takes all my makeup off even waterproof makeup. The smell is amazing and I actually really like the texture. Yes this feels a bit like a exfoliater but the sugar crystals melt into your skin very quickly. I personally prefer chemical exfoliaters bcuz I find physical exfoliaters to be rather rough on my sensitive skin but this isn't like that imo. I also love that it doesn't leave a gross film all over my face after I use it like some other balms (sorry glow recipe papaya balm) I highly recommend this is you have dry sensitive skin.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Hate the texture,"This product smells great, but I bought it because it is advertised as a balm. However it is actually a gritty exfoliator. I'm pretty disappointed with that as if I wanted an exfoliator, I would've bought one. This feels rough on my skin and it's also hard to remove. I end up having to use a second cleanser to fully remove the leftover grit."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,great cleanser,This is a effective gentle cleanse.  Melts dirt and makeup off beautifully...does not leave a film...just clean skin.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,calming,Very calming I only use about the size of my pinky nail to cleanse. Takes off all makeup and smells amazing but subtle. Makes my routine feel luxurious.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,LOVE IT,"great cleansing balm!! it doesn’t leave a film and slightly exfoliates. smells good too and works well with sensitive, acne prone skin!!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,Luxurious Cleansing Balm,Love this! This is my first cleanser in my double cleansing routine and i adore the calming scent. Fits the name - Blue Moon Tranquility CB. It feels luxurious especially during the pandemic when i can't go to any spa to get any facials done. The balm is gentle enough yet cleans well removing all makeup residue. This plus a mild gentle cleanser ensures my skin is pimple free. A must try from Sunday Riley. 
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,Singapore,exfoliating cleanser,"The exfoliating cleanser really does help to remove the makeup. however as the beads is abit big, and I do not like to pull the skin around my eyes when removing makeup, so I still use a separate cleanser for removing eye makeup."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,"This would be fine without the physical ""scrub""","I don't know. This is kind of a nice cleansing balm on some ways. It definitely removes makeup and cleans pores, and something in it, probably the blue tansy, reduces redness, which is great. But as other reviewers have mentioned, it has this little exfoliating crystals in it that I just couldn't deal with. They're just unnecessary, and physical exfoliants are just a hard pass for me, as they irritate the skin and cause micro tears. I noticed the irritation building up over time as I used this. Plus, the little crystals get in your lashes. It's so odd to have them in a product meant for the eyes. If you let the balm sit in your skin for awhile, the crystals will dissolve from the heat of your skin, but there are so many cleansing balms out there that don't have annoying little crystals in them."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,"Excellent for my oily, insensitive skin!","I have oily, insensitive skin and I rarely wear makeup. I try to avoid using moisturizers because they typically break me out and leave my skin feeling heavy. Because of that, I try to use hydrating products in my routine whenever I can. I've been using this cleansing balm at night for the past 3 weeks and I love it. It moisturizes my face, leaves my skin feeling like silk (even the next day), and it doesn't break me out at all. It seems like this container will last me quite a while, as well. A little pricey but well worth it in my opinion. A wonderful first-step in my night time skincare routine!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,This product works good for face makeup but not eye makeup. Doesn’t remove it and leaves a film. I love the texture of it and is good for no makeup days or light makeup days.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Sensitive skin stay away,"Pain. That word more than describes this cleansing balm. I’ve used so many cleansing balms and I have never used one that physically exfoliants my skin. And if you’re holding on to the ounce of hope that it’s a fine exfoliant, it’s not. And that’s not even the worst thing—after I use it as a first cleanse, then cleanse with my second foaming cleanser, it still sticks to my eyes. As hard as I try to wash it out, it doesn’t budge and continues to irritate my eyes for the rest of the evening and all of the next day. Because of the price point, I’ve tried to make this work. But I think I’m left with no choice but to use it on my feet—not even worth giving to someone else."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,skin feels like SILK,"Purchased this to double cleanse with Ceramic Slip, but after using it was so in love with how my skin felt, I ended up using it solo.  For the amount of product it contains and how little you need to use - I can more than rationalize the price point.  Glad I tried this on a whim!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,Singapore,Recommended!,Pleasant smell and leaves a lovely after feeling.     Bought it along with the wash and so far so good. Just started to use and trust it will be great in the long run. 
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Works well but not my fav,"I love using a cleansing balm pre cleanser, especially if I've been wearing full makeup or after a long day to really deep clean. I do feel like this one cleans well but I much prefer the farmacy brand. Blue Moon has an almost gritty texture and I feel like I really need to rinse to get rid of the residue feeling and it stings my eyes. When I use the Farmacy Green Clean, I scrub it all over, it melts away make-up, and does not sting my eyes. I will continue to use the Blue Moon but I don't think I would purchase again as it's not my favourite. I do love the Sunday Riley brand though!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Blue Heaven,"This cleansing balm is HEAVENLY. Best balm I have EVER used. I was hesitant to order given the negative reviews, but so happy I did. I literally use the size of my pinky finger nail to cleanse my entire face. (I’m making this stretch for $50.) It spreads very easily and thinly. The little sugar granules melt with the heat or your hands I don’t find them abrasive at all on my Tretinoin sensitive skin. I also do a first cleanse with a less expensive oil and then second cleanse/mask with this balm, leaving it on for 20 minutes. My skin feels like a baby. New to Sunday Riley and her skincare is so elegant thus far having only tried this, Good Genes, and Juno."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Big Fan!,"My skin was so soft, well rested, and smooth the next morning! Felt great to apply and did a great job of cleaning. Loved the exfoliant in the balm."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,2 in 1 product!,"It’s a cleansing balm yes and it’s awesome, but it’s Lao a mask as well. Directions for mask are on the product. Apply to clean face let it sit for 20+ min and rinse off with warm water. You skin will feel so soft!!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,I really wanted this to be my new go to cleanser. But I just hate the little exfoliating beads. It seems like the wrong thing to put in a cleanser for make up removal. I don't like the beads in my eyes. Other than that the cleanser is ok.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Maybe we should stop seeing each other...,"I guess I don’t have time to add another thing to wash off while I’m trying to wash off. Removes makeup well, but transformed my face into an oil rig. I’d rather remove my makeup with a non-greasy, single-step alternative. Diorsnow White Reveal Gentle Purifying Foam or Estée Lauder Perfectly Clean have proven effective for non-drying single step makeup removal."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,Divine but pricey,"This smells so good, like a spa. Removes makeup and exfoliates skin at the same time, and leaves the skin feeling clean and soft but not tight. With this, my skin does not really require a second cleanse if I only wear light makeup. However, when I have my monthly breakouts the sugar granules can hurt my skin if I rub too hard. When I use it as a mask, my skin feels moisturised and looks slightly plumped up. I took off half a star because it's expensive."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,True Blue Love,"Gosh, for someone who has never liked cleansing balms/oils, I sure do love this product! I’m not a heavy makeup wearer by any means, but no matter how much I have on, this takes it all off beautifully. I have very sensitive skin and the small amount of grit in this doesn’t cause any irritation...the more you massage it the more the little sugar granules dissolve. The scent is light but delicious, and feels luxurious. My favorite thing about this though is how non slippery/oily it feels on my face. It’s a true balm texture and doesn’t turn to straight oil slick when applied. You can definitely work it in with your fingers which I love about it. 10/10 would highly recommend this product! Sunday Riley has another winner, and I’ll definitely be repurchasing."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Love this blue moon!,Love this! Takes off ALL of my make up. I apply to my dry face with dry hands. Then I get in the shower. Work product in with a little warm water. Makes my face feel clean and hydrated!
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,Too oily,This cleans well but was too oily for me. I had to wash my face twice as it felt really greasy. Had a slight break out after using this. The price was on a high side too. 
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,good oil based cleansing balm,This cleansing balm is quite luxurious to use and has gentle sugar based granules that help to exfoliate dry skin. I would recommend this product to anyone with dry skin for the moisturizing properties of the product. Also the price is high
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Great texture,I love Sunday Riley products and this cleanser is no exception.  Great texture...not too gritty....super soft finish.  My only issue is that it leave a bit of residue in the sink.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,great ,Great effective product. highly recommend. beautiful packaging. repeat customer. have recommended to family and friends who also love the product. will try the rest from brand. 
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,Didn’t like and I’m bummed!! Smell was weird. Did not like. Has a gritty texture which is so odd! I’m more of a Farmacy Green Clean girl I guess.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,strong enough feelings to review before finishing,"ok, a cleansing balm is used (most of the time) as a double cleanse right? you use a balm to melt away makeup and grime before you actually wash your face. I know some people like to use a balm and that's it, but this leaves such a thick residue that you cannot do that with this balm. my biggest issue is the grains of....sugar? wax? I'm not sure what it is but it's definitely a scrub type sensation. mind you, it's not a deep scrub but it's enough that I don't want to use my other face scrub/cleanser after. 
most of the use of a balm for me is to melt away mascara and eye makeup. I don't want a scrub around my eyes. in fact, I want to know who does?! 
okok. bypassing the fact that there is a scrub feeling to it, the particles get stuck in my eyelashes and don't wash out. I find myself trying to pick pieces out of my lashes. if I just leave them there(little white pieces) then they get in my eyes. that's not comfortable at all. it feels like having an eyelash in your eye but even harder to get out. 
the actual use of a balm to melt away makeup I would give a 4/5. it does well most of the time. 
I haven't used this up yet and I've never felt so strongly on a product that I went out of my way before finishing a product to review it, but I will be finishing it because this is so dang expensive. I'm about halfway through it. 
I bought this from another site with a couple other Sunday Riley products. 
I will be using it up. I will not repurchase. I do not recommend to any person. I don't understand the reviews tbh."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,Worked Well,"Product did its job and cleansed my makeup so effectively! But it left a film on my skin after rinsing it off. Had to use my cleanser after, but all in all still a good product!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,harsh on acne breakout,the beads is not sugar based. feels like synthetic beads. it hurts my acne flare up and I had to stop using this during acne purging.  so disappointed for the expensive price but no great result
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,SUPER GOOD ,"This is an amazing make up remover that helps to remove waterproof eyeliner and mascara! Also smells super good. There’s bits in it that also exfoliates the skin which i love. Even tho it’s a lil pricy, nothing good comes cheap so i’ll definitely repurchase!!! "
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,I cannot say enough good things about this product. I use it as a mask two or three times a week. It makes your skin soooooo soft. It is must for people with dry skin. It also smells amazing.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,"Smells good, love the granular bits which helps to exfoliate! ","I bought this during the annual GSS sale at 50% off. It was a great steal! My daily cleansing routine already consists of a facial wipe plus cleanser.  I only use this either once a week, or days when I am using my waterproof mascara that can use a bit more help to remove it off. Love the consistency, and the smell is nice without too overpowering. The little granular bits in the balm helps to exfoliate my skin too. Skin feels soft after I rinse it off. Will buy this again during the sale! "
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,What happened to Sunday Riley!?,"So disappointed!! I loved this balm, but something has changed. How can a company change their formula and say nothing to the consumer. This used to be a firm balm with very fine texture now it’s a soft scrub like texture resembling anything I can go pick up at the nearest drugstore. It barely turns into  the milky texture it used to. It used to go from balm to oil to milky, now it’s just a hash oily scrub! You even have to use way more for it to actually resemble a first step cleanse. Even the name on the packaging is now Clean rinse balm instead of tranquillity balm with no heads up. Sunday Riley is just getting shadier by the day, admitting to posting fake reviews on Sephora, now this. Don’t appreciate being duped out of my money with no explanation. I’m shutting the door on this brand, Sephora you are too good to carry it anymore"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Moisturizes and cleans beautifully,Moisturizes and cleans beautifully!  Gets off all makeup.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,multi purpose balm,"it is a multi purpose balm. it cleanses well and have a little granules as scrub. so dun not rub too hard while removing makeup. Although it doubles as a mask,  it is too expensive for that. "
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,Multitasking & Hydration,"My favourite cleansing balm ever.. i like to take with me when im traveling since its multi tasking as cleansing balm remove my face make up very well, exfoliate and essential oil that hydrates my skin. Then followed by my 2nd cleanser iSclinical."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Simply the Best,"I use several Sunday Riley products and this is by far my favorite. I have also never used a cleanser/mask that has made such a difference in my skin.  I am almost 50 with fair , nonsensitive skin that is dry during cold weather and basically normal with some oil on my T zone during the summer. I put a thin layer of this on my face about four times a week, leave it on for at least 20 minutes, then I use a Konjac sponge to scrub my face and rinse it of. This is the first product I have used that makes my face look dewy, plumped up, so soft and moisturized. It is as if it is working from the inside out. I would use it twice a day, every day if I could."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Gritty,Ew. Gritty and feels awful on and around the eye area. If this was called “exfoliating balm” I would have at least known what I was in for! There are so many cleansing balms - skip this for sure :(
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,Pleasantly surprised ,"This came as a surprise, the tub was relatively huge. I like the fact that its basically multi purpose-- works as a cleansing balm, a scrub, and a mask. Makes my skin softer and looking more radiant, and the smell is a huge plus!! Hopefully it goes on sale again, as the full price is a little too steep. "
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,Overpriced,"It’s a beautiful product aesthetically, and it cleans well and does its job. But at full price you can definitely get alternatives that are just as good, if not better, at a significantly lower price. "
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,Sunday Riley blue moon tranquility cleansing balm,Sunday Riley blue moon tranquility cleansing balm never disappoint. it is a big jar too. it smells.great and a little bit goes a long way. love Sunday Riley products.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Just Okay,"Overhyped. This product is just okay. I like using it during winter when my skin is extra dry. However, Im not a fan of the texture (weird waxy, grainy) and the price. I love Sunday Riley, but this isn’t their best product."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Clean AND moisturized skin!,"If you want a one step cleaning routine that removes make up, didn’t strip your skin, and gently exfoliates, go.buy.this.immediately. I have combination skin that leans more dry than oily. As a result I’ve tried every high to low end face wash on the market; used a clarifying then creamy face wash; used a one step make up remover / wash and followed w toner....and nothing has provided the one step, cleansing, moisturizing and pore unclogging results like Blue Moon Tranquility Cleaning Balm. (If you’re deciding between this and Farmacy Green Clean, this wins, hands down. Make up remained after initial Green Clean wash and I had to use extra toner to remove before applying other products). Price tag hurts but using at night helps stretch between repurchases."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Not for me,I really wanted to love this product. I use Diorshow mascara and Tranquility removes only if I scrubbed hard. Then I noticed how dry the area around my eyes became after using. Had to return.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,like sand in my eyes :(,"Works amazing to remove makeup. However, not a fan of the gritty scrub. I have been using a 2 step cleansing process for a couple years now. A cleansing balm to remove all my waterproof makeup then my foam cleanser and Clarisonic in the shower. Because I use this primarily for my eye makeup, I find that I get a lot of grits in my eyes. Thought I was splurging on this paying double the price, but I miss my IT cosmetics makeup melting balm :( I would love the product if they removed the grits"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,i feel like the grains are too abrasive ,"first of all i love the sturdy packaging. the smell is divine! it kinda hard to dissolve and i feel like because of that  the grains are too abrasive. if this have a version without it, i'd rather get that. cause sometimes i just want to remove my makeup and cleanse my skin. i dont like exfoliating daily."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,why isn’t this carried in store?!,"This is my second favorite Sunday Riley product (only after Good Genes). This cleanser is amazing for  removing the day’s grime and makeup from my face without showering. Gone are the useless face wipes or cotton pads to try to remove makeup and dirt or dousing your face at the sink only to get water everywhere....I hate when it drips down to my elbows while I am trying to wash my face! I have tried other cleansing balms and none compare to this one. I simply massage a small amount onto my dry face and use a warm wet washcloth to wipe it and the mess away. My face feels clean and refreshed. Not dried out, nor oily. Perfect for my night time beauty rituals."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,WOW,Love this product! Quite surprised how this cleansing balm removes make-up and smoothens my face at the same time! Pricey but definitely worth it! Will re-purchase again!
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,Wanted to love it,I really wanted to love this because I really enjoyed some other Sunday Riley products. But unfortunately this broke me out every time I used it. Has granules in it so it also exfoliates the skin. Isn't worth the price
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,"Insanely expensive, but worth every penny. My skin is *extremely* sensitive (facial eczema, two rounds of accutane, you name it) and this cleansing balm is wonderful. Removes all of my makeup, smells amazing, and leaves my skin silky smooth. A must buy!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,"This product is not greasy like other cleansing balms I tried.  It has some grittiness to it which really gets the pores clean.  Rinses off easily and does a good job of removing makeup.  It doesn't take a lot of product, so the value isn't bad."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Night Time Must Have,I love Blue Moon. I have tried all the other cleansing balms and they either dried me out or didn’t clean away my make up. Even though the price is steep a little goes a long way. The fact it makes a great mask improves its value.It cleans very well and leaves my skin soft. I love the scent which I cannot say about many products because I am super sensitive to perfumes and fragrances.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Loving Blue Moon!,"I can’t even say how much I enjoy this product, it has really been a game changer for me. The entire experience is elevating, it feels so luxurious. The balm is silky to the touch, and when you rub it in, it has this super gentle dissolving sugar exfoliant. You can barely feel them, I NEVER use physical exfoliants, but I am sold on this product! The balm lightly buffs anything you may have sitting on your skin. It removes residue well, and leaves your skin feeling beyond amazing. Super hydrated & plump. And it dissolves immediately, once in contact with water. I was really impressed with Blue Moon, as I am with Sunday Riley’s entire line! They really tend to work well on my oily-combo early 30s skin."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,"Sunday Riley, where have you been all my life?","I LOVE this cleansing balm!!! I received a sample Vitamin C Sunday Riley moisturizer and couldn't wait to try more of the line.  Many of their products are now my MUST-HAVES and this one is at the top of the list.  I wear full coverage make-up most days and this miracle worker removes all of my makeup leaving my skin clean and fresh.  No irritation whatsoever!  I have acne-prone, combination skin and I have seen a definite improvement since I began using Sunday Riley.  My pores are greatly diminshed.  I cannot be without this cleansing balm!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Different Batch on Second Purchase,The first time I got this it was great and I loved it.  My face felt so clean after using and it didn't leave any residue.  I purchased again (both times from Sephora) and it is very different.  It is much more soupy and wet then the first time and it leaves a residue when rinsing off.  I am disappointed in the inconsistency and I specifically switched to this product because it was a cleansing balm that didn't leave a residue after rinsing.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Abrasive!! Not for dry or sensitive skin,"This is my first review, and its for all the sensitive skin ladies out there. This is not for you!! I thought “balm” implied gentle, but I found it to be very abrasive. It made my already dry and irritated skin very angry. I loved the product itself, it just doesn’t work for my sensitive skin. It smells nice and felt clean but after several uses my skin is super red, irritated, and dry."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,effective for sensitive skin,great for sensitive skin that doesn't tolerate cleansing with water. mild exfoliation which melts into skin and isn't too aggressive
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,A-MUST A+ product ,"Yes it’s pricey, but worth every single penny spent. If you are one of those people who uses different types of products - switches cleaner and etc then this one should be on your list. I use it at night as a cleaner and face looks tight and fresh. Worth it!! "
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,,Surprisingly Amazing,"Have always been a fan of double cleansing. Bought this with scepticism that it might leave a veil and be too heavy. But in the end, I was left surprisingly satisfied from the very first wash! "
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,I tried not to love you...,"Two years ago I picked up this product in the UK at a Space NK. I nearly had a heart attack from the price, but I was in desperate need of an exfoliating cleanser and this came highly recommended. So I dropped the ££ on this product and quickly fell in love. I felt like my pores were cleared and my skin was still dewy and moisturizer after I took it off with a muslin cloth. But upon returning to the US I couldn’t stomach the price and bought Farmacy’s Brand New Day exfoliating grains. I really liked it and have been using them for the past year. But now I’m out of the Farmacy and my mind keeps coming back to this stupid $50 cleansing balm. I shouldn’t and I won’t, but I know I’m going to cave and buy this wonderful balm and put it back into my routine. Lord save me. But this product really deserves its reviews, especially if you’re a daily makeup wearer (which I am not)."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Expensive for the amount you get...,"I do love this balm, but you’ll easily go through this within a month. I’ve bought it several times and a few on those times, the consistency was not a balm but a oily mess. Kind of like something you would get at the bottom of an oil scrub. Wasn’t hit in my house either. I should have returned it. I took 2 stars off for high price and consistently of the actual product."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,"Ok so I’m kind of obsessed with this product. I originally had considered purchasing the May Lindstrom Blue Cocoon Face Balm but couldn’t bring myself to pay $180. After doing some research online I came across this product. As I’ve gotten older my skin is much more sensitive to the temperature changes and I tend to get more redness and dryness during the winter. I also use Retin-A which adds to the dryness and irritation. After just a few nights of using this cleaning balm, my skin has improved significantly. There is less redness and dryness, and my skin feels so incredibly soft and smooth. So far I’ve only been using it at night and in the morning I use Darphin’s Intral Cleansing Milk. I especially love using this at night as it’s great to prep  the skin before applying Retin-A. Some people have complained about the sugar crystals but I really don’t mind them. They provide additional exfoliation which I appreciate. Not only is this product so pretty to look at, it truly is very effective. Strongly recommend you try it!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Shockingly Good!!,"I am actually shocked at how good this is. Sunday Riley products have always worked well for my acne prone skin so I thought I'd splurge on this. And it is SO GOOD. It is a very soft balm and has pillowy exfoliation beads. It gets all the make-up off and doesn't hurt my eyes or make them blurry after. AND it is actually clearing up my skin a little bit more (used in conjunction with mostly Sunday Riley skincare) . I thought this would be a one time splurge, but it is actually going to be a ride or die."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Great for sensitive or acne prone skin,"I absolutely love this cleanser! I am on my second jar of it and there is no going back! My skin is both sensitive and I get hormonal acne. Since using this cleansing balm regularly, my breakouts have calmed down and the sensitive areas on my face are no longer red and blotchy!!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,"I was using the IT cleansing balm and it was fine, but when I went to reorder I compared with this one and this one has much fewer and purer ingredients. The IT cleanser has a gagillion unpronounceable ingredients and this one seems much healthier. It exfoliates and will leave your skin feeling so soft and hydrated. Worth the hefty price."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,There are better alternatives,"With a good amount of product this cleansing balm will remove the majority of make up.  However, it then leaves behind a greasy residue that is not easily removed.  If less product is used there is always left over makeup specifically in the eye area.  I purchased this as a cruelty free replacement to my Clinique cleansing balm, which I thought worked incredibly well.  I also had an issue with the smell, though that may not be a problem for others."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,great for sensitive skin,"I love , love , love this cleanser! I have hyper-sensitive, acne-prone skin and this not only cleans my face and removes makeup but it doesn't irritate it at ALL. I am a dedicated fan for life. This was my 'gateway' into Sunday Riley skin care and now use multiple products in the line. I have never EVER gotten compliments on my skin until I started using these products. I highly recommend if you're looking for a good cleanser (that works!) that doesn't irritate."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Pricy Jar of Product,"I can't justify the cost of this product.  If you wear a full faced of makeup, it doesn't effectively remove everything unless you use like...1/5 of the jar for each use.  There are better cleansing balms out there.  Some people suggest to use it as a mask, but then it still doesn't perform its intended purpose. Will not be repurchasing."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,NOTHING “TRANQUIL” ABOUT IT,"First of all, if you have sensitive skin, don’t waste your money.  This is not for “stressed” skin as it claims in the box.  This is just a sugar scrub.  Why you would recommend someone use this around their eyes is beyond me!  I don’t have sensitive skin at all and this was too abrasive for me.  And to boot, they have included a nice array of citrus essential oils that do absolutely nothing for your skin except maybe cause some contact dermatitis!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,my heart is broken,"Dude. I went through my first jar of this and I swear it solved all of my remaining skin problems. My skin was glowing. I ordered my second one and it’s totally different. First of all the jar now says “ clean rinse cleansing balm” instead of tranquility cleansing balm. Which makes me think they changed something. So the second jar is all melty and weird, and the exfoliant beads are huge. So much so that it was over exfoliating and cause me to breakout and have dry skin. I am so depressed because this was seriously my favorite. PLEASE FIX IT"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,"This is hands down my favorite product by Sunday Riley that I have tried so far. Currently, I use Luna oil, good genes, CEO, and Juno. Love all of them, but this makes my skin Feeling soft and cleansed. The sugar melts into your skin and you get a nice exfoliation from it. Not too harsh at all. Smells very relaxing. Doesn’t leave me feeling oily. Very happy with my purchase"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Underrated Overachiever,"I want the world to know about this, perhaps my favorite Sunday Riley product.  It’s tied with my GG, anyway.  I remove my makeup with a micelles water before using this goodness so it alllllll sinks in.  I leave it on my face for as long as I can before rinsing it off.  I have even taken a nap in it a handful of times when my skin has been kinda funky.  It helps so much with my blackheads/comedones while also being so hydrating.  So hydrating.  I am obsessed with blue tansy as a skincare product and a scent, so because of that it doesn’t hurt that I’m in love with this product.
As a fan of blue tansy, I once purchased a much, much more expensive product to test it out (they don’t sell it at Sephora), and I found that this product outperformed it by far and I sent it back.  I am on my third jar and will continue to reorder for pretty much eternity.  If you’re on the fence, do. It.  IMO, it’s the most underrated of all of the SR line."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,Smells very nice and does a great job at removing my makeup.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Money Better Spent Elsewhere,"Wow. So, I know that the scent of Sunday Riley products is the subject of much contention within their fanbase, but this is the first that has truly annoyed me. (For the record, I find Good Genes & UFO tolerable, bordering on pleasant, so it’s entirely possible I’m just a freak.) This stuff smells EXACTLY like those “chocolate covered orange” confections that are popular during the holidays. Not exactly luxurious, to say the least. 

That said, it performs well as a step one cleanser - something to remove the makeup & grime of the day, but you’ll definitely want to follow it with a more traditional lathering cleanser unless your skin is extraordinarily sensitive. 

Do you want to spend $50 on a makeup remover? Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE Sunday Riley! But for what it is, I’d rather drop half the cash on literally any other oil-based cleanser and focus my time & money where it counts: serums, oils, & moisturizers."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Worth the Splurge!,"If I could give this a rating of 12/10, I most certainly would. I love this cleanser. I love to use it as a mask, too. It's so soothing and calming on my dry, sensitive skin, and it smells divine. 
I used to purchase this in store, but then it became an online only item. When it moved, I tried a bunch of different options that were available in store, but none of them compared. This removes the most stubborn waterproof mascara, and dissolves every trace of full-coverage, long-wear foundation.
It is on the pricey side, but it is definitely worth it, and I find that a jar lasts me a good long while, as I usually use a nickel-sized amount for cleansing, or a quarter-sized if I am using it as a mask."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,This product is the balm!,"I was new to cleansing balms, but this has made me a believer.  I may never go back to foaming cleansers.  This balm feels great, practically melting in your hands and on your face.  It does a great job of removing makeup, and feels wonderful on the skin.  After using a cloth to wipe off, and rinsing, my skin feels fresh and moisturized but not overly moisturized. This was my gateway SR product, and it does so well, I’ve moved on to trying the Luna oil and Tidal cream.  I’m happy with all of them!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,A MUST HAVE!!,"This product leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft, and smooth. I use it to remove my make it -- and a little goes a long way! This product is amazing!!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Game changer!,"This is hands down one of my favorite cleansers! Use it to take makeup off, as a cleanser on its own, or as a mask! It works great all three ways! Leaves you with hydrated even skin!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Spa Grade - Worth the price,"Life changing -- I have combination, sensitive, and occasionally eczema-affected skin and up to this point my regimen has consisted of La Mer moisturizers, masks, toners and boscia cleansers, as they are the most delicate, moisturizing and effective for my skin. I get so excited to try new product lines, hoping for success (ie: no breakouts, and to find something at a lower price point than la mer) but I'm always left disappointed or with reactive skin, unable to convert..... however, this product truly blew me away. 

First, the consistency is a luxurious sugar based solid balm that just absolutely melts onto your skin into a super moisturizing milky layer. It really seems to pull away all the dirt, makeup, days buildup in the most gentle way. Second, there is *no* sneaky scent or fragrance. This is huge for me. Third, this balm can double as a leave-on hydration mask. Amazing !?! After rinsing, I was left with skin that literally felt like I'd just gone to the spa. And *then* I applied my night moisturizer.... oo la la ! 

If there was one draw back, I'd say the packaging is a bit large. It just barely fits inside my bathroom mirror cabinet. But clearly the product is worthwhile. I actually feel like it is comparable to a La Mer-grade product, so I plan to work it into my night time regimen as both a cleanser and a mask, and will continue to use boscia's gentle green tea oil cleanser to refresh in the morning. Unfortunately Sunday Riley's moisturizers/serums didn't work for me (breakout/fragrance), so I will continue to moisturize with La Mer, but in terms of cleansers/masks I Love the Blue Moon Balm ! Go for it."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,So sad :(,"I love Sunday Riley, and I love cleansing balms, so I had high hopes for this product! Unfortunately, it seems to clog my pores. My skin is generally really tolerant, and I don't usually have any problems with skin care products, so I was suprised and continued using it / experimenting with it, but no matter what I do, I get a handful of small zits after using it. I have combination/normal skin, depending on the season. 

Beyond that issue, here's what I think-- 
-I like the way it smells, and the consistency of the balm. It's sort of hard, and is a little grainy when you first start massaging it in, but in a good, soft, gently exfoliating way. It turns smooth after it heats up. 
-It doesn't rinse as cleanly as others I've tried, so double cleansing is a must (to me, anyway). 
-It leaves my skin really smooth and moisturized feeling. 
-I don't feel like it cleans very deeply, I think maybe because it's thick, it doesn't really feel like it's getting into my pores. 
-Until a blemish inevitably develops over the next 12 hours, my skin seems happy and calm.
-I think it is probably better suited for dry /dehydrated skin. ---My sister really loves it... I ended up giving it to her because I kept it too long to return."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,"Perfect for dry, sensitive skin",I have sensitive cheek skin and rosacia but my cheeks are also very dry so I find it hard to find a cleanser that is good enough to take off makeup but not irritate my skin and dry it out more. This is the perfect cleanser for me! It takes off my makeup and is so soothing and moisturizing and has actually improved my skin where it is not dry and my makeup goes on better. Highly recommend and a little goes a long way so this should last you a while.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Great buy greasy.,"PROS: Great consistency, loved the slight exfoliation with the little granules, does a great job at removing makeup, and it has a gorgeous baby blue color.

CONS: haaaaaaaaated the oil feeling after washing it out. I double cleanse anyway and my cleanser removed that feeling, but ugh."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Perfect for Sensitive Skin,"I absolutely love this cleansing balm, it is now a staple in my skincare regimen! I have combination-oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin and I also struggle with redness due to rosacea. This cleansing balm is so easy to use and extremely soothing. It does a fantastic job removing my makeup at the end of the day and leaving my skin feeling clean, soft, and refreshed. I've also noticed an improvement in my skin tone and clarity since I started using this product about a week ago. Furthermore, this product has not caused any breakouts and in fact has helped my skin to stay balanced. I would highly recommend this product!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,Works great I love all Sunday Riley products.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Get Ready for Beautiful Skin,"This product cleanses the skin without stripping it of its natural oils, leaving your face smooth, soft, and supple.  All without causing irritation, redness, or breakout. I love that this brand does not use filler products, instead focusing on using solely ingredients beneficial for your skin."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,Perfect after wearing makeup all day. It has small grains so it exfoliates. I like to leave it on a few minutes since it moisturizes.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Divine!,"WOW!!! Such a wonderful cleansing product, may be used as a mask, gently exfoliating, leaves my skin soft and smooth. My skin feels so good, I don’t even want to put any moisturizer afterward. Great product."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,If you never thought you needed a cleansing balm..,This is my first experience with a cleansing balm and I don't think I will ever go back to not using one! The reviews are correct in saying that is totally melts your makeup to be easily wiped away with a warm cloth. The skinceuticals cleanser I follow up with is now working so much more effectively. My skin is actually able to get a good deep cleanse with all the makeup thoroughly removed. Haven't tried any other brands but I don't see any reason to switch since blue moon is working great.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Average,I would say this product is “ok”. It’s a little too granular to use twice a day and on the yes for make up removal.  I did not notice reduction of redness but no large scale breakouts so just average.
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,SUNDAY RILEY Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,"this stuff is devine! a little goes a long way, your skin will feel amazing."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Disappointed,"The pros: My skin felt soft after rinsing. 
The cons: it doesn't liquefy into a silky smooth oil like I expect in a cleansing balm. it felt like it didn't rinse off completely. It stays think almost like petroleum jelly. The scrubbies in it are abrasive, not smoothing..feels like tiny shards of plastic or something sharp-ish.
I love other Sunday Riley products (Good Genes, Tidal, Luna)...this is the first one I have not liked."
SUNDAY RILEY-Blue Moon Tranquility Cleansing Balm,USA,Blue moon all day everyday!!,This balm is the bomb! Everything about this magical soothing hydrating cleanser is amazing! It gets my makeup off when I have any on and it hydrates my dry winter skin so well! The smell is amazing and it is the perfect tranquility inducing step that starts my bedtime skincare routine.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,"Great product, great cleaning",I got this for the first time in a sample box and I loved so much that I keep buying it now everytime I run out. My face feels really good after washing my face. I use it mostly before going to bed and I love the scent that leaves in my face.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Cleanser,"This cleanser is for all skin types & doesn’t foam excessively so should be suitable for those on the sensitive side. It’s full of natural, certified organic ingredients which add to the effectiveness"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Hubby loved this face wash,"I got the 6oz. bottle for my hubbs to try out. He loved it so much, when he ran out, he asked me to get him some more!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,disappointed in product and brand,Meh!! Save your money. I need to stop buying stuff off here. These reviews sucker you in. So disappointed in the product and brand.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Simply amazing!,"Simply amazing. I used to use all those gentle cleansers people rave about, but this is absolutely different level. It’s gentle, but cleanses very nicely, so there are no traces of the makeup removing oil. It doesn’t dry your skin, but still perfectly does it’s job."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,Great product. Really feel like it gets all the dirt off your face at the end of the day. Leaves your face feeling smooth and refreshed.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,This product turned my boyfriend into a believer,"I’ve been trying to get my boyfriend to properly care for his skin since forever but he was a strict, “the bar of soap that washes my body washes my face” kind of guy... well no more!

I bought him this cleanser and the face moisturizer as a gift and he absolutely fell in love with it and uses them both daily.  He works landscaping and construction so this really helps get in his pores and facial hair and removes all the excess sweat dead skin and grime from work and smells incredible.  He tried to pretend he didn’t love it as much as he does until it started to run out and asked for more.

The smell is great and it works incredibly we even fight over it while on vacation!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Husband added to his daily routine,"My husband is one of those easy care guys. He does the basic: soap, shampoo, deodorant.
Then because is shaves his head (no hair left), I encouraged him to add sunscreen everyday in the morning, on face, neck and head. He  has very light skin. When I bought this cleanser for him, I didn't think he would go for it, but as he started using it, he never went back. Now this. little lives in the shower and it has been replaced over and over again for new ones once it runs out. The smell is light and not noticeable much on the skin. I recommend it!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Female Jack Black Fan!,Love! My boyfriend used this and now I’m obsessed with Jack black products. If I didn’t wear make up this is the cleanser I use. It feels gentle yet still cleansing enough your face feels clean after. RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE. ❤️
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Decent plain/clean face wash for most skin types,"My husband and I both use this as a morning facewash in the shower. We are both prone to different types of acne. He has oily skin and really likes it. I have combo skin prone to dryness, I found it a bit too drying when I wash thoroughly with it. So I started using a half pump and gently washing for 30-60 sec, does the job nicely and the scent is mild and pleasant. already bought a second bottle!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"i purchased this for my eczema prone skin and found it to be a bit drying so my husband uses it daily on his face and head (he's a fella with no hair lol) and feels clean and refreshed after use! when i use it, i definitely feel less oily and that my skin is free of any dirt or grime"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,Great for sensitive skin,"I love this stuff. I’ve tried countless products after having a facial which caused dermatitis on my face which then it started to scar, my skin has always been super sensitive and I never had acne before that facial. This is gentle enough to clean everything off my face and it’s soft, it’s really helped breakouts and formation of blackheads around my face. 
I have no problem with the smell, it’s fairly light. 
The face buff is amazing paired with this, especially in the morning. Not only for guys, that’s forsure."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,"Okay, but nothing special. Not worth $35","First time purchaser of this, I used it for a week and its just a basic face wash. I don't feel anything special about this deserves a $35 price point but its a big bottle and a little goes a long way so I'll continue to use it. Not sure if I'll buy it again. I've never had major breakouts so I cant attest to how this works for break outs. For exfoliants I use a basic st. ives scrub. I think the combo of these two work well for now. Doesn't have a potent scent which I do like."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,Absolutely love this cleanser. Both the boyfriend and I use this day and night. Smells good and it lasts long because a little goes a long way.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,The top/cap does not close so the product leaks. End up having to turn upside down so it does not leak out.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"It's a gentle daily cleanser that works well, but the smell is a bit off putting."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,My husband uses this product every day and has been loving how moisturizer me his skin feels.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Husband approved,My husband likes this product. His face does look more clear.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Love,I have been using this after the butter cleanser from Drunk Elephant along with The Oridnary Niacinamide and Zinc serum for about 4 months now and my skin has never been better! Ever since I hit my 30's I have been getting cystic acne on my chin and for almost 2 months now I have had zero cystic breakouts! I did recently change from the butter cleanser to The Ordinary's squalane cleanser for a makeup remover but I will never ever stop buying this!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Great for sensitive skin (and not just for men!),"Both me and my husband use this everyday. I have super sensitive skin, and most cleansers are too harsh for me. This removes all my make up and leaves my skin feeling fresh without any stinging or redness. A little goes a long way and so a bottle lasts for ages."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"I've used this when I'm in a pinch and don't have my regular face wash. It doesn't feel drying or like it's stripping your face of everything. My husband loves this stuff and is on his 4th bottle. No break outs or redness with use. Fair warning though, neither of us break out with niacinamide, however if you are sensitive, do not purchase. Niacinamide does to work for everyone. Some do break out from it."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,Holy grail!,"My husband loves this and he has been washing his face with a bar soap all this while. I cringed and died a little inside when I found out so I bought him this out of a whim and he's on his second bottle now. Great ingredient list, nourishing and non-drying. My husband has normal skin and not sensitive."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"Bought this for my fiancé, he absolutely loves it. Have since purchased other items from the product range and he swears by them. They smell good too."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,My brother always ask me to restock this for him whenever there's a VIB Rouge sale. He swears this is the best cleanser he has used which helped with his acne and clearer skin. He no longer have breakouts since using this. He noticed a difference within weeks and have been using this day and night for 2 years now.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Breakout,"As other users have mentioned, it worked for few weeks and caused me an extreme breakout due to over drying. But I think it works good as a cleanser if you keep up with moisturizer and other skin care products."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,amazing for both men and women!,"This is amazing. I’m sad jack blacks products are more geared towards men because they’re amazing. I got a whole set of products for my man, including this cleanser and I have to say, it’s incredible. This is better than any cleaner I own! I just started using it one off day and it keeps my nice and clear! I love it! We will both be using this cleanser from now on."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Best Ever,Got this as a sample and had to buy the 16oz. This is now my ultimate cleanser. Use it as a morning cleanse and as a second cleanse after my oil cleanser in the evening. Definitely does the job and keeps my acne prone skin calm!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,strong yet gentle and feels so good,"Initially I wasn't so sure about shelling out $40 for a cleanser but the amount of product you get will probably last all year if you're only cleansing your face twice a day. I only use half a pump as well, not to be conservative but a full pump is too much for my face. I love the good ingredients in this product plus being free of sulfates, parabens, unnecessary fragrances, dyes, etc. The cleanser isn't super foamy or stripping but has a nice creamy/milky consistency when a bit of water is added and is massaged onto the face. In the morning my face feels clean and ready for the day after washing with this and applying the Jack Black Double Duty spf 20 moisturizer (which also works well for me underneath my makeup). In the evening after using a makeup wipe this cleanser gently cleans off my remaining makeup and my skin doesn't feel like it's stripped of oils and dried out. The smell isn't bad either, fairly herbal due to the ingredients (looking at you sage and rosemaries) but not overwhelming and I enjoy it. I always look forward to washing my face with this product. All in all I will continue to use this product because of the amount you get for the price plus the way it performs, and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to try a new cleanser. Oh my only beef with it is the pump head popped off when I recieved it but it still works so it wasn't a big deal. I would have been choked if the pump was totally broken though, maybe they could up their game in how they ship this product so the pump doesn't break via shipping."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Staple,"I bought my bf this cleanser, their moisturizer and scrub for xmas once and he has consistently repurchased all three products. Jack Black is a great brand. He has sensitive fair skin (a natural blonde) and has had no issues with most of their products."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"I bought this product for my husband when he was having some sporadic breakouts. After a few uses, his face cleared up nicely."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,"Best cleanser, no matter your gender!","I went into sephora to talk to someone about getting a cleanser that worked to remove the light daily makeup I wear for work. I was told that there weren't any cleansers did the job perfectly, I'd just have to accept a double cleanse routine of some sort. Well lady you were WRONG!!! I got a sample of this cleanser and two others to try out, gave this one a go when I got home and there was nothing left on my skin when I went in afterwards with a micellar water. No mascara, no mineral foundation. Wasn't super foamy and didn't leave my skin feeling really stripped afterwards which was nice (wasn't exactly hydrating but better than a lot of foaming cleansers I've tried). I'd guess this wouldn't take off everything if you wear lots of makeup, but this absolutely exceeded my expectations."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Love,LOVE this product and I stand by it! Will never use any other cleanser! Didn’t even make me break out or have an allergic reaction like most cleansers do. Love the fresh smell and how clean my face feels afterwards.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,My husband loves this product particularly in the winter when his skin is drier. My only complaint is that this is the second Jack Black product sent mail order that has had a broken or missing part to the pump.  Would highly recommend that they package the pump separately in a box separate from the product with a lid on the bottle that can be replaced with the pump upon delivery.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,this stuff is terrible,"so I've been using this stuff for a few weeks now, I can't stand the smell, it's terrible and smells like floor cleaner.  I am not convinced that it's helping clean my face. Very disappointing considering how expensive it is and now I don't know what do with it."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. He was breaking out a bit just from not washing his face, but ever since he started using this, his face is clear! I also use it when I'm at his place. It's not drying and doesn't leave your face feeling tight, but also doesn't make it feel oily. Perfect balance!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Great face wash,"My husband loves this face wash! When I ran out of my other face wash, I started using it too! No residue or dry feeling left on skin. I’d definitely recommend this."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Good but smell eh,Bought for my boyfriend. He likes it except for the smell. Also he managed to break off the seal on the inside so now has to lean it upside down so it doesn't leak out!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,"Not drying, but would still recommend moisturizing","Doesn't FEEL like it cleans very well, however when I layered different kinds of makeup onto my hand (primer, color correct, concealer, lip liner, and lipstick) it took it all off with mild rubbing. After four days of use it hasn't really dried my skin out, however it doesn't leave it feeling very moisturized either. Has a slight menthol smell."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,This is the only cleanser my husband uses! I was buying the small bottle all the time. I am happy it comes in a bigger size now!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Best Cleanser of All Time!!!,I have oily skin along with severe acne and post acne marks and have been using this cleanser for 3 months. Im not exaggerating when I say this product has helped my skin tremendously! my skin texture improved so much that people where asking what products I have been using. I haven't had a major break out since using this besides the occasional pimple. Trust me you will not regret buying this cleanser.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Effective but drying,"Bought this for my fiancee, and he found it effective for acne and redness, but that it was very drying. If you moisturize, this would probably be a 4-star review."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"I bought this for my boyfriend last year and he uses it daily and has great skin. It lasts a super long time too I only just now had to buy another one. I got the larger size. I really like that this product doesn't use parabens, phthalates or sulfates too."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,A great face cleanser.,"I was on the hunt for a great face cleanser for my husband, prior to this he switched from Clinique to Lab Series and he just wasn't a fan, therefore he wasn't really using the product. So after much research and reading countless rave reviews on this product, I was so relieved and impressed when I got him to switch and he also really enjoys using this cleanser. So much so that I got curious and tried it myself. It's a great, simple cleanser that does the job. I can see why my husband likes it. He's struggled with sensitive skin and breaks out of any excess oil on this skin, but then using some of the products either dried out his skin and stripped off any moisture from his face, I mean, the struggle was real. So this product along with it's moisturizer, have become his holy grail of facial routine. Simple, to the point and gets the job done."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,"Bought 4 boyfriend, now use for myself",I bought this and the jack black exfoliating for my boyfriend and he LOVES it! We ended up buying a huge bottle and I’ve been using it too. It has a refreshing scent and provides a deep clean without stripping my skin.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,I buy this cleanser for my preteen boys.  The smell is great and not overpowering.  Keeps their faces clean and breakout free.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Dries out,"I bought the pump version of this in-store and after reading all these glowing reviews online, I decided to buy it (I'm female, by the way). However, this is more for oily skin, and mine is very much combination skin. I only use this 2-3 times a week when I'm having an oily day, because otherwise, it dries out my skin. Wish the product description said what skin type this best suited. Additionally, my skin doesn't look any fresher/smoother than before."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Good,Got this as a gift! Seems like the recipient likes it!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Good cleanser,"My husband really likes it, he has pretty normal skin and this cleans well without making his skin dry. I tried it and it's a little drying for my skin (female, sensitive combo skin)."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"This cleanser replaced my old clean and clear cleanser that i have been using for years. I started using the glycolic first but didnt want to use it everyday and switched over to this one. It doesnt irritate my skin , it has a light scent but not to overpowering. I use it twice a day and the 6 oz bottle has lasted me for a couple of months and it is still halfway. A little bit goes a long way with both products. These cleansers are more expensive than what i was use to but theyre worth it."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Oil has to overcompensate for dryness,Purchased for my hubby that has combination skin. Also is prone to break out from the gel in his hair. This worked great in the beginning but after a couple weeks it started to dry out his face way too much. He also mentioned its really dry after washing but after a few hours his skin is so oily trying to fix the dry problem.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Not just for men’s skin!,"I had samples of these that I got for my boyfriend, but since I ran out of the face wash I used, I decided to try this out. It’s amazing! It left my face so clean- but not that strange, squeaky clean; just fresh. And my skin was so clear after. I don’t have acne-prone skin, but I do get the occasion breakout  that leaves a dark spot. This stuff evened my skin tone and all but eliminated my breakouts. 
I’m planning on buying this for myself. Definitely worth the money!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,I got this for my fiancé and I actually started using it myself. It doesn't irritate and it cleans out your pores well
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,I bought this for my boyfriend to help with his minor acne and it works awesome!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Good cleanser for a good price,"This is a good, basic cleanser if that's the only thing you're looking for. Its primary purpose is to clean the skin and this gets the job done."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,My boyfriend likes it,My BF has tried a lot of products to help with acne and combination skin. It has been a huge pain in the butt for him. This products seems to help with these issues better than anything else he has tried.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"My boyfriend has always used bar soap and exfoliants on his face daily. I talked him into going to Sephora with me to look for a cleanser for him. The lady working there recommended this facial wash and the Face Buff to use a few times a week. He bought the cleanser and she gave him a sample of the Face Buff because he was not wanting to buy both and spend that much (such a guy!). He started using the cleanser right away and thought it was so so, This week he started to occasionally use the Face Buff sample and he loves the combination together and is ready to buy it."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Wow.,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 years, up until now, I have not seen his skin look better. He says he loves the texture and how clean, smooth, and gentle his face feels afterwards. He will be repurchasing.

I'd also like to add that I love the fact that it's a natural product."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Refreshing!!,"One of the best cleanser I have used. My skin is naturally very oily, but after a few days the chemical have been more balance and I don't get too oily that much. It has a minty feel after using it. My skin isn't overly dry after uses. and it's smooth. Works well for me. Thank you."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,AMAZING,I have used so so so many face cleaners this is by FAR the best ever. The feeling is unreal your skin feels CLEAN but not dry at all. This is a must try you will fall in love.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,My husband loves it!,"My husband works outdoors mostly and on project sites (he is in city-outdoor plumbing). Therefore his skin deals with the unfortunate weather, sun, dirt, etc exposure. He loves this cleanser and says it makes his face feel clean after a day on the project site. He also says his skin has been much smoother and he just really enjoys it. Nice to see he can enjoy being pampered!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Love it!,This face wash really helps both my husbands and my face.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,BF Loves,My boyfriend loves this. Got him the big bottle. Says his face felt like it was kissed by the ocean. Leaves his skin clean and not dried out. I tried it and followed with the double duty moisturizer it's darn good.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,B liked it,I bought this along with the First Class Travel kit or whatever for B's Christmas present. He said his face feels so much cleaner and doesn't need a lot of product to cleanse. Win for him.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Balanced out my crazy skin,"I get dry patches around my chin in the winter and then break out from having to hydrate it so much. I bought the travel size of this and alternated uses with my FAB Cleanser. It was amazing how quickly this balanced out my weird combination problem areas. My little bumps went away, the dryness got better, and it didn't irritate my sensitive skin. Repurchased twice and I highly recommend to anyone with any skin type. Ps. works amazing with a konjac sponge to lather up; it also makes you use less."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Amazing for make up removal,I originally purchased this product for my boyfriend and used it one night when I ran out of my usual face wash. This produce is amazing. It removed all of my eye make-up (including mascara) much better than my much more expensive face wash. It also has lovely fresh tingly feel. I love this product and will not be going back to my other face wash. It is also free of parabens and does not test on animals.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,Bought this for my 15 year old son and one for my husband. They both are very happy with it . It helps keep their skin clear . They said it also doesn't make their skin feel dry nor tight .
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,I bought this for my boyfriend because he said he felt like his regular face wash dried his face out. I used it myself and it felt really great. My skin felt really clean and not dried out at all.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Complicated at first,"I bought this for my boyfriend, who has adverse reactions to products rich in sodium lauryl sulfate, like Clearasil.

My first impressions where that it was foamy with a pleasant smell, but he absolutely hated it. For the first week or so, he complained about it breaking him out. Granted, he wasn't moisturizing afterwards..

After the first week and a bit of Jack Black moisturizer, he now seems to love this product, and has had a reduction in both acne and ingrown hairs. His skin also looks less oily, but he can't tell the difference."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Great product,I can stop looking. Great product at a reasonable price point. What more can you ask for?
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,It's good,I like this face wash well enough. It doesn't remove makeup but it's for men so it's not supposed to. I love it after my workout. It leaves my face squeaky clean and the smell is so mild. I wish it lathered up a bit more.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Boyfriend loved it,"my very picky boyfriend loved (not the word he'd use) it. He said it doesn't have a harsh scent and it leaves his face feeling clean. If he doesn't hate it, it's a good thing...."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Excellent,"Bought this with the Jack Black scrub for my 15 year old son. He went from acne to clear skin in a week and his skin has looked beautiful and clear ever since - highly recommend this! We tried a lot of other ""acne"" products - this is for every type of skin but it really worked for him when nothing else did! Love it!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,Not surprised. The foam is just like water.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,Enjoy using this product. Originally bought for my husband but I use it too.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,You'll Be Surprised,"My boyfriend picked up a bottle of this after one of his gym buddies raved about it. After the first use, my boyfriend said it was nothing special. A week later, he was singing this face wash's praises. He said it helped tremendously with his razor burn and ingrown hairs. The benefit I myself noticed was that he no longer has a slight sheen from his oily complexion a few hours after washing his face; his skin now stays matte and fresh-looking throughout the day. However, that's not where the greatness of this product ends. No, sir! Night after night of seeing a brand new product on my bathroom shelf that I had not tried finally got to me, and I gave in to the curiosity that product junkies find all too familiar. Lemme tell you, ladies, you will LOVE this face wash. It took off my makeup in one wash. ONE. It even removed my water-resistant mascara. It isn't hydrating, at least not for me, but it also isn't drying; I do use a toner and moisturizer after washing, though. As my purchase history will prove, I've bought a ridiculous number of face washes through the years, but I'd never found one like this. Seriously, if Jack Black repackaged this in something girly, women would buy this up by the truckload. More women need to know how wonderful this ""man wash"" is!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,My husband loves this stuff. It doesn't dry his skin out and helps control oil production.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Husband loves it,"Bought the 16oz for the hubby and he really likes it. He said that it smells really nice and he's really picky. In his own words, ""two thumbs and two toes up!"""
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Love this Stuff!,Used a few samples and they are awesome! My face feels so clean and pores are much cleaner and smaller even after just a few uses! Would recommend for men and women :) I am ordering a full size now.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser is fantastic,Jack Black's Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser is a great product for before the shave and after. It leaves your face feeling clean and new. I suggest pairing this cleaner with Jack Black's Face Buff scrub and Beard Lube for shaving.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Good,My husband loves it! It keeps his oily skin with large pores clean!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Blackhead Eraser!,"GREAT face wash. Gets almost completely rid of my teenage son's blackheads, which were pretty bad. I never found a product that actually accomplished this before --- and I've tried a ton of products. Amazing stuff!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Great,My husband just started using this and now swears by it. He will never use anything else ever again. He is diabetic and has very dry skin. It's helps to keep him moisturized.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,My boyfriend loves it,I ve bought several different facial cleanser for my boyfriend and this one is his favorite. And he's using his second one now. It's super oil controlling but won't dry his face at all. Try it guys!!!!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Not Just for Men!,"Yes, this is marketed for men, but boy is it a great cleanser. This is my go-to cleanser. Removes every trace of makeup, even stubborn eye makeup, and it works fabulously with my Clarisonic. I have sensitive skin and this actually helps with my redness and doesn't dry out my face. The scent is refreshing too. Love it, and will repurchase."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,I am a girl but...,I love the Jack Black product line. This Cleanser really makes your face feel clean and gets ALL your make up off. Even stubborn eye make up! It doesn't dry out your skin while controlling dirt and oil. I love this stuff and buy it for all the guys in my life (who all adore it as well!).
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"I bought this for my boyfriend who kept sneaking my face wash. He normally describes everything as ""good"", so I was shocked when he said ""I really like it!"" That's how I know this is a great product. I might start sneaking his face wash!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,A little harsh for sensitive skin,"Only used a sample size so maybe my skin needed to adjust a bit longer, but each time I washed I had quite a bit of redness and irritation on my cheeks. Applied a cooling lotion afterwards and skin was very clean and soft. Might not be the best product for someone with sensitive skin though."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Squeaky clean,"I like that this product is fragrance-free and focuses on being natural. At first I thought the consistency was a little bit too liquidy and would prefer something thicker. But once I started using it, I became a big fan. I love how it feels. Lathers up and gets nice and foamy. My face feels squeaky clean, but not dry or tight. Also not too moisturized; there's no film residue. It really seems to have found the right balance."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Great facial cleanser,"You really only need a small amount of this per wash which makes this a great value on top of it being a great facial cleanser.

+ cleanses well, does not feel like a light-weight cleanser
+ great clean scent (refreshing and invigorating)
+ non-irritating and does not leave skin dry

Am a big fan of this product and the Anthony Logistics Glycolic Facial Cleanser."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,No difference,"This product does leave my face smooth, but it didnt' really help my skin. I prefer the buffer version over this because this one didn't do anything and my face did not feel as clean as when i used the buff version."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,The Best!!,"I had no idea this was for men. I ordered it as a sample because I needed a good cleanser. Used it last night and I will be purchasing. The scent is awakening and calming at the same time. My face has never felt that clean. My pores were breathing on their own. My face doesn't feel that good after a mask, peel, or exfoliator. Everyone should try this."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Would buy again,"Clean, refreshing- a little goes a long way. Does not dry out my skin. Would definitely buy again."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Total Transformation,"My husband has FINALLY decided to stop using bar soap and aftershave as his skin routine and start taking care of his skin. Hellsville must have frozen over. So of course I rushed him to my Sephora and turned ""my people"" loose on him to pick the proper products for what he needs: JB Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser, JB Protein Booster Eye Rescue, JB Protein Booster Skin Serum, and JB Double Duty Face moisturizer. And $200 later, he has a new skin regimen! And has been using them all religiously to exact package directions.
It's been almost a month now and his skin has transformed itself. Wrinkles have filled. Dark spots have faded. Skin is tighter and smooth. His skin looks younger, fresher and.....dare I say.....dewey. He looks fab!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Good stuff !!!,I buy this for my husband an he is really liking it so far. We will continue to buy.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Good for A man's Skin,"This product cleanses without drying. Doesn't leave a residue, either. Good stuff."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Works Well!,My boyfriend uses this and his skin has cleared up so much! It wont clean out all the blackheads and clear his skin completely but it has gotten much much better! I occasionally use it as well just because it feels good to switch between face washes!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Amazing,"I've been using Jack Black products for a month now and everyone is complementing my skin! Coworkers, friends, family, even my friend who works for La Mer complimented my skin. Highly recommend it for even girls!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"I love this cleanser. It is non drying and removes the most stubborn eye make up. The scent is pleasant and well I know it is geared towards men, it really works with my sensitive skin."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,fiance's favorite,"Well not from personal experience (because I am a girl) but i can tell you that its the only face wash my fiance will use. Every time i go to Sephora, he makes sure he has some ;-)"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Great Face Cleanser,this is the best clkeaser - it makes your skoin feell so fresh and clean and alive!!
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Conditioning Micellar Cleansing Water,Singapore,Madame ,"Thoughtful product design that helps reduce wastage or spillage. A good replacement of the usual foam facial cleanser. Closes the pores, removes grease on the skin and leaves skin feeling fresh and clean! "
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Conditioning Micellar Cleansing Water,Singapore,Ms,It's an OK product. Left a slightly sticky feeling on my skin. Makes me wish to rinse it off which defeats the purpose of micellar water. Used the bioderma one long time back and didn't remember feeling the same stickiness. 
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Australia,Gentle cleansing oil ,I started using cleansing oils a few years ago when I was told other types of cleansers were contributing to my dry skin. My skin is also sensitive so not having fragrance added to products is important. This cleanser works well at cleaning my skin whilst also being mild and gentle. The only downside I’ve found is the glass bottle. I’m so nervous about dropping it or knocking it over and breaking it. I like the product itself but wouldn’t repurchase solely because of the glass. 
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Australia,ms,"Very good product. Clean properly, I use it for removing the sunscreen. Works well. No smell, no dryness or any unpleasant feeling. Love the texture and how it works on skin. Easy to wash out."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Great,"Great cleanser and gentle enough for my sensitive skin, the only con is that a bit pricey. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Australia,take times for melting down make up; clog pores ,"I like it because it's natural ingredients compare to other make up cleaning oil. however, i need to repeat 2-3times (sometimes need extra eye make-up remover on top to melt down waterproof mascara).
it just time consuming, as well cost 3times more of product to get the job done; considering 2-3pumps at a timex3. which means you will need about 7pumps to get the make up removed. (and I am not wearing heavy make up, just very light touch foundation, and eye shadow powder, and mascara)
after wash, yes it's not drying your skin; actually you can feel something is left on the face which my daily gentle face cleaner cannot wash it off. after a few use, a lot of little clog pores..it create another skin concern "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Cleanser,Love the texture and really suitable as a morning cleanser and it will not make your skin dry. It doesnt have a strong smell.Definitely gonna repurchase.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,Use it properly!,"I really love this, it is beautiful and luxurious. It doesn’t irritate my skin and makes it soft. Those who are saying it leaves a residue and there is makeup left- it is a cleansing oil, not a face wash. If you wear makeup you are supposed to double cleanse, cleansing oil softens your makeup and breaks it down and then you wash your face with a cleanser to completely remove it from your face. If you wear makeup you should be double cleansing, even just using a cleanser once isn’t enough. You also have to shake the bottle before using it and i use about two-three pumps for a full face of makeup. Again it is made to break up makeup not completely remove it, and the film that is on your skin is meant to be washed off with another cleanser. It is a very gentle formula which i love. I have tried other cleansing oils and they don’t work half as well as this one. I wear lots of glitter on my eyes and after using this and the ordinary’s fulvic acid wash my face is completely clean. If you aren’t using the product properly, you aren’t going to get desired results."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,Turned my face red,"I thought this was just an oil cleanser but it has AHA in it. I instantly had a reaction, my face turned bright right and was so itchy. I’m used to AHAs but my skin hated this. So bummed I was look forward to loving this."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Doesn’t work for removing makeup,I wanted a natural and oil based cleanser to remove my makeup. This does not work to remove makeup well. It never emulsified the makeup or really made it come off easily how I wanted. I have to follow up with a microfiber cloth to actually clean anything off. I can’t recommend this product.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Not Worth It,Love some of the lines other products but this is not it. Very liquid and left face feeling unclean - extremely gentle… too gentle and required additional cleansers. Price point is NOT worth it. Skip.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Australia,Multi Cleanse,"So many cleansers, clean skin but struggle to remove make-up, especially eye make-up. No problem with this one, it ticks all the boxes gentle on skin & eye area. Feels clean & Healthy.
Just make sure you apply to damp skin after giving it a couple of shakes so product blends to reveal a cloudy white colour. It’s normal for ingredients to separate 50/50 when bottle is upright the magic happens when shaken!
"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,"This is the only cleanser/cleansing oil that has worked for my combination, acne-prone skin! It’s very gentle, love the smell, and that it’s an environmentally concious brand. Will definitely be purchasing again."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Australia,disappointing ,"Really disappointed with this product I feel there are other cleansing oils cheaper that are way better, also for an oil cleanser it doesn’t take off my makeup the way it should "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Australia,it’s a great product but not for me I think ,"Super awesome product. I have combination skin and I know the description says all skin types can use it, it’s just not the case at all. Made my skin oilier which other cleansing oils haven’t done. I didn’t break out more than usual but it definitely made my forehead super oily, more than usual, to the point it made my makeup slip many times. Now I just use it in the shower to take off my makeup on my body which works really well. I like the smell of it and it does leave your skin well moisturised. If you have combo/ oily skin not for you! Definitely try on dry skin cuz it worked well for my cheeks which are always dry and it felt super soft and hydrated!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,do not remove base makeup completely,"It is gentle and has a nice aroma when applying to face. 

This cleansing oil is great to remove sunscreens but I would not recommend to anyone use more than a sunscreen to remove the foundations and concealers. I only do light makeup but still need a little bit concealer for hyper pigmentations here and there. I had 5 pumps for one cleaning and massaged in a circular motion for about 1 min to get the makeup resolved, but it still left residue on my skin and caused blackheads the next day, even a tinted moisturizer wouldn’t work. 

I follow with my regular cleanser afterwards and I have dry skin and do not break out much after teenage years. 

I like how soft it makes my skin feels but definitely wouldn’t recommend to remove base makeup. I tried several times by increasing the amount I use but I guess it is not for makeup, of course I’d still recommend to give it a try for anyone who is too sensitive and drying for foaming cleansers and does not wear makeup."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Australia,absolute favourite,"This is my favourite cleanser I have ever used! The perfect cleanser for morning and night. First product I used in the morning to cleanse my skin before a long day of makeup. I also use this after I take off my makeup to ensure all makeup has been removed and that my skin is properly cleanser. Leaves my faces feeling clean, fresh and smooth!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,"This product was gifted to me by KORA Organics. The cleanser does a nice job removing all of my sunscreen and makeup from my face and it washes away fairly easily. This claims to be dual acting but I still follow up with a hydrating cleanser after I use this. I’m not a huge fan of all the added fragrances and essential oils, but luckily my skin had no reaction to them. If you have very sensitive skin, do a patch test before using it all over your face! The packaging is absolutely gorgeous and the oil looks like it’s literally glowing in the glass bottle."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,High Quality,I was able to try this cleansing oil from Kora Organics and I'm highly satisfied with the high quality. I used this formula day & night as my cleanser and my skin is super soft. This formula is cleansing and hydrating at the same time! I love how it smells it's very natural and not floral at all. This is my first experience with a milk product and the results are awesome! Highly recommend. I was gifted by Kora Organics.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Didn’t feel clean,I was not a fan of how oily my face felt after and it didn’t feel clean at all!
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,STICKY,"I can't go without a double cleanse 2x a day, so I was excited to receive this as a deluxe sample. This is easily the worst oil cleanser I've ever used. It's extremely thick and left a thick film on my skin. Luckily I did not break out, so I tried it once more and made sure to shake the bottle really well but once again, nope. Very sticky and I'm surprised to see all of the great reviews. I wish Sephora would carry the Shu Umura oils."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Feels nice but burns eyes,"I liked the feel and smell of this cleanser and it worked well enough, but it burns my eyes so bad. Not sure how you are supposed to remove eye makeup with this. My skin did feel soft and clean after a second cleanse though."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Your Fellow Beauty Addict,"So let’s start with I’m a sucker for anything new. I’ve been on the hunt for a cleanser that can solve mask-acne. Safe  to say this may not be it. Beautiful packaging and a decent product. If you are a Semi to Full face beat wearer this is not the cleanser for you. It’s not very effective at removing makeup, not even as a second cleanse after makeup removal. However for a morning cleanse/refresh it’s great. Very gentle and moisturizing. It does leaving a moisturizing feel on the skin. It’s doesn’t bother me. And didn’t disrupt my morning routine with other products or makeup app. So I’ll keep it for that. But for real cleansing of pores...this is not it."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Gets the job done,This product was gifted to me by Kira Organics for review. It’s become one of my new favorite makeup removers. I love how gentle it is on my skin while still removing all of my makeup. I would suggest doing a test strip on your skin first because it is scented.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,dry-skin bestie,"Over 50, dry-skin loves this cleanser!  Nearly fragrance-free as a bonus...I wear physical sunscreen every day and this removes it well (I do a swipe with cotton-swab& micellar water after)  I use 8-10 pumps and hope to continue buying at Sephora!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,Disappointed,Smells and feels amazing. I was so excited to buy this cleanser as I love the idea of Kora Organics and Miranda Kerr. I ordered this right away even if I was still into my Origins oil cleanser. This cleanser smells and feels great and would spend hours rubbing my face with it...but it doesn’t remove my face makeup! It doesn’t leave my face feeling fresh or clean. I had to return and felt so sad doing so.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Love the texture of this and it leaves my skin so soft.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Disappointed with product,This product is weird as it is not an oil and have to rub hard to get it to even penetrate my makeup a little. I feel that for this price it should be easier and better to use. Very disappointed
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,WET YOUR FACE BEFORE APPLYING TO SEE THE GREATNESS,"The reviews that claim that this cleansing oil leaves your face greasy and doesn't take off makeup well is all true UNLESS you follow the directions. I am used to applying oil cleansers directly onto dry skin to melt my makeup, especially my waterproof mascara, so I did the same for this. It didn't do anything. I read the directions which clearly say to apply onto a damp face, but I apply it on wet face and it works wonderfully. It removed all of my makeup and rinsing it washes it all off, leaving the slightest bit of ""greasiness"" that honestly just feels like a nice barrier of moisture. I love how sturdy and elegant the packaging looks and feels, how it smells, and how it makes my skin feel hydrated. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS ON THE PACKAGE Y'ALL! Wet your face before applying."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,holy. grail.,"i’ve tried everything for my trash pores. i saw a tik tok that suggested an oil cleanser. tried this one. got immediate results. immediate. instant. so immediate that I texted all my friends. all 2 of them. called my mother. bought a bottle for my brother and his gf. i massaged it all over my face/neck with one of those gentle silicone scrubbers, really working it in. it melts away all the garbage packed in your pores without the damage or inflammation from using a strip or peeling mask. i’m so obsessed that i bought 2 more bottles directly from their site. p.s. i rarely wear make-up. i’m 40. i’ve purchased everything under the sun w/o these fantastic results. skin feels the softest everrrrrr after using this. i’m going to go wash my face again for fun rn."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Great idea but not there yet,"Disappointed, didn’t perform how I wanted. Just water to me. Fresh oil cleanser is much better."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,An Amazing Silk and Moisturizing type of Cleanser,"I've been using this product for almost two weeks now and I instantly felt in love with this cleanser. I have a combination skin and this cleanser isn't too oily and I felt the silkiness when I applied it on my face and even after I washed my face. I mixed well before using this cleanser. It also removed all my make up including eyes. After I washed my face with this cleanser and accidentally left my face without applying a cream until the next mid morning and didn't feel dryness at all. It was still moisturizing. I've never experienced a cleanser like this before. I've used Dior, Chanel, Estee Lauder and all different types of cleansers and so far this product is the number one pick. Also, it is amazing how the cleanser keeps my face hydrating and moisturizing even after I washed and left it overnight without applying any cream. I really LOVE this cleanser and it's amazing how this cleanser was built! Hoping KORA makes creams similar to Milky Mushroom Gentle collection."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,"Okay, I did get a sample of this first. It does not remove my waterproof mascara at all!! I tried it on my face dry, damp, and wet, and still nothing. If you don’t wear heavy or waterproof makeup, then I’m sure it’s great. But why spend so much when there’s other options that remove absolutely everything."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,So great!,It got all my makeup off and left my skin feeling so fine afterward! Definitely recommend
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Burns my eye rim,"Not for sensitive eyes, the AHA's in this product burn the rim of my eyes all day long. Kora should really keep their Foaming Cleanser in the line up.  It was their most gentle cleanser.  This oil cleanser is not a good replacement."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,So Nice!,"I’m so surprised to see the negative reviews! I tried a small sample of this from the rewards bazar and I loved it. I used it as my first cleanse on a full face of makeup and eyes, followed by the Indie Lee brightening cleanser and my white towels were spotless. Totally removed my eye makeup (and I had several layers of mascara on). I’d definitely purchase the full size"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,It feels so Luxurious,"This product was gifted to me by Kora Organics. For my honest review of the product. 
I wasn't sure what to expect from this product. Since it's NEW , I was really excited to try it. It feels really nice on your skin. It took off my makeup without any issues.I thought it was going to leave my face oily. And it was going to just stay sitting on top of my skin. WOW, I was totally Wrong ! It not only absorbs into your skin really good. It leaves your skin super soft and hydrated.There was a noticeable difference in my skin texture. I love love this product and love that its Organic. It's absolutely my new favorite cleansing oil. It does what I need it to do. And doesn't irritate my skin or make me break out. This is exactly what I have been looking for."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Doesn’t Remove Mascara,"This cleanser feels good while applying, but it does NOT remove eye makeup- like at all. I’ve tried using on wet skin, dry skin and even after a light first cleanse. I’ve wasted so much product trying to remove eye makeup with it."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,DO NOT get unless YOUR SKIN IS SUPER SUPER DRY,Making if you have EXTREMELY & I mean EXTREMELY dry skin this might work for you . I wanted a gentle hydrating cleanser for in the morning. This does not emulsify like the Tatcha oil cleansing oil . It literally will not come off your skin ! It feels like an veerryyy oily layer is left on the skin . I tried hot water ... and it still just feels like a layer of oil stuck on the skin ..... I have very normal skin but I tend to swim a lot so I wanted something hydrating but this is another level of hydration/: my skin felt so oily ..... & even caused breakouts because my skin got congested by how oily it is . I had to return it ):
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,"I love, love, love this product, Its simply amazing. I did not have to cleanse a second time. It took all of my make up off the first time. I would definitely recommend this cleanser to a friend."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,"TERRIBLE, waste of money!","Terrible cleanser, if you can even call this a cleanser. Super watery formula, NOT an oil cleanser whatsoever coming from an avid oil cleanser fan. Doesn’t remove my makeup, leaves mascara raccoon eyes after washing TWICE with this cleanser. I don’t understand how this product has so many good reviews. I would never purchase this again. And for reference I’ve only have this product for 1 week and my bottle is already 1/4 of the way gone because you need to pump so much of this watery formula to even get anything on your face."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,Dose not work !,I wish I could say I love this product but it just can't remove my make up!
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,"Didn’t do anything. Left my skin just as it was with make up on, plus with an oily feeling."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Pore reducing blackhead destroying miracle,"Let me start off by saying that I don’t feel this would be a sufficient stand alone makeup remover type cleanser, however this is NOT what I purchased this for. I received a deluxe sample and initially I would use a little then not think about it for a while. As the season is getting warmer and I find myself sweating on my face more and dealing with the greasy fallout that you inevitably have to deal with when you consistently use face sunscreen, I’ve become more aware of how this particular cleaner completely remidies that situation at the end of the day. This cleanser beautifully removes the sunscreen and superficial excessive skin oil without stripping my skin and my pores completely disappear. I’ve never had a cleanser that was able to shrink pores the way this was one does. I’m giving it 5 stars for that alone. Also if you have issues with clogged pores on your nose this cleanser prevents that also. I feel like this is the type of product that you’ll either completely love or completely hate, no in between."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,Great Cleanser!,I love this cleanser! It doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry afterwards and I love the scent. I also love the glass bottle it looks very chic. I’ve definitely noticed my skin getting clearer and more glowing after a few uses.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,"Super watery formula so I felt like I was wasting a lot of product. It is not very good at removing makeup— I don’t wear a ton of makeup to begin with, and none of it is waterproof, and yet this cleanser did an awful job. I know a lot of people love the double cleanse but I don’t see the point of this cleanser because it doesn’t seem to do anything… and then I follow with my normal cleanser that I love anyway, so it is an unnecessary added step. Any moisturizing properties are stripped away with that second cleanse. Occasionally I will use this on a makeup free face and then just follow with a serum and moisturizer— but I worry the oily residue is just blocking my skin from absorbing all of the good stuff in the rest of my routine. I’m glad I tried it but won’t be buying again. It didn’t seem to do any harm— but I don’t have problematic skin."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Not totally amazing~,"I find it to be like all the other cleansing oils I've used, it's the initial thing I use to dissolve makeup but definitely needed a second cleanse with something else. My makeup, and I barely wear any, was still sitting on my face when I rinsed it off. So glad I got a sample first."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,KORAtastic,"I tested the Kora Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleanser gifted by KORA Organics and I LOVE IT! Completely soothing, cleansing and refreshing for your skin. I use it day and night, it removed the day from my face and left me with hydrated milky smooth skin. It also smells divine."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,"It doesn't remove any makeup(even the little), nor sunscreen if follow the directions. Dont waste your money but if you already did then try applying it on the cotton disk, it works a bit better."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Might be gentle - NOT an effective makeup remover,"I'm always on the look-out for the next big thing in oil cleansers.
This one let me down in a big way - if you're looking for something that will take off the makeup - ALL of the makeup, including eye makeup and mascara, this is not it, at least in my opinion.
BTW, I paid for mine."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,WOW,I normally don't write reviews ... Omg this has transformed the texture of my skin. It feels amazing! Highly recommend
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,The Best,"I love a good cleansing oil. I’ve been using Biossance squalane cleansing oil and I really love it, I still believe its a good product. However…….after using the Milky Mushroom  Cleansing Oil, I love how hydrated my face feels after using it. Also, makeup comes right off. I usually have to wait 30 seconds to a minute to get all the waterproof mascara and eyeliner off. But I didn’t have to do that with this little gem. This product will be in my cleansing regimen. My advice…but it."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Great for dry climates,I’ve been using this for about 6 months now and I love it! I live in a pretty dry area and I noticed cleaners I used to use would strip my face dry as well. Since I’ve been using this oil cleanser it’s done a great job of cleansing and keeping my skin hydrated! I’m not sure why previous reviews talk about not actually cleansing away makeup. I wear fenty concealer and foundation and this always takes most of it off.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Blech!,"Thick, does not rinse off clean and does not seem to cut through light makeup. Ya gotta wipe this one off with hot water and a wash cloth or it stays sticky and gross on your face. My sensitive skin flushes red after using this. Hard pass, skip this oil."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,"I am impressed. That is all I can say. This cleanser makes me skin feel so clean, yet so firm and bouncy after use. A little goes a long way. I really like the smell of this too. It is on the pricier side, but it is 100% worth it."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,"The best gentle make up remover i bought.  I apply 6 pomps every time ( so for the price it finishes quickly) and i follow with a makeup wipe ( because to me the Liquid does not go deep enough) , you can use a warm cloth. Seems like not the strongest and expéditive product to remove makeup but still love it.
If you plan on using it to simply wash your face it will do nothing more than to leave oil on your skin and make it dirtier. 
This is a makeup remover only."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,It's okay,I am a big fan of Kora Organics. This cleanser does the job but the smell is a bit strange. Nothing really standing out of this product. Probably won't buy it again.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Bad,Doesn’t clean skin at all. The oil just sits on it and is then hard to remove.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,lovely product!,"love how gentle and non drying this cleanser is! the dual cleansing is a cool feature. be sure to follow the directions and apply to damp skin and shake thoroughly before applying. the smell is nice and subtle and the consistency is a bit watery, it's a milky cleanser. I always use a makeup balm prior to cleansing so I am unable to verify it's ability to remove makeup on it's own. but as a second cleanse it's a lovely experience."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,it’s magic,"I was honestly nervous about purchasing these products, because I didn’t know how my skin would react. I was using another organic and natural skincare line, but my skin was looking dull and I wanted to try something new, and I found these products and I’m never going back. My skin has changed SO much for the better and I love all of it!!! I even have sensitive skin and I tend to breakout with certain products, but this has only improved my skin!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,"I’ve really enjoyed using this cleansing oil lately! I used a sample size a few months prior to buying the full size, and was actually surprised it broke up my liquid liner easily, if it was more stubborn just another pump and it would break it up nicely. It’s definitely worth a try."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Canada,good product,"I always prefer using more natural products when possible, and I was using the fresh brand sea berry skin nutrition cleansing oil but my skin was breaking out horribly. I switched to this, and my breakouts have cleared right up. I normally only wear concealer, but once in a while I’ll wear mascara too - if I wear mascara I use 3 pumps and it takes it right off but when I only wear concealer I just use one to two pumps and it cleanses my skin plus takes the makeup off. Like some other reviews say, it is nearly impossible to wash it all off and it leaves an oily residue on the skin but it doesn’t feel gross or dirty. Either way I’m hoping to find a cleanser I can use with this that won’t strip my skin because it’s still not pleasant having the oily feeling after cleaning which is why I took a star off. Still a great product though! Also would be better if the bottle wasn’t glass, I’ve got a toddler going through my bathroom things all the time PLUS glass doesn’t travel well."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Singapore,great and gentle cleanser ,"Love this! Kora organic made next great product. It’s very gentle yet cleans well. Smell also nice calming. Recently my skin has been very dry due to working long hours on laptop. So this helps to hydrate and moisture my skin.
"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Singapore,love it 💕💕💕,"I am surprised not much asian reviews on this yet. I like this cleansing oil as a morning cleanser or as a evening use to remove spf and double cleanse. It’s not supposed to be used like any cleansing oil on dry skin, this works when you damp your skin before using. Overall, i love how my skin feels soft and healthy after every wash! 
"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Australia,Light oil cleanser,"This is a nice cleanser, however it is really light and does not necessarily have the break down power of other oil cleanser, however I would recommend it for someone who has really dry skin for a morning wash or as apart of a double cleanse system were a person what's an in between of an oil and a milk cleanser which may interest someone with oil skin. The packaging is really lux and I feel that this product is a nice affordable high end organic oil cleanser and would recommend to someone who falls in the categories above."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Thanks kora,"#koraorganicsgiftedme their Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil ($40.00) Thank you!! @koraorganics  
This cleansing oil works deeply yet gently to help remove makeup in a calming manner, especially mascara. I find that I don’t have to rub my eyes so much to get all the makeup off, I simply use gentle circular motions and this cleansing oil softly loosens up all my makeup making it much easier to rinse off. It comes in a recyclable elegant glass bottle, and contains powerful blends to help keep your skin moisturized and supple with ingredients such as silver ear mushroom which is a natural alternative to hyaluronic acid apple seed oil a good source of omega 6 & 9 and sunflower seed oil rich in oleic and linoleic which helps to remove excess oil and dirt Babassau oil rich in essential fatty acids and antioxidants and last but not least energized with clear quartz crystal to bring positivity, calm and clarity to your moment 
It also is organic, free of toxins and cruelty towards creatures and vegan"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,Australia,pretty good!,I love and use almost everything from the Kora range so was very excited about this product. It’s feels really nice and gentle on the skin but I feel like I’m using a lot too quickly. The instructions state to use 5 pumps of product per wash. I’ve had it for one week and love the results but for the price feel like I’ve used too much.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,How gentle yet effective is this Cleanser,"This cleansing milk gently removes makeup, oil and dirt. I used 3 pumps and massaged on to my face..The cleanser has a gentle smell that I really loved..and how easily it removed my makeup..My skin felt so soft and clean."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Oily pupils ! Dirty Skin,"I wanted to like this product SO BAD. I own the entire Kora Organics collection and I love ALL the products. I even pre ordered this one. BUT:
1- No matter how you wash your face, you’ll still end up with oily eyes. And if you wear contacts, forget it ! They are ruined unless you want to walk around with blurry vision 
from the oils inside your eyes.
2-If you have dry, normal, combination or oily skin, you’ll still end up with a layer of oil on your face after washing. NOT MOISTURE , oil that makes you feel dirty.
3-This oils DOES NOT melt with water. It’s just greasy.
4- Will only recommend this product to a person suffering from EXTREMELY ABNORMAL DRY SKIN and to avoid washing their forehead, eyes, around eyes or upper cheeks (which makes no sense since you want to wash your entire face) otherwise the oil will find its way to make it inside your eyes and this will last ALL DAY LONG."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Love this,"I received this product complimentary from KORA  Organics. I was really excited  to try this product and I must say that it is worth all the excitement. I love the packaging of this cleansing oil, very impressive. The cleanser was very natural and leaves a cooling effect on the skin. I have a combination skin and this has been working really well. Definitely recommend this product."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Kora's oil has a forever spot on my makeup table!,"I received this product complimentary from Kora Organics in exchange for my honest feedback, all opinions are my very own. 

This is the cleansing oil for people that don't like cleansing oils! This is a very light formula that's a hybrid between a oil & a gentle cleansing milk that is packed with hydrating oils & a clear quartz crystal to promote clarity & harmony. 

How to use: shake the bottle 2/3 X's before using, massage about 3 pumps onto your dry skin & watch it breakdown your waterproof liners & your mascara. Then add warm water to emulsify, then rinse away with water & or a soft cloth. 

My Thoughts: I personally feel in love with this cleansing oil the very first time I used it. It has the texture of a light milky cleanser but also with a power of the cleansing oil. I myself hate that greasy oily feeling left behind on my skin from certain oils, this cleanser is great for those people like me whom hate that oily texture & products that leave behind a greasy residue. All you get left from this milky mushroom gentle cleansing oil is hydrated clean skin.

Packaging: Let's just start with the fact that the packaging is simply gorgeous, a glass bottle with a beautiful design. 

What is very important, the whole composition is organic & this cleansing milk will definitely take pride of place on my makeup table."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Kora,I received this complimentary from Cora Organic cleanser oil. It is great for cleaning my face of dirt and make up. I use it everyday. It feels great on my skin. I highly recommend this product for anyone.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Lovely but very light formula,"I was kindly gifted by Kora Organics the Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil and these are my thoughts!

The packaging is absolutely lovely and high end. The glad bottle is very heavy and sturdy but I definitely wouldn’t want to drop this! 

The product itself is meant to be emulsified by shaking the bottle and that works easily and quickly. I found the formula to be just as the name says-“milky”. It’s very thin and glides right over the skin. I found this product a little too light for my taste, because I pack on products. But I suspect this would be a lovely cleanser for people with dry skin and/or a minimal skincare routine.

I enjoyed this cleanser but my husband will enjoy it even more so I will be gifting it to him, because men need good skincare too!

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,AMAZING,"I would like to say thank you for allowing me to try the Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing that was gifted to me by KORA Organics for my honest opinion. This is a dual phase (2part) cleansing milk/oil that is meant to cleanse the skin removing dirt and makeup with out being harsh on the skin. This is an AMAZING product with 99% of its ingredients natural and 91% from organic farming. See AMAZING. The most impressive ingredient is from the NONI fruit that is a super food and antioxidant containing more than 100 vitamins and minerals. This cleanser is also energized with Rose Quartz and Clear Quartz meant to bring a soothing energy into my beauty routine. That's pretty AMAZING as well. 
My personal experience has been great thus far and my skin has felt soft, and clean and it gets all my makeup off with no harsh scrubbing. I am HIGHLY pleased with this cleanser. I love how KORA has put their time and pride into this product and used the energy of soothing crystals to help me have a great experience from the moment I use it until I lay my head on my pillow. Great job KORA this one is definitely a winner!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,"Oil, water Magic.","This product was Gifted by Kora Organics and I’m so happy for that!!! At first I was not sure if I would like this product I felt that it might be to oily for my skin but was I wrong! This milky oil feels light, nourishing, and has a mild pleasant natural scent. I like the clean organic ingredients and Love the pump and glass packaging also When it says for all skin types it is truly for all skin types I love the smell it was so light, this face wash made my face feel selkie I have seen a huge decrease in my pore size and I feel like when I use my toner I do not have as much nastiness on my face I was when I did with my other face wash. This is a new most have of me."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Love love love!!!!,Kora Organics gifted me with the Milky Mushroom oil cleanser! This is the coolest and probably my most favorite oil cleanser I have ever tried. I love the soft milky texture that just melts my makeup away. It’s quick and easy and doesn’t keep me away from my baby too long. It smells very nice. I wouldn’t say it is heavily scented or anything. Another thing I find to be very cool is the incorporation of crystals into the product for calm and peace. Really what self love and skin care should be. Thank you kora organics for this complimentary gift to try out!
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Not As Moisturizing As I Had Hoped,"I was totally swept away by the beautiful glass bottle and the way the “Clean at Sephora” ingredients separated to create an intriguing visual. I was pleasantly surprised, after reading other reviews, that this cleanser does in fact remove ALL makeup. I even swept micellar water over my face and eyes afterwards and the pad was clean. What I did find disappointing, however, is that it didn’t seem to leave my face feeling even slightly moisturized, something that my Youth to the People Superfood Antioxidant Cleanser is great for. So while I normally just steam my face with a washcloth in the morning, I might try using this. The ingredients themselves are noteworthy and beneficial to your skin, so I plan on using all of this product to see if the results are worth repurchasing. To be honest though, my skin doesn’t need much help; I just really liked the bottle (:"

It’s got a natural smell, I use it with a cotton pad to remove make up and such and then just as a normal cleanser and it’s very gentle yet effective!

I really enjoy using this product as it feels so velvety yet cleans up your face without stripping out dry. I like how gentle yet powerful it is. It sure is a great product to have. #milkycleanser #noniglow
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Bad Experience,"My skin is normal to dry & sensitive and this cleansing oil just doesn’t work for me. First, this contains geranium & rose oil which I love the smell of but essential oils aren’t great for those like me with sensitive skin. Yes, this does contain some amazing oils that are great fir the akin but you wash this off so I’m not sure if those would be of benefit to the skin. This is the same for the mushroom extract. This doesn’t contain lactic acid (aha) but again, not sure the skin benefits since it doesn’t stay on the skin. Aside from the above ingredients, this is gentle but leaves a weird film/residue on the skin that I just couldn’t stand. After using this one night, I woke up to pimples which I never breakout. This was gifted by KORA Organics."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Awesome product!,This product was gifted by Kora organically! This is such a gentle effective formula. I love how the smell isn't overpowering. The formula breaks down the makeup and gets in hard to reach/problematic areas so well. I also love that it doesn't burn my eyes and leave my skin irritated!
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Gentle and effective,"Kota orgánica gifted me their new milky oil cleanser. I love using it as the first step to break down sunscreen, primer, and any makeup from my day. The bottle is glass and looks super luxurious on my vanity."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Good Morning Cleanse,"Complimentary from Kora Organics. It isn't the easiest thing to use for me.
Firstly, you have to remember to shake the bottle before use and it doesn't remove makeup at all. I ended up working it a lot to remove my mascara which I generally do not have to do and it's not great for the eye area. I used it on the days I wore just sunscreen and I think it did a decent job but I do have to spend a few extra seconds to work it in. At the end of the day I would like to use products that are effective and convenient. I will end up using this on the  body or as a morning cleanser"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,"while this packaging is beautiful and i love the concept of oil cleansers, i do think this one really lacks in the makeup removing capability that i expect from an oil cleanser. if you plan to use it as a first cleanse in a double cleansing routine to remove makeup, i would say pass on this, because it really doesn’t have as much makeup removing power. it works nicely as a morning cleanser or a no makeup day cleanser, as it’s quite lightweight and has a nice texture, but i am a little disappointed that it doesn’t remove makeup as well as i feel an oil cleanser should. i received this product complimentary from kora organics to review."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Just okay. Thin like water. Overly scented.,"First off the packaging is a beautiful, sturdy glass bottle with a pump (no cap). Looks and feels very elegant. As for the product I think it does a decent job as a first cleanse to remove makeup, but its not super heavy duty. There are two things I very much dislike about this cleanser. One is the overpowering scent, which smells like a mix of herbs and floral perfume. I dont need my cleanser to make my face smell good. I have sensitive skin and fragrance sends to irritate it and cause it to break out. Fortunately I haven't experienced any breakouts, however I always go in with a second cleanser (I use the Cerave Hydrating Cleanser for my second wash). The second issue I have is with the essence like consistency. It feels like you are putting water on your skin and I definitely feel the need for something a little thicker and that slightly resembles an oil. 

Overall I wouldn't recommend this as I think its just okay and I dislike the smell and texture. Its not worth the price in my opinion.

This product was gifted to me by KORA Organics in exchange for my honest review."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,"Complimentary from Kora Organics. Ok so I love the feel of this cleansing oil. It’s so thin and smooth and smells lovely. However, it does not take any of my eye makeup off, especially mascara. Maybe this is good for a no makeup day but it’s not my fave."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Soft and bouncy skin!,"Kora Organics gifted me this cool NEW Milky Mushroom Cleansing Oil. Now available at Sephora. They call it a dual-phase cleanser that mixes into a luxurious milk texture. This is like the most delicious salad dressing vinaigrette which can be called another dual-phase of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, for your face!!!

The bottom has the texture of egg whites. The thick oil texture contains sunflower seed, apple seed and babassu oils that float on top. When you shake, it turns into a velvety light milk. It has an oil slip that removes dirt and excess oil. The first time I used it I thought it felt soapy, I kept expecting the suds but the more I massaged the more it felt like a luxurious oil.

The star ingredient in this is the Silver Ear Mushroom. This super mushroom has the same chemical structure of Hyaluronic Acid and retains even more moisture.

I usually practice double-cleansing, this is a 2 in 1 kinda product. I noticed it only did an ok job with removing all traces of makeup though. I prefer to use this in the AM as my only cleanser or in the PM after removing with micellar water first.

I was almost expecting it to leave a film but it didn’t! It doesn’t strip the skin, it’s very gentle. It actually leaves your skin very smooth, soft, super bouncy and hydrated. I seriously recommend it but not for removing makeup.

I found it really cool that their products are energized with clear and rose quartz, also certified organic. I really dig this brand, it’s pricy but it’s quality. Also really enjoyed the Noni Night AHA Serum...check it out."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Nice gentle cleanser,"I love this cleanser, it is super gentle, three pumps are enough to clean my whole face. I love that it doesn't leave a residue. I don't think it would clean waterproof makeup. It has a nice subtle scent.
This product was complimentary from Kota Organics."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,A good luxe oil cleansing option,"Love this product as a first cleanse! If you like cleansing oil over a balm and are looking for a more luxurious option, this is a great pick. It smells so good and is effective at breaking up makeup. I don't like this for eye makeup removal but I usually don't like oil/balm cleansers for eye makeup removal. It's a little higher priced but if you're looking for a that organic luxe experience this is it! Product was gifted by Kora Organics."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Gorgeous packaging,Kora Organics gifted me their Milky Mushroom gentle oil cleanser and I am absolutely obsessed! The packaging is gorgeous and I love this as a first cleanse. Oil attracts oil so this does a great job at removing makeup and leaving behind beneficial ingredients that leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated. Im so in love!
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Perfect for my dry skin,"I love this cleansing oil. I have very dry skin and this helps the dryness while gently removing makeup and dirt. Definitely feel and see a difference! This will be part of my facial routine permanently.

I received this product complimentary from Kora Organics in exchange for my honest review."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,love it,"#koraorganicsgiftedme their Milky Mushroom gentle cleaning oil.

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,"I was so intrigued when I first saw this as I have wanted to try Kora Organics for a while.  I am a huge fan of oil cleansers; they work so well for my skin. 

This is an oil cleanser with that milky aspect. The bottle is heavy to give it a luxe feel. Good news I dropped it on DAY 1, and it did not break! You shake to combine, then wash the day away! 

It's a very liquid texture, so make sure you cup your hands. It has a nice slip and does not dry my skin. My skin feels hydrated after, almost filmy. I'm not sure if I like it and prefer to cleanse after with my regular cleanser. It is also quite a strong-smelling product. I am not opposed to fragrance, but if you do not like fragrance in your products or are sensitive, this might be too strong for you.

As for removing make up, didn't do a thing. I had to use two additional cleansers for a light make-up day.  If I do not wear any eye makeup, this would probably suffice. 

To review, I love the ingredients, but I only use this on no makeup days and as the first cleanse in my routine.

I enjoyed this product by Kora. I liked the consistency of it and how it made my skin felt after each use. At first I was a little hesitant since I have combo skin and thought this product would leave my skin feeling oily but boy I was wrong. Kora Organics Milky Mushroom cleaning oil got rid of all my makeup and left my skin feeling fresh, clean and soft!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,So hydrating,"I recieved the Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil complimentary from Kora Organics! One thing I immediately noticed was that the consistency was very milky as opposed to oily. I was able to remove all of my eye makeup with one swipe and my skin was left feeling plump and hydrated! 
If you have oily skin, I would recommend using this as a first step Cleanser !"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,It’s a game changer!,This is my first Kora product ever after wanting to try the brand for years. This is the best product to start with. The word mushroom intrigued me a lot because I know it’s hydrating. It removes makeup very well without stripping the skin or burning my eyes! Product was gifted by Kora Organics.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Love it,Kota organic gifted me thr milky cleanser which I am in love with! It is so so moisturizing keeps my skin soft and hydrated love how the texture becomes so milky! I honestly love organic products because they are safe to use in skin
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Gentle and non-stripping,"I received this cleansing oil complimentary from Kora Organics in exchange for an honest review. I’ve been enjoying this cleanser because it’s gentle and nonstripping. It’s a great first cleanser as it melts light makeup, sunscreen and dirt away. I love that the ingredients are very nourishing too. Must try!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Amazing!,Complimentary from KORA Organics. The Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil is amazing! Packaging and glass bottle is so pretty. It has a light scent. The consistency isn’t too runny. I have dry/dull skin. I love how it hydrates and gives my skin a glow! It also removed my eyebrow pomade very well compared to other cleansers I’ve used.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Super gentle cleanser,"** I received the product complimentary from KORA Organics.

First of all, I love the luxurious glass bottle packaging, although I do have to be careful shaking it so I don't drop it! The biphase formula mixes well and 3 pumps is enough for my whole face. I love the light oil texture, it doesn't feel thick or heavy and is easy to spread on the skin. Don't care for the lavender oil scent but that's just my personal preference. 

As for its cleansing power, I would use something stronger for waterproof makeup, but otherwise this removed light makeup well and didn't leave a film behind. Feels extremely gentle and comfortable on the skin too!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,"Complimentary from Kora Organics 

I received this product as a PR gift, however I dont think it is strong enough to remove the makeup and its hard to shake the liquid it requires some muscle work until blended."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil,USA,"A gentle, moisturizing cleanser","This cleanser was complimentary from Kora Organics in exchange for my honest review. Kora Organics nailed the luxe skincare vibes with this cleanser and I was immediately impressed with its heavy glass bottle and beautiful branding. The Milky Mushroom Gentle Cleansing Oil is a dual-phase cleanser that promises to remove your makeup and cleanse your skin all in one step. At first, I made the mistake of applying this on dry skin, like a traditional cleansing oil and while it worked it wasn't quite as effective. This cleanser is meant to be used on damp skin. This will remove minimal sunscreen and makeup but I had trouble removing heavier mascara so I don't think this will work for everyone as an effective makeup remover. It has an herbal, spa-inspired scent and no added fragrance which I quite like but I can see others disliking the smell of it. It does leave a slight moisturizing feel on the skin after rinsing, so if that's not your thing I don't think you will like this cleanser. I am an avid double cleanser and I prefer this one for my morning cleanse as I like a really deep clean at night."
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,USA,Very impressed!,"This cleanser has a subtle pleasant scent and it is gentle. It doesn’t strip out all the moisture and natural oil from your face like many other cleansers, but still does a good job cleansing. I personally don’t like that squeaky clean feeling because that means the cleanser is too harsh and stripped out your skin. This cleanser does not do that! Plus it comes in a big tube!"
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Australia,Amazing,"this is the first cleanser that I've brought that actually does what it says. it does take away all makeup. no more panda eyes. it is a little bit drying, but perks up with moisturiser. really amazing clean skin"
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,USA,you won’t be disappointed,"Holy grail cleanser for sensitive, inflamed, acne prone skin. It’s a true gel consistency and doesn’t foam. It’s gentle and soothing but very effective in terms of cleaning"
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Australia,Great cleanser,I have been using this cleanser for years - it is gentle and works well on my combination dry/oily skin. You definitely need to use an eye make-up remover and occasionally double cleanse for night make-up but it's a great every day/night cleanser. My only issue is that it is hard to find in the 500ml pump bottle.
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Malaysia,Average cleanser,This cleanser is very gentle but it doesn’t foam at all so leaving me feeling my face is not being cleaned. Maybe good second cleanser for double cleansing. Will not repurchase
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Australia,my holy grail,"I’ve been using this cleanser for many months now and I absolutely love it, it soothes my skin and isn’t overly drying or harsh. So cost effective and 1 bottle lasts a long time "
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Singapore,clean,is a natural compound that helps protect the skin barrier and prevents irritation from retinol
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Australia,Ms,I am not in love with this - I know that it’s not  a foaming wash but I feel like I have to use a tonne of it in order for it to clean my skin. It has no fragrance and it’s a clear gel so it just makes the whole experience of cleansing a bit boring. I won’t repurchase. 
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Malaysia,Weird Cleanser,"This cleanser is simply one of the weirdest cleansers I have ever used. It has a gel texture which melted into water when I rubbed it on my face but because it had become so watery it drained away so quickly before I could even finish cleaning my face. I ended up using a lot of it each time I cleaned my face and what made it even worse was that my face didn’t feel clean afterwards and needed a second cleanse - I don’t usually wear make up so I never had this problem of double cleansing with almost all other cleansers apart from Tata Harpers cleansers but Tata Harpers cleansers don’t ‘drain away’ when they emulsify like this one. Luckily I only got a trial size, another questionable product from Alpha H "
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Australia,my go to cleanser! ,"I love that this is a gel. I always feel like it’s cleans my skin really well without leaving any oily residue. I keep purchasing it, so I must like it! 
"
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Australia,triple action ,When I ordered this I didn't realise it was going to be so big. It comes in a large tube and it will last a long time. It has no scent and it is not soapy. 
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Malaysia,two minds,"Hmm even though I love the smell, Im not sure if it really cleans my face well. Becoz of gel texture, I feel it’s not suitable for using with Foreo. Good thing is that it doesn’t make my sensitive skin break out. Anyway, I would not repurchase it."
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Australia,My Go-To Second Cleanse ,"I’ve gotten into the routine of a second cleanse, I use this Alpha-H Cleanser first and I pair it with the Ole Henrikson AHA Cleanser. My combination skin has never looked better. Over course dealing with the monthly hormonal breakouts but this product has really set the standard for my skin care. "
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Malaysia,it works,i work during this pandemic era with my PPE always on but this product actually works. I have less acne despite being in a heat. and this is my second purchased.
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Australia,Been using this for almost 15 years,"Been using this since I was 15. So nearly 15 years.. (thanks for the recommendation mum)
It is my staple, will never be with out it. So many things have come and gone from my routines over the years but this isn't going anywhere.  Having sensitive acne prone skin, for years this cleanser had been the one thing I could always rely on. 
Super gentle. Australian made. Great reliable product!  Highly recommend
"
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,USA,This is the one!,"I will use this forever! The smell is so soothing. The gel texture feels calming and removes every speck of makeup, including mascara, and doesn’t sting my eyes. Balances out my combination skin. Packaging even looks so clean on a countertop. Only thing I would change is the way the product has to be distributed by unscrewing the bulky cap each time, so it can get a little messy putting the cap back on."
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Australia,"Light, non-irritating. ","This is a good, simple cleanser. Removes make-up well and leaves skin feeling plump and fresh. It would be good to see Alpha-H move to more sustainable packaging. "
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Malaysia,Nice Cleanser,this is my first time and i love using this cleanser. its a very gentle gel cleanser yet effective. i would not mind repurchasing this again in the future.
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Australia,Obsessed with Alpha H!,"This is my absolute favourite cleanser. The non-foaming aspect was a bit strange to get used to at first, but it does the job just as well and feels so gentle and beautiful on my skin. Would recommend! "
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,USA,Alpha-H Triple Action Cleanser - 185ml,"Compliments of Influenster, I really enjoyed this cleanser. Super gentle, smells great, highly recommended!"
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Australia,Good cleanser,"Good product, wish it foamed up a little bit more. Isn’t the best at getting makeup off, but is good for an everyday cleanser as I don’t wear makeup daily. "
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Malaysia,juz ok,"i buy this cleanser juz want to try it since i love the rose cleanser(from annyversary kit) .... overall is ok,it's not produce the foam since it in gel texture...  make me feel not sure either it is really clean my face or not.. but it doesnt breakout my skin... "
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Australia,Really nice cleanser,"Love this cleanser. I have sensitive skin, that was prone to breaking out. Since using this cleanser morning and night, the redness in my skin has calmed down and my breakouts have definitely reduced."
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,USA,One of my favourite cleansers,"I was introduced to Alpha-H years ago by a beautician while living in Australia. This brand will always be one of my favourites, they have so many amazing products!

I really like this cleanser. It cleans every speck of dirt and makeup off my skin. As I have combination skin I need a delicate balance of hydration and removing excess oil. This cleanser does the job. I do not feel tight but I feel perfectly balanced and clean. I will repurchase again for sure! 

Cons - it tastes terrible, don't get it in your mouth!"
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Australia,love it ,"Not drying, and cleans the skin really nicely. Need to use a fair bit to get it all over the skin because it doesn’t lather. If you don’t remove your makeup before using this, it won’t remove it for you. "
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Singapore,ALPHA-H Triple Action Cleanser,First time trying the brand. Hope it does not cause any breakout. Travel friendly and the ingredients look promising. So far it makes my skin feel hydrated after cleansing.
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Malaysia,Alpha H Triple Action Cleanser,"No foams, very gentle cleanser. Doesn't strip off skin excess oil. It's suitable for all skin type. May give it a try. Hopes to see result soon, just started using it."
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Australia,fantastic cleanser !,"Love. My skin feels fresh, not raw and has helped me maintain a lack of break outs. I love the consistency and I use every night, it’s great for getting rid of makeup residue. "
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,Malaysia,won’t repurchase,"For me, it’s not a good cleanser. It doesn’t clean my face very well. Used it after make up remover, and still found makeup residues on my toner’s cotton pad after washing my face with this cleanser. The only thing I like about it is that it has no foam, no colour & no fragrance. However, Perhaps I’ll just get myself Cetaphil instead. Won’t repurchase."
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,,New every day cleanser,This is officially my go to cleanser for every day use. It’s really helped clear my skin (along with other Alpha-H products) but is still gentle enough that I haven’t had an adverse effects. Highly recommend. 
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,USA,great basic cleanser,"This cleanser is gentle and light, non pore clogging and balanced"
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,,really nice refreshing cleanser ,Really nice cleanser. Doesn’t have a lot of fragrance or irritants like a lot of cleansers have so you can cleanse your skin without worrying about irritating breakouts or anything like that. Love that it is a non-AHA product so I can use my BHA products without clashing with other acids 
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,USA,Drying for sensitive skin,This cleanser tends to dry out my skin and my skin doesn’t feel soft after using. It is a clear thick cleanser that with my sensitive skin they do not compliment each other. But for someone with more “normal” skin it would do wonders
ALPHA-H-Triple Action Cleanser,USA,Gentle and non-foaming,"I have combo/oily, reactive skin. I can't use foaming cleansers because they dehydrate my skin and have a tendency to break me out. I mostly use this as my second cleanse in the evening and while very gentle, I feel like it does a good job of cleansing my skin without stripping it. It also hasn't caused any breakouts. I have tried using it to remove makeup, which it does work for, but it did sting my eyes a little so I wouldn't really recommend it for that. Overall I think it's a good buy if you have acne-prone skin or any issues with harsh, foaming cleansers."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Pleasantly surprised! Wish I tried Farmacy sooner,"First time to try this brand and product tonight and I am already loving it!
For reference, my skin type is EXTREMELY sensitive and dry, has redness and uneven skin tone. I was a bit skeptical to try this product as I have been using The Ordinary's Squalane cleanser for the past year or so but felt my skin needed a change. Decided to give this brand and product a try and honestly wish that I had done this sooner! Here is my opinion on the product so far:

Farmacy
Clean Bee Ultra Gentle Facial Cleanser

PROS
- little to no scent
- (as product states) does not lather however, is very thick/rich
- removed my makeup completely! 
- no skin irritation
- when I washed it off, left my face feeling squeaky clean without it being dry
--- face was also supple and bouncy
- cruelty-free!

CONS
- quite expensive for the size
- no other cons as of now, but will update if anything comes up as I continue to use this"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Great product. Leaves my face feeling refreshed and I have been using this product for over a year.
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,fav,i’ve been using this cleanser forever absolutely love it
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,underrated product,"I love this facial cleanser. I use it daily after the cleansing balm & it’s amazing. At first it did sting my skin a little, but my skin always reacts that way with new products like this. I also love how long a single bottle will last me. I purchased this bottle last year & I still have enough to last me month. I use one pump daily which I put in my wet hand before applying to my face. I don’t find that it has a specific smell, but maybe that’s because I’m used to it. I will definitely be purchasing another bottle once I finish mine! Awesome product, really underrated in this line."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,"The product itself is nice but the smell is probably the worst smell I've ever smelt from a cleanser, far too overwhelming. Will be returning."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Not bad,"Would be great on normal skin, but seems a tad drying on my sensitive skin. "
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Singapore,cute,Super cute packaging and given that it foams you could probably use it for quite a while. Bought it during a sale and I’d say it’s a worth it purchase. Bottle super solid too. 
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Not hydrating,"My fave gel cleansers are YTTP Kale and Krave Matcha. I've been using this Bee cleanser as a second cleanse after oil for makeup removal. First, it smells like putting honey on my face. Personally, not for me. It quickly evolves to an ivory soap smell. While not stripping like an acid cleanser, this still leaves my combo skin feeling slightly dry and tight."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Not Too Bad,"Its really gentle as the name says it. It lathers easily but maybe because I pump too much. Accidently pump 3 times. So maybe next time will be less than that. I use it together after the cleansing balm. Works well. But maybe this cleanser feels too light for my liking that I felt like my skin is not clean enough. But maybe next time I’ll pair it with my cleansing wipes amd see how it goes. Other than that, it’s good. "
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,a yes from this bee!,"i have a honeybee tattoo so it only felt right that i buy this cleanser, just to see if it was meant to be! and truly, it was. this one lathers a bit, don’t let the advertising fool you. it’s soap! but it doesn’t strip my skin and leaves it feeling as if i’ve just exfoliated. it’s very gentle and easy to work with. the packaging is cute too! love a little yellow cleanser :)"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Perfect Gentle Cleanser,I have combo skin and some foam cleansers can be too harsh on my skin. This leaves my skin feeling clean and very soft. It does a great job in washing away makeup and does not irritate my skin.
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,"Gentle, Incredible Scent","Perfectly gentle, with a good lather and incredible scent.  I have very reactive/sensitive skin, redness-prone skin, and this face wash is gentle enough to use twice a day.  The scent smells wonderful.  I'm definitely obsessed with this cleanser- and highly recommend it."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,"In love with this cleanser. Very gentle, it’s not stripping to my skin. The light honey smell is so nice. I definitely want to repurchase!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Nice product,"Love the honey smell. I do feel like it cleans and tones, though works best after exfoliating. The only reason I give it one less star is because it does sting a little if it gets in your eyes but is gentle on the rest of my face."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,mhmm honey ✨,Extremely sudsy and soft smelling the honey is very apparent but with a soapy after scent. Will be repurchasing because it has been a great cleanser
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,"So I was purchased this on recommendation for my dry skin. I did like how my skin felt after it - it felt oily (in a light nice oily way - not uncomfortable oily), only reason I didn't stick with it was the fragrance - it does have a strong honey fragrance, which I felt bit overwhelming. But great product overall!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,great product awful packaging,i love the product itself but the packaging is just awful. the pump does not lock and about half of this product has leaked out of the bottle. should not be the case for an almost 30 dollar cleanser:/
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,"this is such a gentle cleanser that works amazingly! theres a noticeable difference in my skin texture when i use this product, it really cleans well without being irritating. have been using it for a while (im on my second bottle) and it works a lot better when partnered with a cleansing balm to remove makeup."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,So far so good!,"I can only use gentle cleansers because of my sensitive rosacea skin. I had been using the Fresh Soy cleanser for the past 2 years, but I noticed recently that it left my forehead feeling tight. So, I wanted to try something else, and my research led me to the Farmacy Clean Bee!
Positives: not only is this labeled a gentle cleanser, but it is also targeted for dry skin types, like myself! While i still feel like I definitely need to follow up with moisturizer, it does leave my skin feeling refreshed and clean. Added bonus, this cleanser comes with a pump! I prefer to cleanse in the shower, so this makes it so easy. 
The ONLY slight negative i have noticed, is that i sometimes feel like i have to really rinse it off well. The lather is nice, don’t get me wrong. It doesn’t foam up super crazy, just enough. But one time when i rinsed my face and went to dry it, i still had some lather under my chin and on my neck. No one else has mentioned this though, so this could be an error i am making, because i did use more product that one time. 
While this isn’t a negative for me personally, it is worth noting that if you are sensitive to smells, I would stop at Sephora and smell a tester in person before you buy. It isn’t added fragrance, it is natural, but it can be quite strong. Personally i think this smells better than the Fresh Soy cleanser. 
Overall, this is a nice cleanser, and will definitely be part of my cleansing rotation. I have had this less than a week, so unless this starts to break me out, i will definitely repurchase this!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Not for oily skin,"I needed something to help with dry winter skin but this cleanser broke me out so badly I had to return it. I stopped using it and my skin cleared but when I added it to my AM routine I broke out again with little pimples. My skin still felt a bit dry after using this, so that was interesting seeing how this is a hydrating cleanser. I wanted to love it because the ingredients seemed like a good idea and I love the cleansing balm but Clean Bee wasn't for my skin type."

FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,didn’t see a difference,I didn’t really notice any difference so i don’t think it’s worth the money. Even though i love this brand especially the mask and the face oil
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Too much fragrance ,"The cleanser does what it claims- gentle formulation that won’t make the face feel stripping after the cleansing. However the smell comes off WAY too strong.
"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,If you have dry skin and are looking for a clean product this one is definitely a winner! As the description says it is a gentle cleanser so it will not strip the skin. Since it is has more of a gel consistency just be sure to throughly wash it off. Love using this right after Farmacy’s Green Clean! I’m on my 2nd bottle right now!
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,"3 years, and I still love this face wash!","I am slowly making the shift to green beauty products and I absolutely LOVE this cleanser. Often times, facial washes make my skin dry and tight, but this one leaves my skin feeling soft and supple and ready for a layer of moisturizer. I am on my 3rd bottle now since 2019 and I maybe buy this product twice a year - a little goes a long way! I use less than half a pump. 

When I first started using this product, I had to adjust to it. Something about it would make my eyes very sensitive, and sting slightly - an interesting effervescence, not unlike what a minty cleanser might do... except this isn't minty. Hard to explain. I have since adjusted to that, and otherwise have had no sensitivities to this product. The smell is mild and earthy with notes of honey. It's become a staple in my beauty routine and I love it!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Singapore,oil,"formulations for various skin concerns. ""
I love cleansing oil, and I feel like compared to others I've tried, [this one] much more lightweight and doesn't leave that greasy residue that's hard to get off"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,GOAT Foaming Cleanser,"Does exactly what a good foaming Cleanser should do. Give you that really ""clean"" feeling but doesn't strip your face of moisture and you skin is so soft after using. I have paired it with the honey mask, honey halo cream and honey grail oil and it all works so good together . Truly a god send for dry skin!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,"Love the feeling, hate the smell",I really love this cleanser but the fragrance is soooooo strong i can't get past it :( I will finish the bottle but will not repurchase. I hope they come out with a fragrance free version!
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Too Much Fragrance,"The consistency and texture were great, and it cleansed my face without feeling too stripping. BUT the smell is wayyyyy too strong. I couldn’t get passed that. Returned."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,I love this product. It smells like raw honey and has a great consistency. It doesn't leave my face feeling too dry. My new fave!
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Love!!,"I really like the herbal-ish scent. It’s not overpowering or anything, just fresh! It lightly bubbles up & removes any makeup on your face (even mascara). Leaves my face feeling nice and smooth after using. Having the pump is also so handy. I would really recommend."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,sadly broke me out,"Completely broke me out, I normally do not write reviews but always read them. I do not have sensitive skin, it is typically normal, I use yttp green tea facial cleanser or the truth juice daily cleanser .I wanted to try something new and the smell is great as well as the consistency and packaging.I wanted to like it because the smell and I love the Farmacy cleansing balm but once I switched to the truth juice my skin has not broken out and has looked 10x better. I do like it to shave my legs though until I run out."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Singapore,ok,"Ok, ordinary  facial cleanser .

Doing its job and not causing skin burn outs or dry out .

Overall it’s a cleanser, nothing fancy or amazing, but safe product .

Worth buying during sale seasons 
"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,My Favorite Cleanser,"This has been a serious staple in my skincare routine, I love it so much. I have very sensitive skin, and this gentle cleanser really removes the dirt and makeup out of my pores at the end of the day without being too harsh on my skin. Lather is nice, and a little goes a very long way!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Love,I love it. I use it day and night. I have dry sensitive skin. It smells amazing and my skin feels supple and younger afterwards haha. I love their honey series. 
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Best Cleanser For My Problem Skin!!,"I'm picky about anything that goes on my skin at this point, as most products I've tried will burn my face. Trust me, it can get bad. I've had reactions to tons of cleansers meant for sensitive skin, and this was the first cleanser that didn't burn my face on contact. I love this cleanser already, big fan!!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,fav,"This cleanser is very non drying and suitable for those people who suffer with dry skin after any wash. I am absolutely love this cleanser on how it clean without stripping. Other than Fresh, this one is my favourite cleanser brand so far. The only thing that i can’t bear is the smell. It does smell like honey but a bit overpowering. Overall i’m satisfied. "
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Broke me out,I love how his cleanser smells. I wanted something hydrating for my dry skin but this ended up congesting my skin. I didn't get actual acne but definitely made my skin look bumpy and textured. My partner has clear skin and he experienced the same thing when he used it. I got too lazy to return it and am probably going to have to throw it away.
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Great cleanser,"Where has this been all my life?! Love this cleanser, super gentle. Not drying, which is great during the cold winter months in Wisconsin. My skin feels super clean after use. Light scent of honey which I love. Hasn’t broken me out so this will be a keeper for sure."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,I've been using this product for a few months now and I'm impressed. I have combo skin with a very oily T-zone and was on the hunt for a gentle morning cleanser that wouldn't irritate or dry my skin out and this is that exact product. Love it!
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,"Been a huge fan of Farmacy before it was in Sephora, and I can say this is the best cleanser I've owned and used. I have sensitive, combo, FA skin and have had nothing but positive reactions to it"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,"I have an unhealthy obsession with the honey grail face oil by farmacy so I thought I’d give this a go for a cleanser. I don’t wear much face makeup so I thought this would be great for me as it’s a gentle cleanser and I don’t need much makeup removing power. BUT wow this is really effective. It takes mascara and eye liner off so easily and quickly with just one pump and minimal lather. I had previously tried the whipped green cleanser by this brand and found I had to double cleanse to get my eye makeup completely gone, but this takes my eyeliner and mascara off muuuuch easier. It’s very very gentle though and has such a lovely scent, almost green tea with honey (similar to the oil). My skin feels very clean and I think it settles any irritation or acne I have."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,so clean,Love this face wash. Foams up nicely and has a mild scent. I’m on my 4th bottle!
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,"Ultra gentle like the product claims, but does not remove makeup and my face did not feel refreshed or as clean it should be after cleansing. Personally, I would love a little more lather and maybe a gentle exfoliant incorporated!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Great find!,"I tried this based on Tristan’s suggestion (Metrotown store). I’ve been using it for a few days now and all I can say is “Thank you” This cleanser is so gentle on my skin and my face is soft and clean, no dryness or redness!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,"Horrible product, very drying and not at all good for sensitive skin."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,My Favorite!,"By far my favorite face wash! My skin does best with a lightweight, gentle cleanser, and this is exactly that! This cleanser removed dirt, excess oil, and makeup, yet is still extremely gentle. It has a very light, clean scent to it as well. Must-have!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Very gentle!,"it's super gentle but doesnt leave my face dry after the wash!
repeated purchase!!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,AMAZING,BEST clean cleanser for dry skin and sensitive skin ! foams easy you dont need much and its great for antiaging(in my humble opinion) LOVE THIS !
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,"Was good for a while, I'm on my third bottle of this cleanser and for some reason it's leaving my skin dry and makes my cheeks feel warm after using it. Maybe I'm suddenly sensitive to an ingredient or they've changed the formula, but I'll have to give up what was once my favorite cleanser. I'd say if you already have sensitive skin you may wanna pass on this."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,I love this for my skin! I use it in the morning and night
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,A gentle cleanser that smells nice and great for sensitive skin. It’s the first cleanser I’ve used in years that I like *almost* as much as the Fresh Soy Cleanser. I love the packaging too— so easy to use the pump bottle in the shower! Only downside is it runs out quite quickly.
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,do read,"Smells like honey, love it. The product doesn’t strip off the moisture from your face which is a super plus! But it doesn’t do much besides that. I guess it sticks true to its function of just being a facial wash. Each pump is for a wash which is a great design! "
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Parched Skin,"I love Farmacy products but this cleanser for me was a no-go and I will sadly be returning it. I have combination skin and wanted a gentle cleanser to remove makeup that didn't make my face as dry as the Sahara desert aaaaaand this ain't the one. It dried my face out instantly making it feel tight as soon as I washed it off and I didn't even use very much product. I tried using more and same result. I love that it has a pump for convenience and the ingredients seem great but alas, this was a dud for me."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Amazing cleanser,"I have rather sensitive, combo-oily skin so I really gravitate towards gentler cleansers. I primarily use this cleanser to wash off the cleansing balm in my double cleanse, and I love that it takes everything off without leaving my skin feeling overly stripped. I typically try to avoid washing my face with cleanser in the mornings (I just use lukewarm water), but this cleanser is gentle enough that I'm comfortable using it in the mornings if I feel a little extra greasy or need to wash off an overnight mask."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Not for sensitive/combination skin,"Scent is good but this made my skin dry and irritated. Had break-out with this one, tried using for three days but no progress at all. Not a fan of this product."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Good for sensitive skin,This is the only soap my husband will use for his eczema on his face. He loves it and it soothes his skin. The smell is great too.
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Very drying,"I  am really disappointed in this cleanser. The description and reviews sounded promising and it does do a decent job of removing makeup and daily grime, but for a product with hyaluronic acid and honey which claims to hydrate as it cleanses I have found that my skin has never felt dryer and tighter than after I used this. I gave it a couple weeks to see if my skin was just adjusting to the change in cleanser but have seen no improvements, and have since had to really do some rescue and rehab on my skin to restore the moisture and get rid of the dry, flaky spots cropping up."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,love it!!,Does not dry out my skin and leaves it feeling clean and smooth!
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,will not repurchase,Not my favorite. I bought this on a whim and it dried my face out. It smells great cleans well just not for me.
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Hands down the best cleanser for sensitive and dry skin! I have tried hundreds of products and this is the only one that doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight! My skin is also super clear with this! (However I’ve never really had an issue with acne just the occasional breakout but I really haven’t had any breakouts since using this) I also love the smell! I don’t ever plan to switch from this product
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,SO relaxing!,"Smells AMAZING and fresh, goes on smooth and doesn't over strip or dry out skin. Leaves skin plump and soft. Feels super relaxing. I could wash my face forever. Good for oily skin."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,"My skin dries easily so I am always searching for something that I can use in a two-step cleanse after cleansing oil/balm. I think for most people this would be gentle but my skin as always been prone to dryness so the hunt continues. It does have a very strong honey smell so if you don’t like that smell, avoid this for sure."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,My Holy Grail Cleanser!,"BY FAR MY FAVOURITE CLEANSER! I got the trial size in a kit and it has lasted me MONTHS because you only need to use a small amount. Leaves my face feeling so soft and clean and the natural honey scent is really pleasant. Even better, my acne has definitely improved since using this as well. LOVE LOVE LOVE"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Great addition to my skincare!,"This product is one of my absolute favourites! The honey and hyaluronic acid combination helps calm my skin down of any inflammation or irritation as well as keep my skin hydrated. Having dry skin, my biggest concern is feeling tightness after washing my face and this avoids that at all costs! Great to pair with their honey moisturizer!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Caused dryness,"Left my skin feeling dry and tight. After more uses my skin became flaky and dryer. I ceased use and the dryness cleared up, used it once again to see if the product was actually the issue and the dryness came back. Very stripping. 

For reference my dryness it around my nose, chin and forehead."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Great clean product. I love washing my face after a long day. Doesn’t strip your face and you don’t feel dried or tight this is my third purchase
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Loved It Until I Didn't,"Absolutely loved this product first 4 months or so of using it in a double cleanse routine. Only need one pump, so the bottle could last a really long time, making it much more cost effective in general. Didn't irritate my sensitive skin, even with the light honey fragrance. Well that took a turn about a month ago, and now the fragrance has started to degrade or breakdown, because it is getting insanely intense. Gave myself a two week break, everything was fine. Tried it again, 45 minute sneezing fit. Skin isn't irritated, but eyes are bloodshot and very irritated for hours afterwards. Gave myself another week break, no allergy issues. Took an allergy pill and tried again. EVEN WORSE. Bottle clearly states 12M from opening, but I would give it 3M. There is no way you can use this entire bottle in 3 months unless you try using as a body wash. So if your entire 4 person family uses the same face wash, go for it. Otherwise, hard pass for sensitive skin or people with allergies. Such a disappointment that the shelf life is so off."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,I love it!!,I’ve been using this product for around 3 years and it’s never let me down. It cleans perfectly and I feel refreshed after.
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,this bottle has lasted me such a long time (nearly 6 months!!) i use a small pump and i feel like i definitely get my money’s worth.
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Good for oilier skin,"I use this as a second cleanse after an oil cleanser.  I have combination skin that is sensitive, dry in the winter and oily in the summer.  I can't see using this in the winter time as I worry it would be too drying.  Gives my skin a ""squeeky clean"" feeling...which I don't usually want. But after a sweaty summer day it would probably be refreshing.  Pleasant honey smell and foams up nicely."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,"I love everything from Farmacy! This cleanser is great, it smells like honey and cleans my face well. It is a thinner formula though so I have to use a couple of pumps."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,love love love it,I’ve dry skin on my face and I get pimples on my back from time to time. I’ve used this cleanser on both my face and my back and it works amazing !!! I use it once a day and it doesn’t dry me out unlike the other cleansers I’ve tried before !!!! would repurchase :)
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,I don’t think this product is worth the money. It made my skin feel tight and dry.
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Great gentle cleanser!!,"This does not dry out my already dry skin, only need one pump per use, and a great compliment to my post-washing face products"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Now My Staple,"I have super dry skin, but my t-zone is super oily. I wanted something to clean the day off of my face but not totally strip my face of my natural oils. I use this daily & my skin has seemed to balance out a little more. I use it after oil when removing my makeup & my face feels so clean and fresh but not dried out & crackly like some foaming cleansers have done in the past. There’s also not really any smell & my face isn’t irritated in any way. Love it!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,"My favourite cleanser ever !! I’ve repurchased 4X. 
I have very sensitive, dry skin and this leaves my face feeling clean but not stripped. I also get eczema on my eyes and this doesn’t irritate it at all ! Love it so much."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,great for my skin,I have been using this product for a month now and my skin feels great after cleaning it is not dried out. Obviously every product is different but the entire FARMACY range works wonders for my skin. I am loyal to this brand for life.
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Great Cleanser!,I bought this cleanser as a second step after my Elemis cleansing balm. I love it so much that sometimes I just use it alone to wash my face. I’ve decided now to order the Farmacy cleansing balm instead of reordering my usual Elemis Rose Cleansing Balm!
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Great for sensitive skin,"I have very sensitive skin and was afraid to try a new cleanser but this has been wonderful, no reactions at all!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,I didnt notice much of a difference using this cleanser. On top of that it’s expensive. I’ll stick to old cheaper cleanser for sure.
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,One of my favorite facial cleansers,"I absolutely love this facial cleanser, it’s gentle yet leaves my skin feeling very clean. I have sensitive skin and have had no issues with this. It’s also been good for me when removing makeup. I will purchase again."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,"My favorite cleanser, definitely leaves my skin feeling clean and not dry, I feel like this is the only cleanser that really removes all the oil and makeup on my face."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,I’d buy it again,I love this stuff smells amazing and cleaned my face nice and left it soft and didn’t dry it out
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Smells like honey!,Leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean and the honey scent smells great
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,AWESOME cleanser,"LOVE this facial cleanser. My skin is super sensitive and a lot of cleansers will cause breakouts. This one is gentle on the skin, takes off all of my make up easily, and leaves my skin GLOWING. 10/10 would recommend."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Singapore,love it!,"smells great and lathers on very well. I use it with foreo and i think it helped getting rid of blackheads. doesn't leave skin dry, and a little goes a long way! I'd say do half a pump for each use. it's not too pricey either. there's nothing negative about this product! will repurchase!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,"I hesitated purchasing this due to the price for the amount of product, but I love the brand and I’ve been using it for a month and a half and still have half the bottle. It’s gentle and the scent is mild, but I feel like it cleanses better then the Cetaphil I typically use."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Singapore,love this!,Very nice cleanser! One of the best cleanser. Super gentle and smells like natural honey. It is a watery gel texture and can create foam easily. Recommended to buy. 
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Australia,  FARMACY  Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Great cleanser with amazing compo! 
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,honey ,"This will be new love for facial cleanser. First I like the honey smell, second it has a pump so very convenient to use, thirdly it won’t dry out your skin although it has pretty much bubbles."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Very gentle and nice honey smell cleanser,"I really like this cleanser, which is gentle, it doesn't strip off all the oils and leave my face clean and yet moist.  I like the smell of the cleanser, it is like spreading honey on the face.  Highly recommended."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,"Works great, repurchased several times","My skin is dry and sensitive, and this cleanser is great! It removes all makeup, and doesn't dry out the skin. I don't get that overly dry 'squeaky clean' feeling that some people have mentioned, though my face feels cleansed and it removes makeup well. I think this is definitely better suited to be a summer cleanser, as I definitely prefer something that leaves my skin feeling a little more hydrated for the winter, which is why I deducted a star. That being said, I don't notice any dryness or tightness after I wash my face (but I do always moisturize immediately after in the morning and evening). 

My boyfriend also uses this cleanser and he has sensitive, slightly oilier skin than I do and it still works great for him as well. It doesn't break either of us out. One bottle lasts us months, we use one pump 2-3 times each day. I even try to use less than one full pump if I can. We use it with our foreo luna mini and it distributes beautifully with it. The smell is natural and clean, we love it!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Idk if I’d call it gentle,I use their moisturizer and make up cleansing balm which I really like so figured I’d like this after it being recommended to me. But it drys my skin out so much. I’m combination skin usually and dry in winter. I only wash at night before bed. My skin felt so thirsty after. Very sad because I love this brand.
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,One pump is enough! Lasts Forever,"I’ve had this for several months now and haven’t even used half a bottle. I use it after the green clean makeup melting balm which is a MUST have staple. It foams into a nice lather but isn’t overly drying. After falling in love with the removing balm, I was hesitant to try it due to the price, but it’s worth it because it lasts. I think my face has found its best fit skincare line!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,"Great cleanser! Very gentle on the skin, it leaves my skin super soft. It also has a low pH which is great too. Would definitely recommend!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,Smells Like Honey,"I only need about a pump to wash my face, it lathers well and smells really lovely. I don't find my face getting dry after using it and it does a great job getting me through my morning and evening routine with it's natural scent and gentle foaming cleanse."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,Canada,"Gentle, is what it is.","I've only just gotten into the skincare world and i am always looking to enhance my skincare routine to find products that works well and give me the most. So when i came across this i was weary to try. After some reading and ingredient checking, i decided to try it. It's a good cleanser. It doesn't strip my face and helps breakdown the leftover makeup on my face. IT smells good and washes off nicely. Don't put it around your eyes, as it stung my eye like crazy. Overall i am satisfied with this product."
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,Best cleanser!!,"By far my favorite cleanser I’ve used. It’s gentle, smells nice, and removes majority of my makeup.  I love trying new products but I don’t think I’ll be able to move away from this one!"
FARMACY-Clean Bee Ultra-Gentle Facial Cleanser,USA,best cleanser ive ever used :),my skin is really oily and sensitive so i wanted to find a product that was going to be easy on it but also get me clean. it does not disappoint. i love the smell and the brand itself. cleanser never strips out my skin and feels so gentle
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,works great!,"Love this product. Took 5 minutes to remove dirt and clogged whiteheads. My skin feels very soft and smooth after using this. Pricey but definitely would repurchase cuz this stuff was good af. But a little difficult to find this, only at selected sephora stores."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Singapore,amazing,one of the best and more affordable cleansing oil I have used! I love how it doesn't tug on my skin and really gets make up off. a bottle lasts me 3-4 months and I use it every working day. Great buy!
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Philippines,New favorite makeup remover! ,"I love this product!! Removes makeup quickly and thoroughly. I find that I just have to use one pump and massage gently for a for few seconds for it to remove makeup completely. Prefer to use it for removing makeup, not for everyday double cleansing."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Clean Face ,Been using this product at least 2 years & I have to say it’s fast & easy to remove a full face make up after cleansing wipes or cotton wipes plus double cleansing if you are someone who also makes effort in your make up removal routine for a fresh clean face . At least for me I feel my skin is clean after using it w no make up leftovers . 1 missing star is for the higher price tag 
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Holy Grail of Makeup Removers,"START THE CAR! Seriously. Go buy this product right now. This is a staple in my skincare routine and I use it before anything else. The texture of the oil isn't too thin that it makes a mess, but it's thin enough that it allows your fingers to effortlessly glide over your skin. There's zero tugging, it's scent free, and it effectively removes makeup - on top of being super easy to use!"
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,So sad that this is no longer available! I loved how smoothly it glides over my skin and makes makeup removal a breeze without having to scrub with makeup removal wipes.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,"So fresh and so clean, clean","I love cleansing oils as the first step in my double cleanse. This oil is great and the cool mint leaves me feeling refreshed. Typically I'd avoid mint but don't mind it in this wash-off product. In this case, I love it as part of my nighttime skincare routine, it feels like I'm at the spa."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Favourite,I love this as my first cleanse to remove makeup. It is effective but not harsh on the skin. It helps calm your skin and isn't as hard to wash off as most oil balm cleansers.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Boscia Cleanser,"My review is based on the Boscia Clear Complexion Cleanser.
Can not find it on their page but regardless; love the product.  A small amount goes a long way. Pump bottle is convenient too."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,love.,"Absolutely amazing. Gets off all my makeup and leaves my skin hydrated. It goes onto a dry face, massage it in and then wet face with water and rinse. Smells great, feels clean and not sticky. Love it so much. Would recommend. I follow up with a great facial oil and my cystic acne has disappeared."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,"I purchased this a while ago, and used it, and found that it made my skin very bumpy and dry! I put it under my sink and tried to give it another try recently and unfortunately, I had the same results. Would not recommend."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,"Removes my eye makeup, but blurs vision","I’m a fan of this! I don’t like super thick oil cleansers to remove makeup, so I enjoy that this one is a little thinner/slipperier like a gel cleanser. I still get a bit of blurry vision (as I’ve found with other oil cleansers) so 4 stars for that. I’ll be using this and sometimes the makeup eraser (for heavier eye makeup) to avoid the blurry vision problem"
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,10/10 recommend,Great oil cleanser. Hydrating. Cooling effect was very refreshing. Small bottle size fit well in my drawer.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,NOT A BIG FAN,"Do not like the smell. Does not take off makeup , if anything it spreads it across your face and the water doesn’t rinse it off. 
You can find better for the price"
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,the best!!,"actually cooling, takes off make-up quickly but instantly - great cleanser"
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,"I wouldn't recommend this if you have sensitive skin, it smells great and feels great while you use it but it gave me acne on my jaw."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,For someone who has big pores and lots of blackheads in my t-zone this is the only kind of face oil I can put on my face that doesn’t cause more blackheads. I wouldn’t use it as a by itself cleanser as I need something stronger for my skin type but this is a amazing first step cleanse or makeup remover for oily/acne prone skin.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,My HG product.,"I've tried several cleansing oils and always find myself coming back to this one. Without any water, massage this over your face and then add some water to your fingertips to create a lather. It takes everything off effortlessly without leaving an oily residue or drying my skin out. Also, most cleansing oils break me out but this one doesn't."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE,I love this product! It takes of my makeup without stripping my skin barrier. I use this as the first step to the double cleanse - an oil cleanser for the first step to take off makeup and impurities. I feel clean and ready for my next cleanser (water-based cleanser). I had my mom and sister try this product and they both bought one for themselves! They switched from using makeup wipes to using this as part of their double cleanse. Saving the environment and your skin!
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Great for double cleansing! Really gets that gunk off your face. I have noticed that I’m not as oily as I usually am ever since using this.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,The best cleanser out there,"Up until about four years ago, I worked in the skincare industry. Throughout all my time in it (and even since then), I have tried different cleansers - but I always come back to this one. I have tried so many different cleansers out there, but this has become my holy grail. I recommend it to everyone! Great for dry, dehydrated, acne prone (unless it is bacteria or hormonal based acne), sensitive and mature skin. Removes makeup like a charm, and leaves no residue behind. I LOVE IT!"
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,melts everything off your face!,"I love this cleansing oil. It gets EVERYTHING off my face. I typically use a gentle cleanser afterward and finish with micellar water but if I am lazy and don’t cleanse, the cotton round I use to apply micellar water comes off completely clean. Great product. 

I saw a few reviews about a janky pump with this oil. I have purchased it twice and second time the pump didn’t work at all. Replaced it in store for a new bottle which works great. 

Highly recommend."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,"Highly recommend! I have tried so many different brands of makeup wipe removers, balms and oils and this is hands down the best! My makeup has never came off so easy before!"
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,It’s okay... It leaves oily residue after rinsing and raccoon eyes from the left over mascara. I have yet to find a clean product that works as good as the Physicians Formula Green Tea cleansing balm. I may be trying the farmacy green clean cleansing balm again.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,"Such an amazing product and works very well at taking off makeup, even waterproof. It doesn’t leave any residue on my face and washes off with just water. only bad thing I have to say is that the pump on this bottle is so horrible and cheap. ive gone through 2 bottles so far and BOTH have had issues with the pump getting stuck and not working."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,It works.,"I really like this oil as a first step in cleansing. I wear lots of makeup and it does a good job removing it. It is quite oily so you definitely need to use a cleanser afterwards, but I feel my face is so much cleaner after doing both. I know my makeup is all gone and my skin is actually clean after a regular cleanser as step 2. I bought this last fall as I get drier skin in winter months, and I still have almost half the bottle left (it’s now October) - a little goes a long way."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Worst Face Wash I've Tried,"I had high hopes for this face wash based on the description, but I absolutely hated it. It didn't do a good job of removing my makeup, and it left a horrible oily residue on my skin. It also did not smell very good. I gave it a good try, but ended up tossing it after using it for a week."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Calmed down my sensitive face.,"I live in NY and my skin hates the winter time. I get dry and flaky between my eyebrows and near my nose and cheeks which is my sensitive spot. I normally use Belief cleanser and I love it. However, for a week I was trying different foundations because I have a slight tan, and my skin was a little irritated and somewhat red. I ran out of belief cleanser and remembered I purchased Boscia cool cleansing oil travel size for vacay. I used it for few days and noticed my skin is not irritated and the redness calmed down. It is fall now and it is great. I don't know by the time it gets colder if it will still make my face feel that way. FYI I don't get massive redness. Pink and irritated."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Does the job,"I wanted to try this after the farmacy one as it has a pump! It does the job but way harder to wash off comparing to farmacy... I have to keep massaging with warm water then rinse off whatever I can. After that, use cleanser to take the rest off."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,"Have not been able to find a replacement that is this clean, gentle and effective!"
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Helps save cleanser .,"I will only use THIS cleansing oil. First of all, double cleansing has totally helped clear my acne. This oil is so light, that you don’t have to use tons more cleanser to remove it."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,so soft,This stuff makes my skin soooooooo soft I absolutely love it. It’s so much less drying than a cleanser with soap.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,nope,"I don't understand all these great reviews, there was no cooling effect and it left behind make up. I love cleansing oils and was looking for a cheaper alternative to tatcha but this was not it. save ur money."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,"Doesn’t remove all my make up, especially from eyes. To oily, makes me want to use another cleanser after using this one. Didn’t like at all. Maybe good for super dry skin though but didn’t work out for me."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Must buy makeup remover,"I love this product!  I use it to remove my mineral makeup and then a cleanser to remove any remaining dirt/grime on my skin.  This combination has improved my skin immensely, and I love this product"
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,does not remove your makeup,"I have been double cleansing for a while now and this is the worst makeup removing oil i have tried yet! The product smells good, you feel like you are at the spa but it stops there ! This leaves behind a LOT of foundation on my skin so much so that i have to remove it with micellar water ! If you are looking for a great one others that are wayyyy better are : l'occitane, biossance and caudalie."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,The product itself seems ok (I find makeup still to be residual afterwards). The pump is the issue for me. I’ve had two pumps that are faulty. They do not pump. Like others said when the packaging changed this became an issue. I wouldn’t buy again just based on that. If you get a pump that works I guess you’re lucky.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Not Worth It,"Honestly, I wanted to love this product since it's clean, vegan, and cruelty free but this formula just didn't cut it for me. It's more watery than oil and it didn't take off all my makeup. I prefer Clinque, ,Take the Day Off cleansing balm."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Pump broke on first use.  Product was terrible.  I usually have good luck with Boscia but this is a lemon.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,better than Precleanse,I used Precleanse by Dermalogica for years as a makeup remover and while it worked well and smelled SO good it never completely removed my Lancôme Monsieur Big mascara. This does! Effortlessly! I don’t know what the difference is but I really don’t care because I don’t have mascara smudges on my pillows anymore :)
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,It does a great job to remove my makeup even waterproof makeup and most importantly I found this product is very gentle for eyes area. I already finished 2 bottles and also it left my skin soft!
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Gets ALL Makeup Off,This my favourite cleanser! It's gentle on sensitive skin and removes waterproof mascara
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,"Love that it melts away my makeup with a nice tingling
 feeling. Make to follow instructions and add a splash of water after you have already rubbed it on your face."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Bad packaging,Love this product but the pump is TERRIBLE! When I pump it down it sticks and does not come out! Love the product but I will try another cleaning oil because of this
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,"I really enjoy this cleanser! I use it as my first step in my double cleansing routine at night only. It does have a cooling effect which can be harsh on the eyes but it’s no worse then getting another cleanser in you eyes. It definitely works to remove all your makeup. One to two pumps, depending on how much makeup you’re taking off."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,"I really like this product! Removes all my face makeup easily (I use a different product for my eye makeup) & doesn’t leave any residue behind. I don’t feel a cooling sensation when I use it but it does feel really nice on the skin. It also did not cause any cystic acne flare ups, which oils tend to sometimes cause for me. Had to take a star off because the component really sucks."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,works great,I've struggled to find a good makeup cleanser and this stuff smells great and works awesome. I will be buying again.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,This has worked great for me! I have a double cleanse routine. I use this first to remove all my makeup then I follow up with the Caudalie purifying gel cleanser to really clean my skin. This combo has worked wonders for my skin. I’m deducting one star because I need to use a bit more of this than compared to other cleansing oils I’ve used in the past.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Broke me out,"This cleanser broke me out in horrible cystic acne. It was the only new thing I added to my routine and I tried it on 2 different occasions to double check. It does remove makeup and sunscreen very well though, just would not recommend for anyone who has acne prone skin."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Works Great!,This works wonderfully at breaking up my makeup and doesn't cause breakouts.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Holy grail makeup remover!,"This stuff is the best! It totally removes my full face of make-up, doesn't sting or do anything weird to my eyes, and easily comes off. I personally find similar products that come as a solid, like the DE or Farmacy, awkward to use. I find it best to apply one pump to dry skin, really thoroughly rub all over my face, then wipe off with a wet wash cloth. I follow it up with the REN Cleansing Milk and my skin feels super clean and soothed."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,can’t live without it,"I’ve been using this for about 5 years and I can not live without it! It’s the last step in my nightly skincare routine. I like to use it right after I get out of bed in the morning to give my skin a boost of glow and hydration- the scent also helps to wake me up. I like using it as a primer for makeup, and in the winter I use it to set my makeup after I’ve put it on. It makes my skin more even, dewy but not oily, and has gotten rid of any & all flaky dry patches I used to have."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,amazing,Started using boscia this year & I have oily skin & this doesn’t make my skin any Oiler it helps a lot with make up & dirt that you get from the day it’s amazing.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,new packaging,"love the juice but the new packaging is terrible. the pump does not work-at all. it is not just a one time glitch, ive had two bottles now that the pump does not work at all. for both bottles ive unscrewed the top and end up pouring product into my hands. i will not repurchase."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Love it,"It works well removing all my sunscreen and makeup, I will definitely be repurchasing!"
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,"I’ve used this product for over a year. I previously used the charcoal makeup melter that is no longer made. I have to say the makeup melter was better but this is a close second. I use a cleanser afterward to really get off any bits of oils or makeup and my skin is happy. I find most other removers leave a layer and I break out, so I look for something like this that really removes it all."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,My favorite for double cleansing!,"I had gotten the mini-size as a gift and I bought the full size after I used it up because it's a really good cleanser for my double-cleansing routine. I think a little goes a long way and it takes off my makeup really well. I can't speak to the ""cooling"" part of the product name but I definitely think if you're debating this cleanser, the $10 mini is a good trial. It lasted me so long since I only needed a half pump for my entire face."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,this is a great cleanser!,"This is a really solid oil based cleanser! I use this as a part of a double cleanse routine after removing the visible layer of make up with some micellar water and a make up remover wipe. It works really well on getting rid of the make up and dirt that gets left behind. It doesn’t break me out and my skin doesn’t feel stripped after rinsing. I don’t know how well it would work on its own as a remover, but as part of my routine it’s been a great addition!"
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,"great product, terrible new packaging",This is one of my longtime favorite products. I use it to remove my eye makeup prior to washing my face every night. I noticed with my most recent purchase that they had changed the packaging and the pump top is now awful! It’s difficult to turn so it opens and even then tends to stick or not work. It’s gotten to the point now (not even halfway through the bottle) that I just unscrew it and pour some into my hand. I’m probably going to buy some sort of generic bottle to pour it into. Really hope they’ll fix the packaging before I buy again!
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Takes everything off,I've consistently used this makeup removing oil for the past few years and have yet to find anything that removes even the most stubborn of waterproof mascara. This is by far the best makeup removing oil I've found and my skin feels unbelievably soft and smooth after.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Save Your Money; This doesn't Work,"Goodness I hate this product. I brought this home because my favorite cleansing balm was sold out. The first night I used it, I had light makeup on and the ilia masacara, a mascara that has a history of melting off easily. I put several pumps of this all over my face, it had a uncomfortable and not needed cooling sensation.  After rinsing, I noticed something awful, IT DIDN'T REMOVE MY MASACARA! If I wear a full face of makeup this cleansing oil will not remove it. I pay my face dry after a really good second cleanse and makeup is left behind, as well as a film on my face.

and if you think this is because I'm not leaving it on long enough or massaging it into my skin. I left the oil on for 5min massaging the whole time and still, an oily residue on my face and makeup left on the towel after the best  water based cleanser on the planet.

Save your money"
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,"I use this first before my cleanser every am and pm. Very nice product that works well! Even without makeup on, it really helps to remove the oil from my skin (oily skin type). Will continue to purchase!"
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,"GREAT CLEANSER, TERRIBLE PACKAGING","great cleansing oil! It takes off my makeup well and is also great for oil bc leading in general if that’s what you’re into. However, the packaging is TERRIBLE!!! The pump gets stuck and I have to unscrew the cap and pour the oil into my hand. Besides that, it gets the job done."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,It’s Ok,"It does take off my makeup but some effort is still necessary. I have to rub my eyes a bit to get the eyeliner off, but then again my eyeliner is liquid. It might work better with pencil? I’m not exactly sure how effective it is at removing sunscreen since I can’t see it. I’m just glad it didn’t break me out. I’d recommend it for light makeup or skincare removal."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Does the Job,"Really enjoy this cleansing oil. Great first step in my cleansing routine to help remove all my makeup, and most importantly does not irritate my eyes. Also don't mind the fragrance as it's a rinse-off product."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Overall solid product,"This is a great cleansing oil. It's not irritating around the eyes and face in general, and I find it gets off most of my makeup before I do a second cleanse. I highly recommend it."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,AMAZING!,Wow the first cleansing oil that does not require much work to remove mascara and eye makeup.  The makeup seriously just melts away with very little work.  Finally!  This is amazing!
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,"Good Product, Bad Packaging","Love the product, but i don't like the new packaging. I don't know if this is an issue with all the new bottles, but the pump gets stuck when it's pushed down. It's really annoying and makes me not want use it. Never had this issue with the old bottles."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,"""Clean"" Product that Effectively Removes Make-Up","This product satisfies all the criteria I was looking for in a cleanser:  (1) it is ""Clean;"" (2) it effectively removes my makeup; (3) I don't need to use another cleanser; and (4) it doesn't sting my eyes.  Highly recommend."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,cooling effect makes my eyes burn,"Gets all the make up off, and I really like the cooling feeling on my skin. If I get too much in my eyes it starts to burn."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Worth it!,Love this! It takes off my waterproof makeup super easily and doesn’t dry my skin out like lots of cleansers do. I highly recommend trying it!
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,"Great, easy, effective product","So my sensitive skin has had historically negative issues with ‘new to me skin’ care products. 
However, this Boscia product is excellent, so far:). I agree w/ the the other reviewers that it doesn’t have that cooling feeling, which I’m so glad about. My extremely sensitive skin hasn’t reacted and it easily clears makeup on my entire face, including my ultra sensitive eye area with ease. Excellent product. I know this might sound a little gross, but I could feel my whiteheads clearing off my skin. I use this in combo w/ at home ole Hendrickson vitamin c banana bright eye cream, belief face jelly cleanser, a retinol product and linage in the evening, and a c serum w/ a supergoop sunscreen."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,So worth it! Completely remove everything.,Completely replaced my makeup wipes and does the job 10X  better. I use this to remove all my makeup - just one pump to remove everything including waterproof mascara. Then I follow up with a hydrating cleanser to double cleanse.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,"Only cleansing oil that has been able to fully remove my daily spf. A little goes a long way, bottle lasts forever, great value for price point"
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,"Excellent, even for my acne-prone skin","Works REALLY well for removing tough makeup, especially eye makeup. After I use this, nothing is left on my face, no residue, nothing. I even used this when I had acne, before I started accutane and it never made me break out. I would have given 5 stars, but the only thing is, when I use it on my eyes, it makes my eyes cloudy and I have to spend extra time washing out my eyes. I would give this 4.5 stars for that reason only. Been using this product for about 4 years now."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Absolutely shook,"I was so shocked the first time I used this as a makeup remover/cleanser! It literally MELTED the makeup off my face with none left behind, I used my toner immediately after cleansing and there was 0 makeup on the cotton pad afterwards. I was a little nervous about breakouts using a cleansing oil as I have oily/combination acne prone skin but so far it hasn’t caused any blemishes and doesn’t dry out my skin or leave it feeling oily after either."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Very decent!,"Was looking for an alternative to my favourite cleansing oil, which is Dermalogica Pre-cleanse. This one isn't exactly cheap, but much more affordable in comparison. It was effective in taking off sunscreen and makeup, and it's good that it's unscented, but one star off because the name of the product made me think it has some kind of cooling effect and it doesn't. (Makes sense, since people would probably be using it close to their eyes, but still!)"
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,This product does a great job of getting the makeup off. It doesn’t always spread easily in the beginning but it doesn’t leave any makeup behind
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Great Stuff!,Love this stuff!!! Great for dry skin. Removes make-up easily and leaves your face nice and soft.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Can't use it on my eyes so it's useless,"It smells good and feels nice on the skin... But I can't use it on my eyes. It feels terrible, it's like I can't rinse it off and it leaves a gooey/greasy film on my eyeball. Leaves my eyes sooooo irritated. Like seriously what is the point of a makeup remover if you can't use it on your eyes...  I definitely don't recommend it and sadly I will have to find a new makeup remover."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Must Have!,I cannot live without this stuff! I am obsessed and won’t use anything else to remove my makeup. It’s lightweight on the skin even though it is an oil and doesn’t leave my skin feeling oily or greasy. Removed even the most stubborn makeup including waterproof. You won’t be sorry for this buy!
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,First Cleansing Oil,My first experience with a cleansing oil and it has been great. I use this to take my makeup off and it works wonderful and feels great too. You only need one pump for a full face of makeup so it goes a long way. I would recommend as a starter if you're unsure what cleansing oil to buy
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,New formula that clogs pores,"I used to buy this product all the time. Recently, they have changed the formula and all it does is clog my pores and make me break out. Will never buy again."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Good effective oil cleanser,"This oil cleanser has been a staple in my double cleansing routine. Been making multiple purchases over the years. It removes makeup and sunscreen effectively. Ingredient list meet my needs, without dimethicone, fragrances, essential oils. Holding one star back because recently this cleanser has a change in packaging - it starts to get difficult to pump out the oil cleanser smoothly as the new pump head doesn't fit with the pump tube completely and the new pump tube is too thin."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,"This is the best makeup remover I have ever used I’ve been using this for probably three years now and anything else I try, I always come back to this one. It takes off my water proof mascara so effortlessly and so fast! I love that I don’t always have to use a cleanser after as well I would highly highly recommend"
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Would recommend even for oily skin!,"Personally did not buy this the first times I used it, as my cousin who I lived with at the time worked at sephora and we shared a bathroom so I was always just testing out her things as she brought it home, however I found that this, along with the purity cleanser, are my FAVOURiTE makeup removers. I gave up makeup wipes a long time ago cause I found them way too abrasive, insufficient and wasteful. With this though, even with oily skin it perfectly gets off all my makeup and I love using it with a double cleanse! Makes me feel way better than just using wipes or micellar water. Would definitely recommend if you want to invest in a good cleansing oil."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Avoid,"I heard so many good things about this product so I was super excited to try it. Not only did this product not really take off my makeup very well, it left me with bumps around my jawline. It was the only new thing I had introduced into my skincare routine. I will be returning it!"
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,love love loveeeee,"So awesome and really breaks down all my makeup, even eyelash glue. Doesn’t burn my eyes and glides onto the skin like a dream. Boscia is one of my all time favorite brands. Never disappoints."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Works on waterproof mascara!,"Honestly, I can't believe how great this stuff works! I always use waterproof liquid eyeliner and waterproof mascara and this actually removes it. I don't have to use waterproof make-up remover anymore. I will say that I was a bit skeptical at first since I have oily skin, but it doesn't leave my skin oily at all after washing it off. I found my new favorite cleanser/makeup remover."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,"Favorite oil cleanser, will repurchase","Previously I tried Clinique's Take the Day Off and DHC's oil cleanser, and I much prefer this.  I did a lot of research on oil cleansers and liked the ingredients in this one. I love the smell of the product, the bottle was bigger than I expected, and it works well as a first cleanser. I've stopped searching for a new oil cleanser, I'll be using this from now on."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Balances Out Oily Skin,"This has become a staple in my skincare routine. I have oily skin and it seems to balance it out. I double cleanse with it, first using to remove my makeup and then simply to cleanse the face afterwards. I switched to this after using purity for years. Purity began to dry me out and ultimately made me more oily. Definitely give this a try if you’re on the fence."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,New Favourite Product,I received a sample of this at Sephora and I really liked the product. I have purchased it three times since my initial sample and I think it makes a difference in my skin. I like the way the product glides on and it leaves my skin feeling soft. One of my new favourites.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Very gentle and it does melt your make up off with no problem! Even took off mascara. I do recommend using a make up wipe beforehand. But i tried it without using a makeup wipe as well and still works! I just prefer using a wipe for cleaner results.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Super easy to use. Super easy to work into your skin care routine. Melts basically everything off your face and made my skin feel amazing and so soft using it.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,"My absolute holy grail make up removing cleanser!!! It melts away all my make up including mascara so easily. I do only use this product as a make up remover, I have to use a different cleanser to double cleanse my face as this product just melts off make up! I believe I’m on my 4th bottle now."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Canada,Melts makeup!,"Prior to purchasing this product, I used a makeup remover for my eyes and then let my normal face-wash take care of the rest. Ladies, this stuff MELTS your makeup (including your eye makeup!)."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,No longer need to scrub away mineral sunscreen,"I have sensitive, fair skin that requires use of mineral sunscreen. It is harder to remove with water-based cleansers than it is to wash off mineral makeup. I had never heard of the double-cleanse method before 2018 when I received this item in a sample kit. It blew my mind how effective this product is in melting away the sunscreen or any makeup product in a smooth motion. It rinses away cleanly so I can follow with a water-based cleanser and am left super clean and not tight. Also surprising is that I did not have any reaction to the product although it has fragrance and menthol (hence the cooling effect)."
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,Love this product! Got it as a sample & have been using ever since...not harsh & cooling feel. Removes ALL of your makeup.
BOSCIA-MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil,USA,Melt your makeup,This is my go to product! I’ve always struggled finding the best way to remove my make up w/out tugging or drying my skin out and this is my solution. It melts off your make up and keeps your skin feeling cool and moisturized. It’s a perfect way to remove your make up so you can begin to wash your face.

TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Australia,Mrs ,This is a great cleanser to remove makeup. It is refreshing and gentle on the skin. Love that it has a pump. It lasts a long time. I cleanse twice with this and I’m happy with the removal of my makeup. 
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Singapore,Not as great but ok,This is an okay makeup removing cleanser but it didn’t remove all my makeup though. I had to separately use a makeup remover wipe to thoroughly cleanse my skin. It was a double-work for me. Will not repurchase. 
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Singapore,hydrating face wash,"tbh i got this on a sale and didn't have high expectations, but it's such a hydrating face wash! i've oily combination hormonal acne prone skin, and the first time i used this i thought i wasn't washing the cleanser off properly because my face felt so smooth. but i've come to appreciate how hydrating it is- none of the tight itchy dry feeling!!"

TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,Really good!!!,This product is AMAZING! It takes off makeup so well and leaves your faces feeling clean. It also makes your skin very soft. There is a slight smell of algae when I use it but that’s just it’s ingredients and it isn’t a smell that sticks.
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,Good buy quality-price,"This cleansing gel is good: clean and remove make-up at once. Very light smell similar to La Neige scent ( lemongrass) .But because y skin is very dry, I would recommend something more milky during cold weather, Quality-price, certainly a good buy. I do recommend it."

TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 50ml (Travel Size),I thought this was weird at first because it feels like it doesnt wash off.

TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,Doesn't cleanse,"I don't really get buying this kind of skincare or cleansers that don't do the job. This one just feels like a slimy gel. it does not lather or cleanse or do anything it is supposed to do. it obviously does not even remove makeup.
I bought it in the mini kit, and won't be repurchasing again."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Singapore,stings my eyes ,This is a oil remover that in theory should remove eye makeup. But unfortunately it stings my eyes like crazy. It does remove the make up tho after a great deal of pain. I would absolutely not recommend this. 
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,oily and slimy,I got this in a sampler. It seems like a gel at first but it feels more like an oil that never washes off. You're left with a greasy film on your face and after using it only twice it caused a breakout.

TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,"Love this product, miss the old packaging!!!","This cleanser is amazing - washes off all of my makeup better than cleansers that I’ve tried that are triple the price.  Leaves my skin feeling super clean.  But please Tarte, switch back to your old packaging/Rainforest of the Sea marketing… these new bottles are so dull and boring, totally take away from the appeal the originals had.  Such a shame"

"
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Singapore,Doesn’t remove waterproof makeup,"Bought this after reading the good reviews, but regretted after using it. It is unable to remove the waterproof makeup thoroughly. After using this product, I tried using my usual makeup remover with a cotton pad to see if there’s any residue left on my face. Disappointed to see that there’s still makeup appearing on the cotton pad. "
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Malaysia,Best at removing make up,for travel I don't need to bring another make up remover since it can cleans my face and not drying. Other than that I don't see any superior difference. 
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Australia,Good product but expensive ,"This tarte gel cleanser does what it claims. It removes my makeup with just light rubbing and leaves does not  dry my skin like other cleansers. But I would have to say for the amount of product, the price is a bit steep. There are other gel cleanser at lower price.
"

TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Malaysia,great,"I love how it melt my make up, very easy to use and doesnt sting your eyes! Bought the travel one hence i dont get exact as per picture. The only downside is it dries your skin a bit"
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 150ml,"Don’t let the name fool you, this is a gentle cleanser. This is a wonderful gel cleanser. It cleans your face well with a nice lather but you don’t feel stripped AT ALL afterward. It just feels well balanced. Nothing special to it, no crazy claims, but it’s a well formulated cleanser that won’t strip you dry."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,no,Waste of money! Feels like it never washes off the face.
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,"cleansed, tight + hydrated","A 'Clean at Sephora' product with a light scent that leaves your skin feeling cleansed, tight and hydrated. Gently removes makeup. Your skin will thank you!"
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,"Very harsh, exacerbated my eczema","I have primarily dry skin, and certain harsh products also give me eczema breakouts around my eyes. This is one of those products. It also leaves my skin feeling uncomfortably tight and dry after using."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,Gave me the worst break outs,Do not recommend if you have oily or combo skin. I never have gotten big break outs until i used this product. It made my skin the worst its ever been. You can feel oils of the product being left on the skin after it’s washed off. I would only use this product to take makeup off and would definitely need to do another cleanse with a different product afterwards.
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 150ml,Great gentle cleanser and makeup remover. Not too harsh. Perfect for sensitive skin.
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 150ml,"I don’t have “holy grails” and I don’t give 5 starts. But this is my holy grail cleanser!! Been using it for around 4 years now and it’s the only cleanser that is gentle enough to use on my sensitive/combo skin. Very minimal scent, always removes all my makeup (sometimes have to double cleanse), and never leaves my skin feeling uncomfortable. I was nervous when they changed the name and packaging that they also changed the formula but it seems to be unchanged. Highly recommend."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 150ml,"Helped my skin a lot in the mask vs. make up struggle that has been 2020/2021. Nice smell, lasts a long time and has really helped to clear my skin"
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,Not a good 'cleanser',"My skin feels far from clean with thus facewash. It also feels like there's a thin slimy layer left after it's rinsed off. The smell of this wash is not appealing in any way, it really doesn't smell good at all. I thought it would be a lot better than what it is with all of these reviews."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 50ml (Travel Size),By far my favorite face wash.I will be rebuying it.I habe senstive skin so it didnt make me break out.

TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Australia,like ,It’s a pretty tough cleanser on the skin so if sensitive I wouldn’t recommend and would choose something else.. but it works well and removes makeup quite easily 
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Australia,Not for me ,"It was a good cleanser and removed makeup really well, particularly mascara but I really wasn’t a fan of the smell! I gave it to my Mum and she loved it and the smell didn’t bother her! "
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Malaysia,different,i ordered the travel saiz one but th packaging is not the same like in the picture. it looks cheap bottle and not like the one in catalog. the writing is so pale that i cannot even read it. I want refund!!!
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Australia,Best Cleanser,I have tried hundreds of different cleansers yet this cleanser by far is the best one I have ever tried. It cleanses the skin so well yet doesn't leave the skin dry or stripped off. If anything it adds abit of hydration. 
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 50ml (Travel Size),"I was using the ordinary squalene cleanser but saw this one and wanted to give it a try because I really like Tarte! I bought the mini size of this cleanser because I couldn't find the full size, but I wish I could've because it's awesome! Smells great, lathers nicely so a little goes a long way to take off all my makeup - like 2 or 3 small pumps, so the mini should last me a while! I hope they have the full size back soon because I will be repurchasing!"
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,versatile product,"I tried their sample size of this and since it’s thick and concentrated, I was able to use the tiny sample bottle for long time! I’m very pleased! Now I’m deciding to buy the bigger one cause first, isn’t harsh at all. It removes even the hardest to remove eyeliner makeup on my jacket that I accidentally put on, really makes me think this is the best makeup remover and, one time I was in a trip and forgot to bring a cleanser, I thought this is only a makeup remover but I read it’s also a cleanser! I’m really amazed by this  product. It also smells really good! I love it! It’s a must purchase! Espc when you’re travelling and don’t wanna bring add up excrss makeup remover and cleanser products! Cause this is a 2-1!"
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Australia,love it,"Suuuuper nice texture. Very gentle on the skin, a double cleanse it’s definitely required. The smell is not overpowering and a little goes a long way. I have been using this for a while now and will keep repurchasing "
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,New Zealand,Not too bad but the smell,It's easy to use and easy to clean. But it has an unpleasant smell and tends to give the skin a tingly sensation if not rinse in time. I dont think I will purchase it again just for the smell...
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 150ml,"I don’t have a lot of “holy grail” products, but this cleanser has had me on edge since I tried the sample and knew: This is perfect for my skin. The name at that time was Rainforest of the Sea Deep Dive Cleansing Gel, and I knew it was too crazy to stay the same. I just hoped it could be rebranded but not reformulated.

Do we have the same skin? Maybe, maybe not. I’m intensely fair, oily nose, dry forehead with texture, beginning to age (I’m 38). I find it adequately removes KVD tattoo eyeliner and remnants of eye lash glue, and plumps my skin.

The residue? Not quite a residue for me. It’s more like a Dove nutrium effect - there is an emollient that replaces the natural oils it washed away. Like a 2 for one. If I skip moisturizer, I don’t have a painfully tight and flaking face. I would say, if you use Dove body washes and understand what I mean, you will probably like this feeling too. My skin looks smoother, younger, plump.

For me, it replaced Philosophy’s Purity. Bested it. I almost never have breakouts with this formula, and I attribute that to the way the cleaner keeps the moisture balance."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,New Zealand,Great product ,"This product is good in a double cleanse. For example, using miscellar water to start to clean your make up like eye makeup up etc... then come in with this cleanser to get the rest off. The bottle looks very plain compared to the sample I got however it’s whats inside that matters "
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 50ml (Travel Size),Great gentle but powerful cleanser and makeup remover. Not harsh at all.
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Australia,best cleanser ,"Have been using this for 2 years and never looked back. It cleans well, doesn’t dry out skin, and doesn’t irritate - the perfect product.
Have tried other high end brands and keep coming back to this, it’s the most gentle effective cleanser out there :) 
"
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,"Amazing, will keep purchasing",Absolutely love this cleanser.  It is gentle for my sensitive skin and is effective at removing makeup.  I also found my acne cleared up.  This product is not drying and does not leave the skin feeling stripped.
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,great gentle makeup remover,Gently removes makeup other cleansers do nothing against and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I don’t have to scrub roughly to get it off.
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,Helped my acne!!,"I really like this! I have acne prone skin and I’ll be 35 in a few months. I tried this and it really helped my skin. My Mom and niece said it does leave a film on their face,  but I think it just needs to dry good. For some reason this sells out pretty fast and I can never get it when I remember I want it. I have moved on to a different face wash, but this is most definitely worth a try!!!"
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 150ml,My favorite face wash! Gentle and hydrating for my sensitive dry skin.

TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,"Love product, not sure about new label",Love it. Bought as a replacement. The new art looks a little cheap tho
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 150ml,"This cleanser has a gel like feel. Left my skin dry. It did clean my skin, but not worth the price."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 150ml,"This is a good cleanser, I like how simple it is with some exfoliating beads, the only thing I dislike is the scent it is very strong."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Singapore,hydrating with a healthy oil infused feeling,"As with title, it doesnt dry skin at all, in fact it gives this super hydrating feeling close to an oil based serum application some how. A little goes a long way as well. Tried the sample initially, and loved it a ton so bought the full sized product. If youre looking for a squeaky clean cleanser, this is definitely not it, might take awhile to get used to the final feeling. Used as the 2nd cleanser for double cleansing on nights after washing off a whole day's make up."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Singapore,its ok but won't repurchase,I find that's it's kind of like regular cleanser. too expensive and too little for daily use. won't be repurchasing it since it's not really cheap too....
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Singapore,fuss free cleansing gel,"does what it's meant to do. 2 to 3 pumps is good, just lather it until it foams up before massaging all over the face. it cleans well but I've had times where it felt a little drying afterwards so I'm not sure if it's the product or just my skin."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,Not for oily skin,"I have oily skin and this cleanser made things worse. It leaves an oil on your skin when your rinsing it off and my face was shiny and oily 2 hours after washing my face. I also do NOT have acne prone skin and it made me breakout like crazy, probably because it clogged my pores so much."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 50ml (Travel Size),I've been using this cleaner for a few years now and it's my fav.  Leaves my skin refreshed and clean. Has a nice scent and easy to use.

TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,New Zealand,love this,"Feels so nice on the skin and leaves me feeling refreshed after using it. Will (and have) recommended this to friends. Pleasant smell, not too strong "
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,Very smooth - almost like an oil,This cleanser is so nice. It removes makeup (medium amount) and daily debris with simple massage and gentle circular motion and warm wash cloth to rinse. Very little fragrance. Toner pad is clear after use. This is truly a lovely remover/cleanser. Very happy to have found it. The gel for me feels cleaner than a cream formula.
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 150ml,I use this to remove my makeup at night before doing my regular skin care routine. I recommend this product it’s better than a makeup remover wipe
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 150ml,"I have sensitive skin and don't rely on my cleanser to take off makeup since I take off makeup before I work out and shower after that. This cleanser is thorough enough to handle my post-workout sweaty face but mild enough that it doesn't irritate my skin. 

My one complaint is the packaging—it feels like this bottle will absolutely never biodegrade and, ironically, will end up floating in the ocean. Though it lasts me a long time with each purchase, I feel guilty buying this knowing how little product is in the package. Also I used to really like the gold/purple branding because it was unique. I realize the new light green tone on tone design is much more on trend, but it looks generic to me now. Obviously not enough for me to rate the product down, just annoying to see Tarte jumping on this basic b style bandwagon."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Australia,Disappointing :(,"I wanted to like this as I am a big fan of their makeup... Unfortunately, washing my face with this leaves me feeling like there’s some sort of weird soapy residue on my skin, and I have to wash again with a second product to get rid of it. Gave it two stars because I have super sensitive skin and I didn’t have a reaction to this, so that’s one positive thing at least! "
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 50ml (Travel Size),(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Not for me. Some ingredient in here (I think it's the fragrance) irritates my eyes. It does remove makeup well though. Also the bottle is super cute. I'll be reusing it to travel with
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Singapore,Miss ,"This product is So good! Easy to use and your face feels clean and light after removing your makeup. Will definitely buy this again! Do not need to use a lot. Just a small amount is enough. 
"
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 150ml,"Does not remove makeup or anything extra but its an okay cleanser, the scent is  mild."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,Not anything special,I’ve been using this cleanser consistently as my primary face wash. Pros: smells nice and like that it foams nicely. Cons: for me it’s just too thick. Even if I reduce the amount of product it feels like it’s hard to rinse off my face and can feel sticky or like there’s residue on my face. I think it’s been making me break out along my jaw line because it’s so difficult to get off. It may benefit people with super dry skin more. IMO there are better cleansers out there.
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Australia,GREAT!!,"I love this cleanser. It made my face feel so soft, moisturised and felt really clean. Doesn’t make my skin feels dry like most. Gives your face a little tingle with a mint like feeling I enjoy it as I feel like it’s working. Best gel cleanser I’ve used. Highly recommend "
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,"usually tarte is my fave, this not so much",Not a fan- its a gel so it just feels like I can't get it all off when I rinse my face.  Its so thick. Not for me.
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 150ml,"Love this cleanser so much, my face has been super clear since I've started using it. It's got a mild smell, but I don't mind it. Foams really nicely and leaves my skin feeling great!"
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Australia,Good morning cleanser,"Despite this is advertised as able to removing makeup, I use this in my morning routine. I have oily skin so in the morning, my face needs a good cleanser to get all the oil off. This does the job very well while also very mild. My skin feels very soft & hydrated after using this. I am impressed with this cleanser so far."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Singapore,Doesn't feel clean,"I don't feel clean after wash, it leaves a layer of oil on my skin. Though after wash it will not dries my skin, but i will not repurchase this cleanser again in future. "
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,Feels clean but not tight or stripped.,"I love this cleanser! I use it with a gentle facial brush and find that it makes my face feel clean without feeling tight or stripped. Apparently the smell isn't to everyone's taste but I actually like it. I try to limit the types of fragrance in my facial products, and this plays well with my preferred fragrance/ingredient, which is rose."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Australia,cleared my skin,"This product is life changing, this has cleared up most of my acne. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling super tight and restricted, instead leaves it super hydrated and clean. Absolutely love it "
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 150ml,"Cleared up my mask acne! This not only cleared up my face but made my face look healthy and glowy. I have super sensitive skin, and this was gentle enough."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,no don’t buy,"I dislike this for so many reasons.
When I first got this in the mail the pump part of the cleanser kept popping off and wouldn’t attach to the bottle so I threw it out. Second, the smell is not nice. It reminds me of tea tree oil so that’s unpleasant. When I use the cleanser, it definitely cleanses the skin but it leaves it soooo dry that I can’t last a minute after washing or my skin would crack. My skin is also sensitive/ reactive to certain products or ingredients. So sometimes when J wash my face, my skin burns and is red all around. Not good not good. Only using this up bc I’m waiting for the YTP cleanser to come in stock."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,Worst Cleanser I’ve Ever Tried,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have generally normal and tolerant skin, so I am usually not too picky with cleansers. I don’t think I’ve ever ran into a cleanser that I didn’t really like, until now. 

This cleanser is just all around terrible. It did not make my skin feel clean at all, and instead left a weird oily film on my face. It was so bad that I had to go in with a different cleanser just to remove the gross oily feeling. I honestly can’t believe this is so well reviewed."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,Awesome Gentle Cleanser!,"I was pleasantly surprised with this cleanser! It smells so good, but not overwhelming. It’s a gentle cleanse that doesn’t dry me out. I have sensitive rosacea skin that tends to be dry, but no adverse reaction here. I do double cleanse with a balm first if I need to remove makeup. Most days when I don’t wear makeup, I pair this in the evening with a silicone cleanser brush. Will definitely continue to purchase! Really loving this line from Tarte."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 150ml,I did not like this product. I have extremely dry skin and after one use my skin was thirsty!! It make my face really tight and itchy from the dryness. I love tarte cosmetics so far this is one of few That has not been right for my skin type.
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Singapore,good cleanser,I have sensitive skin so i was a bit worried of the fragrance in it but all is well. It’s a good cleanser to remove impurities and makeup on your face. It’s still a good buy.
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,excellent for sensitive skin - not sensitive eyes,I really enjoy the consistency of this cleanser and I find it has made a positive difference in the texture of my skin while reducing redness. I’m giving it 4 stars because I find its irritating to my eyes and I certainly can’t use it to remove eye make up. I’m on the fence for returning the product for simply that reason (but I have very sensitive eyes).
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 50ml (Travel Size),"I like using my face cleanser in the shower, so the pump bottle makes it easy. Product has a nice smell, doesn’t dry out my skin or cause acne. Mini bottle is perfect for travelling."

TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 50ml (Travel Size),"Great texture, cleans all and leaves the skin hydrated."
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,Canada,tarte Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser  - 50ml (Travel Size),My favourite cleanser. This cleanser is very gentle on sensitive combo skin. I like the light barely there scent. The small bottle has lasted me about a year which is pretty impressive. A little goes a long way. I use this as my second cleanse after removing makeup with a micellar water.  Very happy.
TARTE-Sea Deep Dive Makeup Removing Gel Cleanser,USA,Drying,"I usually LOVE everything Tarte comes out with (especially their skincare, it is a total surprise that they have amazing skincare!) except this one is a letdown for me. Every time I have used it it always dries out my face. I have combination skin and it surprisingly dries me out the most on my nose where I am the most oiliest. I keep using it in hopes it’ll be different one day but nope haha. I saw it claims to have marine algae to help with fine lines and vitamin c for brightening but I don’t see any difference (I know those results might take a while to see with daily use but most cleansers make my face brighter instantly and in an obvious way but not with this one). This cleanser does foam up well though for being a gel/thin liquid consistency. If you’re looking for something hydrating their h20 moisturizer and marine boosting spray is the way to go instead of this (those I’ve tried and are great! I’ve used them on people who have dry skin as well and they work wonders)."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Singapore,Fine if you like oil based cleansers,It does it job well removing the make up but you have to follow up with some other cleanser to remove the oil after it. Overall it's ok.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,"Best cleansing oil out there. Smells great, too!","Clean skin is beautiful skin. This product is still the gold standard of cleansing balms/oils. It's the best out there for keeping your skin clean from makeup, dirt, and pollution. I look forward to using this every night because it smooths over my skin like silk and has a calming scent. There is a reason why estheticians use this product religiously on their clients. Dermalogica is one of the best skincare lines out there which is why so many spas use the line for facials. I have friends who are estheticians who use it on their own faces. If they use it, well I take it as a sign I should, too."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Good but not great,"Nice product but not worth the price point. I ended up returning it. Too many cheaper, and better, options available."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Canada,Holy Grail,Leaves my skin hydrated while actually removing all my makeup. A little goes a long away so it doesn’t go as fast as some other thinner oils.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,I’m in love with this one. The packaging is very convenient and it makes my skin feeling clean and fresh.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Thank you,I am happy and excited to try a new product! I received this gift complimentary from Dermalogica sampling and immediately used it. My skin was refreshed instantly. Thank you for the opportunity to try new items! My skin says thank you!
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,great makeup remover,I looooove this stuff.  I used to use the balm but I felt like I was using too much so I switched to oil.  Melts makeup off so efficiently.  I use it daily even if I only wear sunscreen.  I only subtract one star because it does burn my eyes substantially.  Recommend a separate eye makeup remover (I use Lancôme bifacil).
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,love it for make up removing!,"Love this stuff!!! I used that DHC cleansing oil, which was great, but felt mucky on my face after. This takes my make up off, and also feels cleansing after. It gets a little weird in the eyes area, I just follow up a little closer with a cotton pad (shiseido btw) and some eye make up remover. I use their milk powder exfoliator for my double cleanse. Totally worth it"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"This is it for me. It’s the holy grail of make up removers. I don’t know why I ever try to use anything else. This is so moisturizing and refreshing. The tiniest pump takes everything off with ease. When I’m feeling lazy, I don’t even bother doing a regular face washing after this, and my skin is fine with it."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"I don’t use this all the time, but when I want to double cleanse this is my go-to. Another great product from Dermalogica!"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Canada,greasy film,Does a great job at removing makeup but it leaves a greasy film on your face and hands. I have to wash my face twice after with my cleanser just to get rid of it. After using it on the eyes to remove mascara my eyes are blurry for about an hour. Really wanted to love this cause of all the reviews but i hated it.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"Nice product, leaves your skin tight with no pores and a  pinch hydrated"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"I only use this product when I feel buildup on my skin/when it feels extra dirty and every time I use it, it makes my skin feel SOOOO soft. I don't think it's meant for exfoliation, but it feels like it gets dead skin off too. The key is, you have to rub it on your face for 1 full minuet. Getting in all the nooks and crannies. Then use your normal cleanser for 1 full minuet too. To remove makeup, I would use this after using another oil based makeup remover because you can never be too sure."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"This cleansing oil is pretty mediocre. I have enjoyed Dermalogica products in the past, and this oil cleanser did a good job of removing make up and sunscreen but I don’t feel like I was getting much else out of it. I will say it lasted me about four months, with use once daily in the evenings. I think it’s an ok product, however way over priced for what it does and how much product you get, which is why I only gave it two stars. Definitely unlikely to re-purchase."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"Too oily.  Hear me out.  I've only ever used Tatcha's oil cleanser, which I like very much.  This one takes your makeup off just as well, but unlike Tatcha's, you MUST use a cleanser to remove the oil from your face.  While that's my usual practice, sometimes I just want to swipe some cotton with miscellar water across my face and be done. Not happening with this stuff. I'm sure it's perfect for someone who's used to this type of oil precleanse, but it's just not for me."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Honestly What I’ve been missing !,"I typically use micellar water as a pre cleanse for my makeup wearing and non makeup wearing days and it would still do the job BUT this pre cleanse is that GIRL. I use this on my no makeup days as well when I just want to remove the particles that land on your skin just on a everyday basis being outside. I love the feel of this product on my skin, how it goes on as an oil to loosen the makeup and dirt prior to using wet hands. It turns milky once you add water and you can feel your fresh breathable skin afterwards. I also follow up with the Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel and It is a heaven sent combo for my combination/sensitive skin."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Licensed Esthetician here,"I like this a lot. 
It’s great for morning time when I need to get all my products off from my skincare routine I did at night, and also great at night when I need to get my SPF or makeup off. 
This is a great product! 
Dermalogica fan for life!"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Canada,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"This product is magic, I used to use other product to remove my makeup they made my skin more dry. I finally found the best precleanser for my  skin."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Canada,"Moisturizing, but doesn’t remove make up well",It’s not the best product to remove make up. My mascara isn’t water proof and it still doesn’t remove it all. I find myself using a make up removing wipe after I use this pre-cleanse. I do like that it doesn’t dry out my skin and i feel like it’s moisturized after using this product. It also doesn’t burn my eyes after using this. I will keep it for these reasons mostly but I will continue to shop around for a gentle make up remover/cleanser.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,Holy grail product for sure. Will always repurchase. Love this as 1st step in double cleansing routine. Removes makeup without burning or irritating eyes.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Canada,Doesn’t “melt” makeup,"I was looking for a new makeup remover so I bought the mini size to try it out and I’m really glad I didn’t get the full size. Doesn’t remove mascara, it actually makes it more difficult to remove so I ended up having to use a different makeup remover. Strongly scented and overall just doesn’t remove makeup very well. Super disappointing product."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Canada,Fabulous,This stuff feels like you’ve been transported to a spa to get a luxurious facial. It even manages to remove lash glue and then with just a bit of water it lathers into this nice milky/foamy wash! I definitely recommend it. If you’re using it to take off make up- definitely follow up with regular wash to ensure your face is 100% clean. But it’s a great and more eco- friendly way to remove make up or even just wash your face.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Canada,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"Is this good? Yes. Does it melt all my makeup away without scrubbing? Yes. But I don't get the hype for the size and price tag, you can use a cheaper cleansing oil or micellar water and obtain the same result in my opinion. It's definitely a splurge item and I did like it, but I know of a few other oils I can use and obtain the same result."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Canada,not really for heavy makeup removal,"I was very underwhelmed with this. I found it really difficult to get eye makeup off and I was left with a sizeable amount of makeup left on my face. I was having to double cleanse with oil and then twice again with my cleaner to get my face fully clean. This also meant that I went through the product quickly so I didn’t find it worth my money. 

Also, the packaging was terrible, the pump didn’t work smoothly on mine so it was hard to measure out partial pumps."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Not a makeup remover,I heard great things about this and really wanted to like it. I bought it for makeup removal and was disappointed. You have to really work it hard to get mascara off and there’s quite a bit remaining. Works great as the first step in double cleansing if makeup is not involved. Light scent and nice feeling after. But there are better products to remove makeup.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Canada,So good!!,love it!!! it melts your makeup away and has that clean smell to it this is one of my fav products i have
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Canada,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"I would give it six stars if I could. Melts off ALL makeup with no effort, smells subtle but calming, and leaves my 48 year old skin feeling smooth and clean but not dry."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Canada,never precleansing in my routine again.,"I am new to double cleansing. But this precleansing oil felt pretty thick and greasy and the scent was like a strong Lysol lemon scent. It didn’t remove all my mascara and I had to follow up with a cleaner to get all the greasy precleansing oil out of my skin. Also, after using toner there was still always makeup on the pad. It’s not for me and might’ve ruined the continuation of precleansing in my routine ."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,I love this stuff!! It smells amazing (not perfumery but more like an essential oil) and it does a great job of breaking down my makeup. I haven’t had any issues w my skin since using and it actually does a great job of keeping my skin moisturized! I would recommend buying the smaller size to try first since it’s a bit pricey for the full size. The mini version lasts a while too!
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Canada,too much $$ for quality,"Not worth the money. Smears eye makeup all over your face and stings eyes. Still have to use a second cleanser afterwards. Cleans skin, leaves it feeling nice which is why I only give it 2 stars."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Leaves my skin feeling clean,I absolutely love this pre cleanse. It’s my first time trying out Dermalogica and I cannot wait to try the rest of the products in their line. It did an amazing job at taking away my make up and leaves my skin feeling clean. Applying the product onto my skin feels very nice also. Complimentary from Dermalogica.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"Amazing. Just amazing. It is incredibly soothing and feels so luxurious when you put it on your face. A little goes a LONG way with this product, so the price may be a little steep, but you're going to get your money's worth. After the first use, I noticed my skin felt clearer, and combined with my other skin care products, my face was glowing.

It has a very slight and refreshing smell. Nothing overwhelmingly strong, it's fresh and light which I love. The oil is gentle yet rich going on and comes off so easily."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Must have!,Love this stuff! It literally melts off all my makeup within seconds and doesn’t cause any irritation to my eyes. Will definitely be purchasing again!
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Canada,Not great for scent sensitive people,"I’m not sure where I got the idea that Dermalogica products might not be heavily scented? I think maybe due to the simplicity (classic white/black) of the packaging? This oil smelled very strong - not bad, like essential oils, but strong. It also didn’t rinse off completely. I could feel that my skin still had a coating of oil on it after splashing water several times (perhaps a washcloth is required?). Based on reviews here, it sounds like many find it to be a great product, but not for me. Returning."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS CLEANSER .,This cleansing oil is life changing . Since I incorporated this product on my daily routine I feel my skin cleaner and my pores cleared out so much . Really takes off all the makeup and especially the waterproof mascara . Totally recommend !
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Canada,"The best cleansing oil, but too expensive","I’ve been trying cleansing oils to see if I can move away from micellar water. Of this ones I have tried this is my favourite. It’s a light oil that emulsifies easily, and I like the smell. It also definitely gets EVERYTHING off. Unfortunately, I really think it’s too expensive so I don’t see myself repurchasing; but if you want to splurge this is the 1️⃣"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,Love this precleanse and have purchased 3x. It is a little pricey but it last a long time and I use nightly when I wear makeup which is 5-7 days a week. I follow with fresh soy cleanser or laroche posay gentle cleanser and my foreo
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Canada,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,I really enjoy the fresh scent and light texture of this product! I will definitely order it again! It’s now part of my beauty routine!
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Canada,you need this,this is a must for double-cleansing. I love it so much. It is a bit expensive but so worth it and it stays forever.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,Canada,Great for congested skin,I’ve been using this cleansing oil for 2 months now and I’ve struggled with congested skin for years. Since I’ve incorporated this for my double cleanse my pores have cleared so much. Less blemishes and bumpy skin. Dermalogica has always been a reliable skin care brand
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"This cleansing oil is life changing! Best cleanser I have ever used. Leaves no film on your skin after rinsing and a little amount goes a long way. Great for taking off makeup, even waterproof mascara and everyday dirt and grime. Definitely leaves the face feeling clean and calm."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,refreshing oil cleanser!!!!,Love this cleanser!!!!! It makes your face feel so cool and clean and refreshed I use this in my double cleanse and this is amazing it smells a little like tea trea it’s so refreshing to me and it rinses off great no oily residue at all!! I just wish it was a little cheaper lol…
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Holy grail cleanser,"This was a repurchase for me, l loved itsomuch.
I was using cheap eye makeup remover and became aware I was tugging on my lashes too much. They were falling out. Cleansing with this before your regular cleanser gently removes mascara, blush, spf, etc.  I don't lose lashes with this. Don't be intimidated by the oil factor.  When you rinse this off it feels a bit sudsier and not so oily.   The smell is divine and spa like. It is a little expensive, but my first bottle lasted a bit over 4 months, even with almost daily use. You're good to go with  one pump."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,Dermalogica gifted me this amazing holy grail product. This cleansing oil not only removes makeup but also Sunscreen and debris along with hydrating my skin well. Totally in love with this and would definitely recommend this one.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Great Cleanser,"I am loving this cleanser! It really opens up my pores, cleanses my skin, and leaves it feeling hydrated and clean! I have dry and sensitive skin but this product works great for me! I highly recommend! Gifted by Dermologica."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Holy Grail Precleanser,"This product was gifted by Dermalogica for me to test, honest opinions are my own.
I heard Dermalogica’s Precleanse Cleansing Oil is a holy grail product so I couldn’t wait to try as I am a firm believer in Precleanse or Makeup Removal step in my skincare routine. 
This cleansing oil is gentle yet effective, emulsifying nicely to remove my makeup and sunscreen - you gotta use sunscreen no matter what! Just one pump does the trick, a little goes a long ways. I will definitely be keeping this on my counter as a must have."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,This is The One,"I hate all the makeup removers I've tried in the past. This was recommended to me in store by an associate, and I do not regret this purchase at all. It's so easy to use and it washes everything away without needing to scrub or wipe hard. I use it before a shower and follow up with a cleanser or face scrub. It's perfect!"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Best Pre-Cleanser Ever,"This is hands down the best precleanse I’ve ever used. I’ve tried quite a few like Clinique, Drunk Elephant, Sephora, and YTTP but nothing beats this one. It removes everything, from dirt, make-up, spf and you can feel the dry sebum leaving your pores. This is perfect for all skin types, especially my oily peeps. I’ll always be repurchasing."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Best oil cleanser for people with clogged pores,"Before trying this, I thought I was set on simply using the DHC Cleansing Oil for the rest of my life, but one day I ran out, I couldn't wait for it to be shipped to my house so I picked this up instead. I thought I was just using it until I got my DHC, but now I can't imagine life without it. This is the most thoroughly cleansing oil cleanser on the market and you don't need to wait five minutes like with other cleansers for gunk to start coming out of your pores. A little rubbing and I can see blackheads and sebum galore coming out on my hands. With other cleansers, I would be rubbing for like ten minutes before I could feel the sebum loosening. I have oily dehydrated skin with heavy pores, but you wouldn't know it now. This has kept my skin at the cleanest it's ever been. I'm a girl who has to shave her neck unfortunately so I tend to get a lot of ingrown hairs and blackheads, but since I've started using this, I haven't had too many problems. I feel like the serums and treatments that I've been using to clear up the dark spots I have on my neck are actually getting through because there's no gunk waiting to stop them. Using this in combination with their special cleansing gel, I wipe my cotton pad with my toner and see no leftover residue. It runs out quicker than I would like, but there's no other product that cleans my skin as this does, so on my vanity it shall stay."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,I was gifted by dermalogica in exchange for my honest reveiw. I love that this doesn’t leave a sticky film on my face after washing off. It cleans off makeup so easily and doesn’t sting or burn the eyes. It is great for washing off sunscreen too. It doesn’t feel too stripping or drying as well!
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,perfect for colder times,"I have a very sensitive pale skin that gets easily irritated in colder seasons. Sometimes even peeling, especially the eyelids. This cleansing oil has been amazing! I’d does it’s job and doesn’t dry my skin at all. I definitely recommend it!"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,I loooove this pre cleanse oil. It does such a good job at taking off makeup and sunscreen effortlessly without causing irritation. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a makeup remover! You won’t regret it. Gifted by dermalogica
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,complimentary from Dermalogica - This cleanser gets off all my makeup residue and doesn't dry out my skin which is a plus! I like using this with the clay cleanser which helps me with my oily skin and clears out the impurities from my pores.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"This is a lovely cleansing oil! It’s a perfect consistency that emulsifies effortlessly and removes everything. I love how my skin feels so silky and smooth after, and not dried out at all. I think any skin type would love, received this complimentary from Demalogica."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,This product was complimentary from Dermalogica. This pre cleansing oil gently removes my makeup and it’s non irritating for my skin. I usually use balm cleansing but I’m going to change it to this cleansing oil and see how it is for my skin long term!
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,soft cleansed skin,Loved this oil so much. It melts off my makeup easily and left my skin smooth. It also is really good for oil  cleansing and cleansing the pores. I was able to only use one pump for my whole face which is great! Gifted by dermalogica
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Doesn't strip the skin!,"I have oily skin but my skin gets VERY dehydrated during the winter. Therefore, I'm really cautious on what skincare products I use during the winter months, After using this cleansing oil, my skin feels hydrated instead of stripped. Also, I noticed that this did not irritate my sensitive skin. A winter staple! Complimentary from Dermalogica but all opinions are my own."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Go-to oil cleanser,"Complimentary from Dermalogica, however I’ve been using this pre-cleaning oil for many years and absolutely LOVE it! It gently melts makeup and dirt quickly and easily, for the perfect step 1 when double cleansing! I have oily skin and love using this oil cleanser to breakdown the diets and oils on my skin even when I’m not wearing makeup - it leaves the skin beautifully clean!"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,Great first step gifted by Dermalogica. I used two pumps after splashing water on my face. Removed all my mascara and the rest of my makeup. Followed up with another cleanser to get rid of the oiliness.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Great Cleansing Oil,"This is a great pre-cleanse product, it is a light weight oil that can remove long wear foundation easily. I love how it dissolves makeup by simply massaging over the face and eyes, it is also easy to rinse off. It can be used alone without cotton pads or makeup removing cloth."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"First cleanser option gifted by Dermalogica. This oil works well. It’s not too thick and has a runny consistency, I used a pump and half to remove my makeup.

Once water is added, it turns a bit milky. It breaks down SPF and makeup easily and it rinses off clean. 

The scent isn’t my favorite but once it’s washed off, it disappears."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,not fit acne prone skin,Second time trying this brand and 2nd time I’ve broken out so badly. Not for acne prone skin at all.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,I’m a huge fan of double cleansing and usually go with cleansing balms. This was my first time trying a cleansing oil gifted to me by Dermalogica. I love how easily this removes make up and leaves your skin feeling clean but not stripped. I haven’t noticed any breakouts because of this in the past two weeks of use. Great and less messy alternative to cleansing balms!
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"I was gifted by Dermalogica, but all opinions are my own. This stuff removes even the toughest makeup or impurities super gently leaving skin soft and smooth.
It has nourishing ingredients like Vitmain E, which also protects the skin from damage. It's very easy to use and very effective. It removes makeup fast and effortlessly, without making a mess or irritating the skin. I had to do three different makeup looks the other night and used thus to remove the makeup each time for a fresh face and I'm very impressed! Normally my skin would've freaked out from all the different products but it was unbothered! It makes makeup removal easy as can be!"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Such an amazing first cleanse!,"I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica for reviewing purposes. I am in love! It removes spf and makeup so well. An amazing first cleanse, love the oil consistency. First apply dry to dry face and then add a bit of water for a milky consistency, love that. Instantly became a fave!"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"I'm usually a cleansing balm person & this is the first cleansing oil I've had the opportunity to try (complimentary from Dermalogica)! It's super easy to use and overall less messy than a balm. One pump is enough to work into my skin to remove SPF and makeup (even waterproof mascara). It emulsifies easily and leaves my skin super soft + hydrated. It has a pretty strong citrus scent which I don't love or think is necessary, but that's my only complaint!"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,Gifted by Dermalogica. This pre-cleanse cleansing oil works great! I love how well oil cleansers are at gently removing eye makeup. This feels gentle on my skin and my skin feels so and hydrated after.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,This was gifted by dermalogica. This is a great first cleanse. Helps breaks down my makeup so well. It’s pretty expensive but a little goes a long way for me. Just use a wet cloth or water and you can see the emulsion and the break down
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Good makeup remover,This product was gifted by Dermalogica. This is much thinner than I anticipated. Basically like a micelles water or oil. Did a pretty good job at removing most of my makeup except around the eye (black liner and mascara). Overall it was good I would consider incorporating this into my double cleansing routine.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Fabulous First Cleanser,"I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica. This oil cleanser effortlessly melts away my makeup and SPF at the end of the day. I love how easily it breaks down my mascara for a fuss-free cleansing experience. It also leaves my dry skin feeling clean, hydrated, and nourished. This cleanser has a pleasant and subtle fragrance to it, which I love because I've found sometimes cleansers have too strong of a fragrance for me."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,super soft formula!,"This is my first dermalogica product (gifted by dermalogica) and I absolutely love it! The formula is so so soft on the skin and effectively removes all makeup including waterproof mascara. It also emulsifies very nicely! So far, I haven't gotten any new active breakouts and love it for my acne-prone skin."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Amazing PreCleanse!,"The Dermalogica PreCleanse Oil has easily become one of my favorite new products to use daily!  I love that the oil leaves your skin feeling hydrated and cleansed, and not oily!  My skin is oil prone, and yet this product doesn't contribute to any more oil on my skin.  I've really enjoyed using this product in my lineup, and will be purchasing in the future!  (This product was gifted by Dermalogica)"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,YESSSSS,Gifted by Dermalogica as a gift and it has been such a good additive into my routine! I love double cleansing and this hasn’t disappointed me AT ALL! One of the best and so easily takes off spf and makeup without any greasy layer after rinsing!!
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Nice first step!,This cleanser was gifted to me by Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review. This is a nice gentle cleanser. It has an oily texture but isn't heavy or greasy. It works nicely to remove makeup. It takes off everything except my waterproof mascara. It's a nice first step when you love a good double cleanse like me! It's not dethroning my top faves but a nice addition to my collection.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"This Pre Cleanse Oil is seriously amazing! I've tried a few, and most of them can't remove my waterproof mascara, but this one does the trick! It also has such a lovely fragrance, and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and clean afterwards. I was gifted by Dermalogica."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Amazing cleanser,"Gifted by Dermalogica. As a first step cleanser this works incredibly well at breaking down makeup and stubborn spf's. I had some issues with mascara, but not enough that it would keep me from recommending or repurchasing. 

This truly does melt away everything within seconds of applying it."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Great but wish it had no scent,"Gifted by Dermalogica. Great oil cleanser, removes makeup easily and I love the large lotion-style pump top. Only criticism is that the scent is strong, but that may not be too bothersome since this rinses off. Wish this came in an unscented version!"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"I was looking for something to replace my cleansing balm, and this is a perfect choice. I have acne prone, dry skin, and this works wonders. The texture is runny (duh), rinses off easily, removes waterproof mascara like magic! Gifted by dermalogica."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,A must have!,"This product is a must for everyone that either wears a full face of makeup or applies antioxidants and SPF daily. This rinses all of those layers off so that I can go in with my cleansers after, and my expensive cleansers can actually do what they are supposed to!"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,Complimentary from Dermalogica: Love love love! Been looking for a light cleansing oil that gets rid of all my makeup and this does the job so well. It doesn’t clog my pores or drag my skin. 1 pump is more than enough to do the job so this bottle will last you for so long!
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Gifted but HONEST,"I received this complimentary from dermalogica. This was my first time using a pre-cleanse so I was very hesitant. It turned out to be really easy to use. It takes off your make up very fast, it’s very light weight so it spreads very smooth and it has a very nice scent! This is so much better than using make up wipes! My skin felt very hydrated afterwards. Although it says it is used mostly for oily skin I feel like it still feels nice on my dry skin."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Great for Dry Skin People,"I love how gentle this cleansing oil is! It feels super soft and takes my makeup off super easily without leaving any drying feeling. I am really enjoying this, and I recommend it for anyone with dry skin. So happy to have this be gifted by dermalogica!"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Melts away makeup,I loooooove this precleanser. Definitely recommend using it in the shower vs over the sink just because since it’s so liquified it can get messy! But it melts away makeup and is so nice to use before my normal cleanser to make sure that I have a clean face before applying other skincare!! Thank you Dermalogica (complimentary from Dermalogica).
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Great product,"This pre-cleansing oil is great at taking off makeup! Probably won't reorder as my skin doesn't do great with a lot of oil products, but this product is definitely great, got it complimentary from Dermalogica. Smells really good too!"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,It’s good to have.,"Gifted by Dermalogica. This cleanser is great at removing makeup. I would recommend using a generous amount in order for it to create a real milky texture that removes everything you may have on your face. Although I don’t wear heavy makeup everyday, I really like having this in my skincare cabinet to use on days when I have layers of makeup on for events etc. and I would recommend it to anyone."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"Very effective and not drying! I’ve been using this oil for a while now and it’s been a very good experience. It removes all my makeup effortlessly, and doesn’t irritate my eyes, doesn’t cause any breakouts either. I love the texture and that it doesn’t have an annoying strong perfumed scent - it just smells very fresh. I’ve been using this cleaning oil alongside with other Dermalogica products (ai just looooove their Active clay prebiotic cleanser!), and I must say, my skin both looks and feels amazing. I received it complimentary from Dermalogica."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Meh,I Received this product complimentary from dermalogica. Personally I’m not sure how to feel about it. The scent is so strong I am scared that it’s going to break me out. I generally I’m not a fan of cleansing oil’s because they’re pretty messy and this one is no different. It seem to get the job done of cleansing make up and sunscreen off my face. However it’s not some thing that I find myself reaching for often.
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Removes EVERYTHING!,"Love this product WAY more than any other makeup removers I have used. I have tried the balms before and they always leave my skin feeling dried and my eyes feeling funny - so when I received this complimentary from Dermalogica,  I was nervous for it to be the same way BUT I am a huge fan of this pre-cleanse. It removes alllllll the oils and dirt and makeup from my skin leaving my face feeling clean for my wash and other products! Will purchase when I run out!"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Love it!,"This stuff is really amazing! It helps to clean my makeup and any kind of dirt, oil from my face. Very easy to apply and very perfect for my combination skin. I never had any issues using dermatologica products. I highly recommend this product. Gifted by dermatologica."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Love it!,"I am in love with this cleansing oil. It removes dirt, impurities, and stubborn makeup while leaving skin feeling supple and smooth. It is easy to use, all you need is to apply a small amount to dry skin, gently massage over the face and eye area, rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water. It's also safe to use for removing eye makeup. The result is thoroughly cleansed and softened skin. Overall I loved it and would definitely repurchase it when I am out."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Acne Friendly Double Cleansing!,This cleanser complimentary from Dermalogica has been amazing for my acne prone skin! I’m very picky when it comes to my cleansers. Mostly because I have sensitive skin and I break out so easily! I like the fact that it’s oil based because it breaks down waterproof makeup! I like using waterproof mascara and this melts it away instantly! I totally recommend!
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Amazing Oil Cleanser,Love this oil cleanser I was gifted by Dermalogica! Removes makeup amazingly and leaves skin hydrated. Very gentle and melts away makeup even for waterproof products! Would highly recommend this product and love that it is plant based!
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,I really like the dermalogica  pre-cleanse oil that was complimentary from Dermalogica. It comes out of the pump very oily and liquid LF and turns into a nice lather. It gets a lot of makeup off of my face with ease. The formula does not irritate my skin either! Would definitely recommend this product!
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica.This is a must for my skin care routine! It is my first step to remove make up. Love the oily texture that leaves my skin smooth and not irritated. Love the ingredients as well! Highly recommend it to people who do double cleanse!
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,Possibly the best oil cleanser on the market,"I think this is my favorite oil cleanser. I love that it is a little thicker so that it doesn’t just drip through my hands like a lot of other oil cleansers.  Most of the ones I’ve tried feel like water. It does a great job at breaking down my mascara and liquid lipstick and I love that it can be rinsed off. Many others that I’ve tried require being wiped away with a cloth and still leave an oily film on the skin. I of course always do a second cleanse, but this is great for that first, makeup removing cleanse.

This product was gifted by Dermalogica"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"Gifted by Dermalogica. It cleans off all the make up, which helps the rest of my skin care products absorb well. Keeps my skin smooth and fresh! A little goes a long way, and my skin has been looking clear and hydrated after using it!"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,So lightweight!,I have used this brand for about 2 years now! This specific product was gifted by dermalogica & I absolutely love this precleanse. It is smooth and light and honestly removes a lot of my makeup with barely any left for my actual cleanser. I would highly recommend this product!
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"Dermalogica gifted me this cleansing oil and it’s soooo good! This is the perfect first cleanse, it removes all of my makeup, including waterproof mascara. I will say that the price is a little steep, however it’s worth it with the way my skin feels and looks after using this in my skincare routine!"
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"I was gifted by Dermalogica, but all opinions are my own. The Dermalogica Precleanse oil is the bees knees. I am obsessed. I tried this last year for the first time and was hooked. It melts away even the toughest makeup without stripping the skin or burning eyes like some other cleansers and makeup removers. This helps keep the skin hydrated. I follow up with a Dermalogica cleanser for the double cleansing. I would definitely recommend this oil to anyone wanting to get their double cleansing on."
DERMALOGICA-Precleanse,USA,DERMALOGICA Precleanse,"I am a fan of this cleansing oil. I do like to do the double cleansing method, and I think this product is great for that first step. I like how it gently pulls away stubborn makeup and grime, then you add a little water and it becomes a milky, nourishing emulsion. I will definitely be adding this product to my daily routine! *Gifted by Dermalogica for my honest opinion"
DIOR-Cleansing Milk,Malaysia,Cleansing Milk,Love this cleansing milk as my 1st step of my skincare routine. Makeup and any residue easily removed and didnt dry my skin. Recommended and definitely repurchase
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,New Zealand,A fave go to travel cleanser,"Love this cleanser! Lightweight, smells great and doesn't leave my skin feeling dry after at all. One of my top go-to cleansers especially when traveling because of its size options."
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Australia,MY EVERY DAY GO TO,"if you haven't already tried this then you must exp this fantastic bargain of a set  daily cleaner is fantastic takes all dirt and make-up off including eye make-up without it stinging your eyes, and the moisturiser is great, only a small amount needed is oil free and dosent leave your face looking greasy "
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Malaysia,fav,"recommended. been using since 2017. gentle to skin and good smell. use every morning and night for a perfect skin . the cream does no effect to my skin, but face wash was great . "
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Australia,such a cute deal ,I love this cleanser so much it is one of the only cleanser I would trust to use on my face and the deal is perfect the little moisturiser settles into the skin perfectly too BUT i have realised the moisturiser  it is used as a skin care product before going to bed and shouldn’t be paired with makeup or as a primer as it tends to cake and get rubbery 
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Australia,Great bundle ,"Have always enjoyed the Soy face cleanser, amazing texture and cleansing experience. Great value set to try out the lotus moisturiser without committing to the full  50ml tub that's $78 "
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Australia,Great all rounder duo,"This is a great all rounder duo. The cleaner cleanses skin well, without leaving any leftover makeup, dirt or oils. It also didn't strip my skin like a lot of cleansers do. I did not find it made much difference to my problem area on my chin where I have texture/enlarged pores. Moisturiser is also a great everyday moisturiser for dry skin. Sits beautifully under makeup."
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Malaysia,Perfect Combo!,Love love this duo! The cleanse does a mild & good job in cleaning the face where else the moisturiser really leaves the skin feeling soft & supple even after a days application.Very satisfied ! 
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Singapore,FRESH Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,"Brought the set to try it out for my my skin care routine. Soy cleanser was mild on my face, not dry after using, moisturiser I was great too! Would recommend to those if they want to try out with new routine!"
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Australia,great way to try out the cleanser,"The cleanser I like, it’s a nice, simple and gentle cleanser, which is all I really need, doesn’t break me out or anything and doesn’t have an overly fragranced scent. The duo was a great way to try out the cleanser to see if I liked it, the moisturizer was okay, it’s not the best moisturizer ever, but it’s also not bad, will use it up, but probably won’t purchase the full size"
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Malaysia,Fresh- Cleanse & Moisturize Duo ,"First time got fresh product for my mom. One of the beautician recommended this duo. My mom has oily skin, this moisturizer helps to control her oil secretion. 
Definitely will get a bigger set. "
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Malaysia,this is for gift!,"i found this set is really suit for men , I bought this for gift , it's worth the money as well as the ingredients is so nice , soothing & moisturize skin really well!"
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Australia,love it,I bought this gift pack to try the fresh products. Love it only after one use. Especially the soy cleanser. Make my skin clean and soft. I am going to buy the normal size one. 
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Philippines,been a favorite cleanser for years,I have repurchased this over and over again. I love the scent and melts off my makeup too (except mascara). I wish sephora carries the big bottle which is sold in fresh stores
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Malaysia,definitely a holy grail,Ive been repurchasing this product all over and over again. Its the only cleanser brand that i use and will not switch to other brands anytime soon. Its very gentle and does not make my skin dry and flaky after use. Can be used during day and night. Love it!
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Malaysia,Good trial size,I’m a fan of fresh soy face cleanser. Its very gentle and doesn’t leave the skin feeling tight and dry. But the moisturiser does irritate my skin a little bit maybe due to the fragrance. 
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Australia,Highly recommended it,"The cleanser has helped clear my acne and is super gentle on sensitive skin. It's reliable though expensive. I will definitely be repurchasing the cleanser. As for the cream, I find it a tiny bit oily but moisturising otherwise. It smells nice and is also great for sensitive skin. I highly recommend this set! "
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Singapore,power duo ,this gift set is brilliant. the cleanser and moisturiser are suitable for moderately oily to combination skin. if you are not ready to commit full bottle sizes get this instead. 
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Australia,wow,I have dry skin and it is a challenge to find a cleanser that can remove all impurities and make up without causing the tight dry feeling thereafter.. this one does it job well and smells so good too. I feel rehydrated with each use. quite pricey though but willing to buy
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,New Zealand,I love this pack so much! ,"After years of using the same cleanser and moisturiser, my skin just wasn’t coping anymore and turned into a dry patchy mess. 

I am so glad I tried this! The moisturiser has a cucumber scent which I don’t mind and feels very nice. A little goes a long way! 

The cream is nice too and a little goes a long way as-well. My skin feels so glowy and hydrated. The dry patches are still there but not while this cream is on. Has a similar cucumber scent but so far my skin is coping. "
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Australia,absolutely good,This combo feels so fresh and good for my skin. Cleanser works well and remove daily makeup. Cream absorbs well and leaves my skin Hydrated .Happy with this purchase and would love to try other products from this brand .
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Australia,Great to try out two Fresh products,"Both products are really great. There is some fragrance in the moisturiser and cleanser, but not really a big deal for me."
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Malaysia,Gifts,"Bought this set as a gift to my friend. Intro by my aunt, saying that this cleanser is really good. So, bought the 2nd set as a gift too and bought a cleanser for myself. But, the price is quite expensive."
FRESH-Cleanse & Moisturize Duo,Malaysia,a must try combo!,"The best combo ever!!! I swear I’m in love with the cleanser, and no doubt it is the best seller in sephora. The mosturiser is great as well. Only my pocket not cooperate to repurchase in big size :("
SKYN ICELAND-Micellar Cleansing Water,Malaysia,love it !!! , A Good make up remover!! I love it .. make my skin smooth and not irritate .. coz my skin have sensitive skin so when i apply at my face it not painful.. thanks!! 
SKYN ICELAND-Micellar Cleansing Water,Singapore,New favourite! ,"I love how this micellar water is cooling and leaves my skin feeling refreshed! And the pump style of the bottle is great, just press a cotton pad down on it. "
SKYN ICELAND-Micellar Cleansing Water,Singapore,best micellar water!,"Mine skin, Oily/combination skin. This is the best micellar water I ever tried. I have acnes/pimples at my cheeks n jawline I think it was due to wearing mask. This clean my pores whatever dirt impurities in it. It feels clean and refreshing. The smell doesn’t bother me, it reminds me of I’m in school in the science lab. I tried other micellar, but I still keep getting acne, pimples though I had double cleanse. This one doesn’t, I believe it really did good job cleaning pores. $37 for 155ml, it’s expensive. I really hope this brand available in all store outlet, in the future. "
SKYN ICELAND-Micellar Cleansing Water,Philippines,fungal acne safe,"If you are suffering from fungal acne, this is the micellar water for you. Yes, it’s super pricey however if you really do not want to trigger that fungal acne this is worth it because most of the really cheap but effective micellar water on the market contains glycerin which triggers the said condition. "
SKYN ICELAND-Micellar Cleansing Water,,Nice Product,"Been trying several brands of Micellar Cleansing Water and this is the best so far. Can easily remove make up, and doesn't leave your skin dry. I will surely reorder this product."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Does not remove makeup,This does not remove all of your makeup. I will say I like the feel of it on my skin but it doesn’t work.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,The best,Simply the best micellar water I've ever had. Buying the second bottle
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Not worth the money,Removed my makeup fine but my skin felt like I had used paint thinner to remove my makeup. This left my face burning and in need of alot of moisturizer.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Definitely recommend!,It’s very good definitely recommend it just smells a bit not so  delight!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Singapore,not too bad!,It’s not too bad for light make ups! E.g. bb cushion. Otherwise you might need to use a few times to totally remove your makeup. Most importantly it’s not oily after using it. Got it during the sales.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Singapore,great,Great love and like the item also easy to apply will continue support buy this brand in future and try the others product the important no allergies after used the product 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,love it!,this is great it works really well to take off my mascara!!! make sure to have cotton pads!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,"High hopes, terrible micellar water","This was my first Drunk Elephant product. Honestly, I’m so glad I got the mini of this. I typically use micellar water products to wash my face without water at night time and on lazy mornings, and this just does not make my skin feel clean - and I don’t even wear make up. So it literally just does not make my skin feel clean when I’m using it on just my skin. In fact it dries up into my cotton round and also in my fingers causing me to use more product because otherwise I’m dragging my fingers or the round across my skin. Horrible!

It also takes a lot of product to do your whole face. I am halfway through this bottle and I’ve had it for 2 weeks. I’m not impressed. It gets 2 stars for the packaging and for being fragrance free, I would never buy this again. I have to use a second micellar water afterwards or straight up just wash my face - what’s the point?"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,nice after feeling,Very gentle and does a great job. I like the feeling it leaves on my skin too. You don’t have to wash your face after using either which has come in handy a few times this summer (after applying several rounds of sunscreen). Your skin still feels hydrated. Will be repurchasing.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,super,j'adore ce produit enlève bien le plus gros du maquillage et laisse la peau douce et hyper hydraté.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Milky,"It smells great, looks good, feels good…works okay. Doesn’t remove mascara much. I like the European Bio brand one best—to compare—for the price I couldn’t seem to buy a full size of this. Milky for sure but no worthy price for me."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,good for post-surgery cleanses,"I had surgery on my sinuses & nose & had a cast on my nose for a week (which meant l wasn’t allowed to get my face wet) & needed something that I could put on a cotton pad & “clean” my face. Picked this up & it was perfect for what I needed it for. Gave me a skin refresh + it was hydrating & didn’t leave my skin feeling tight or dehydrated. Did not irritate my sensitive skin either. Nice milky consistency & you get a good amount of product for the price (especially since it’s DE).

Haven’t used it as a makeup remover (obviously) but I’m not sure it would be the best for a primary cleanse. Maybe as a secondary cleanse after a cleansing balm to get the residue off (which is how I’d use it). I think it’s too gentle to be effective (especially for removing eye makeup). But for my cleansing purposes it worked really really well."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,You have to use a lot just to clean one eye. I give it 3 stars because my skin feels soft afterwards with no residue.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,love it,"Smells like oatmilk, removes makeup so quickly especially my mascara it is so good, it just makes my eyes burn a little bit but if you try carefully without it getting into your eyes then you'll be fine, i would definitely buy again."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,not good,not worth it. doesn’t take off makeup especially mascra and lipstick.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Miracle’s in the Milki!,"I don’t usually like miccellar water but this one goes above and beyond! I originally received this product as gratis when I won a gift bag but I definitely am going to purchase once I’m out! I will say even though the scent is fragrance free, it smells like play dough to me. However, it still is a great product. I prefer to use it with a cotton round before I cleanse my skin, instead of a makeup remover. After use, you can really see all the dirt/debris come off. I would highly recommend this to anyone!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,the best,"This doesn’t burn my eyes AT ALL. This is the first makeup remover that doesn’t do that for me. I use my cleanser after this because it does leave my face with a slight film, but that’s no problem because I would do that anyway. This takes off all my waterproof makeup effortlessly. I don’t use it with a cotton pad, only my fingers so that’s a good tip too."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"i have sensitive skin and this product is not for me. i am huge micellar water gal and this was just not it. it didn’t feel hydrating or nice at all. right after my skin was red and sensitive. could be my skin, but i suggest i’d you have sensitive skin using a drug store micellar water that has a much simpler formulation would be better. i’m not sure what ingredient is in here that is making my skin irritated! but maybe for people who aren’t struggling with sensitive skin it would be fine."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Not great,"It removes some makeup, but does not do a thorough job. I also do not like the smell (almost plastic-y or like homemade play dough). Would not repurchase for the price."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,love!,Love this product. Not at all oily or drying sometimes I just use this without washing my face after and I don’t breakout at all.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Meh,This does not do a good job at removing makeup. And I don’t wear waterproof or tenacious makeup either. I need to use so much of this at a time just to get some makeup off. Not worth it. Will not repurchase once I finish it.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"Great product! Not at all drying. I do tend to wear a full face and, I use this as a pre cleanse. It is pricey, but its worth it in comparison to similar luxury products which I have found too drying or contain fragrance. People tend to forget you're paying for the benefits of cruelty free skin care and everything else DE does. Its also woman owned. 4 stars because its not great at removing eye make up lol but as I mentioned, great as a pre cleanse."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Great to remove light make-up. I will buy again. Light texture and no residue.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Nothing special about this product. Waste of money.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,save yourself,literally the worst product i have ever purchased. feels like nothing on the skin and doesn't even take your makeup off.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Gentle and effective. Non eye irritating,"I got this once I started going to the gym more and just quickly wanted to do a quick ‘face wash’ in the gym after my workout. It got the job done for me to be able to finish errands throughout the day without feeling grimey. I’m more oily, so the fact that this is milky just let’s me put on sunscreen and I’m hydrated enough. There’s no scent to this. The texture is like runny, creamy milk- I know, odd that yeah. You don’t need lots depending on what you’re removing. I only use sunscreen and I’m getting rid of the sweat so that’s as far as I am using this product. Sometimes my friends and I get drunk and we paint our eyelids Euphoria style and this has always gotten off the make up! 
I would use a cotton pad and drop like 2-5 (depending on desired saturation) and just rub the pad so the product gets absorbed by the pad and just gently rub around. I clean around my eyes, it hasn’t gotten me irritated yet. Leaves me feeling very refreshed and ready for sunscreen or facial spray. Depends how spicy I’m feeling"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Very Moisturizing,"This is my first introduction to micellar water. I only wear make up for special events so this is not a regular use product for me. I actually bought it for those occasional lazy days when I get home super late and don't feel like washing my face. If I don't do something to sorta get the oils off of my face before bed, I am guaranteed to wake up with acne. This stuff is definitely creamy and moisturizing. Which is great. But at the same time, I wonder how good it is at actually getting the oil off my skin because it doesn't feel any cleaner. It hasn't left me with acne in the morning so I guess that's a positive. But again this my first try with micellar water so I have nothing to compare it to. I like it ok, but not sure if I will repurchase for the price."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Silky and gentle!,"I love this micellar water! It’s so gentle and silky on the skin and it doesn’t irritate my skin at all. It’s really good at getting off makeup and spf, however even after using this to double cleanse (this as my first cleanse and Krave Beauty’s Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser as my second cleanse), I still have stubborn waterproof mascara left over. Other than that, I really like it."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,THE BEST MAKEUP REMOVER!!!,"Amazing makeup remover!!! I was using Lancôme Bi-Facil but it’s too oily. My contacts were suffering. E-Race removed my mascara (UD Wild Lash) & eyeliner (Lancôme 24H Drama Liqui Pencil in Matte), no tugging or rubbing. I just kept wiping (3x) my eyes to be a 100% clean. The smell is amazing & it feels so nice on your eyes. It didn’t sting my eyes or make my contacts cloudy. It also didn’t leave my eye lids or under my eyes dry. Lancôme Bi-Facil always left my eye area dry after use. Definitely worth purchasing!!! This is my new go to make up remover. Thank you Drunk Elephant! My first purchase from this brand & I’ll will be going back for more!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"The best micellar water. Removes even the most stubborn mascara, I’ve repurchased a couple of times. It’s a must have and doesn’t irritate my eyes at all!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Singapore,oily skin,"For my oily skin, it might be leave sticky feeling esp if i dont wash my face after, but i dont mind.. it has a nice cooling effect and remove all the impurities well"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"Nothing special I would rather just get a micellar water from the drug store, it works better than this."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"A happy customer! My skin really like this formula, it’s effective at getting off light makeup while staying hydrating. Second purchase of the Mini size, definitely worth a try!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Singapore,200ml,"This micellar water is very gentle on the skin and therefore good for frequent use. Although it is not strong enough to effectively remove full makeup, it is useful when I just want to refresh my face anytime of the day. Will repurchase."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,"Great Makeup Remover, nothing special though",I usually use the original micellar water from the drugstore but decided to switch over to this one because I love Drunk Elephant. This consistency is a little thicker than most micellar water brands but still does the job. I like it but it's nothing too special. I do like how it's ingredients are a lot better but it is pricy.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Seriously the best Micellar water I’ve found! Cleans and leaves my skin feeling so soft and refreshed. Only downside might be the smell!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,For Sensitive Eyes,"Great to use on sensitive eyes as it doesn't irritate or sting the eyes at all.  Removes makeup and cleanses the face well.  I still like to rinse after using it even though the bottle says you don't need to.  I didn't like how it smelled, but its still a good quality product overall."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,So so…,Okay product. Nothing special about this. Didn’t like it
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,This stuff is amazing! I’m usually pretty good about my skin routine and washing makeup off from my face. I use this to get all of my makeup off including the stubborn stain lipstick and waterproof mascara. My skin feels clean afterwards and not dry.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,ok,i thought it was ok i don’t really know how to use it though.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Best Micellar water I’ve used yet.,"Honestly I’m surprised this product doesn’t have a higher rating. It’s fantastic! I’m an avid micellar water user. I’m too lazy to do a whole routine at night after a long day at work and have to wash my face, so this is a great alternative. It takes makeup off without you having to scrub and rub at all, it’s non greasy and leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean afterwards. It’s great on sensitive skin also, which is a huge plus for me. No irritation or break outs at all. I’ll continue to buy this product every time, it’s by far the best micellar I’ve used to date."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,toner>micellar water,"this is much to expensive to use as a micellar water BUT as a toner i find the price more justifiable. since it is packed with barrier supporting ingredients such as ceramides, vit e, & fatty acids i like to put a few drops on my hand and pat it into my skin when i’m feeling dry & tight. it leaves my skin feeling cool & refreshed. with a watery, milky texture, it is very easy to dab onto skin & i almost wish it came as a spray."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Great all over cleanser,"I really like this product as an all around cleanser. It's more creamy that traditional micellar water, which I think helps with makeup removal, and I end up using less as it isn't splashing out of the bottle. I do have to take a little more time with my mascara, but if you let it sit for a few seconds, it removes it well. My skin always feels soft after using, but it does feel like there is a little residue that it leaves behind. I usually use a mild toner after to help with that. Overall, great product, I ended up buying two."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"Love this product! I got this to take off my makeup around the areas I usually struggle to get with my cleanser (my hairline and jaw line), as well as replacing my old eye makeup remover. This works really well and removes my makeup amazingly!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Singapore,unique texture,I’ve never found a micellar water with milky texture and nourishing effect afterwards. Cleanse my skin quite well and leaves no films. Smells a little rancid after 6 months
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,convenient for people always on the go,"As someone who is always on the go, it can be hard to have a full cleansing session. This product is a game Changer for me. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean. It does smell like play doh, and I wouldn’t recommend applying with a cotton ball because the cotton ball will soak up a lot of the product so you end up using a lot more than you need to but I use my little face scrubber to apply it and wipe away with the cotton ball."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Not worth it at all,Doesn't take off anything except the most easily wiped away powder foundation. Eye makeup? Mascara? Forget it.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,I would not buy again…,This product is hydrating and soft on the skin which is the reason for the two star but would not re-purchase this. I feel like I need a lot of product to get my very minimal makeup daily off. It says to hold product on tougher makeup and not scrub but I feel like I need to scrub in order to get my eye brown pencil to come off. To me this product is not worth the money at all.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,This is a great product!,"This product is great. Don’t look at is just a way to remove makeup. It does a pretty good job removing makeup, but a gentle face wash after is necessary if you’re removing heavy makeup - which you should be doing after heavy makeup use anyways. I love using this every day in the morning to clean my sensitive skin followed by moisturizer, instead of face wash. It’s very hydrating and does a great job cleaning pores. I also find my moisturizer works even better when I use this as a base. I use kiehls ultra facial cream and Ren gentle cleansing milk face wash. I have sensitive, dry, acne prone skin and this combo is doing wonders for me. I only do face wash if I’ve used makeup or if not every other day (trial and error has shown me washing my face when I haven’t used makeup is too harsh and irritates my skin. This product is amazing as a gentle substitute)"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,I’m glad I bought the mini because I’m having a hard time finishing it. It’s not awful but also nothing to write home about. It doesn’t dry out my skin especially around my eyes but it also does not do a great job at removing mascara.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drugstore micellars are way better AND cheaper…,"DE’s micellar water has a watery lotion type consistency, a lot of the product absorbs into your cotton pad (if you’re using one) so you have to use extra product to get the job done, and there’s a distinct play dough smell to the solution—but it is fragrance free I believe.

This is one of the oiliest micellar waters I’ve ever used and it always left a light a noticeable oil film on my face after use. While I typically double cleanse with some kind of water based cleanser after my micellar water step, with my Bioderma micellar I could sometimes be lazy and skip that step while not sacrificing clean skin. With DE’s micellar I felt like if I didn’t use a cleanser after use my skin was still dirty and would likely be too oily for my essence and serums to properly absorb.

Overall I gave this two stars. One star because I have very sensitive skin and over the course of using this for two months I didn’t notice any irritation. The other star I gave is because while I did not like this one bit, it might be somebody’s HG? Somebody with incredibly dry skin, is not acne prone in the slightest, and doesn’t use any serums or watery products after cleansing… just goes straight to a cream.

I subtracted a star because while there weren’t any large breakouts I would trace back to this, I felt like I got a few more little whiteheads here and there than usual. Another star was subtracted because I feel it didn’t do the job and required that you go in with a second cleanse (not optional like most micellars). And the final star was subtracted because drugstore micellars are doing a far superior job than this for just a fraction of the price. Save your money!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"The first time I bought this I loved it, it took off all my makeup and my face felt very refreshed after use. The second time I bought it, it still did everything it had done before but now there’s a strong scent of play-dough that I really hate."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Singapore,Milki Micellar Water,"Love this! It makes my skin feels clean after using it. Very effective when it comes to removing make-up. Will purchase again, worth it for the price "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"Not a big fan, this was sold to me as an alternative for face cleaning wipes and it just doesn’t compare. This is more like something you might use after you washed your face."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,A Nice Gentle Cleanser,I wasn't sure about this product when I ordered it but I actually really enjoy using it. It says you can use it to remove makeup but my preferred way to use it is in the morning as a gentle cleanser. It is really milky and my skin feels soft afterwards.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Quick n Easy,Removes eyeliner and mascara very quickly. I wish I would’ve tried micelles water sooner because it’s so much easier than a balm where I feel a film is left behind or my skin and around my eyes.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,This stuff is great! It’s gentle & does wonders removing makeup.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"One of my favorite drunk elephant products! It's gentle and effective, works for my sensitive skin!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"To give this product the review it deserves, I have to confess a secret: prior to using this I had not been using any form of regular facial cleanser for probably a decade because my skin was doing its own thing pretty well and I didn't want to mess with it (just water and occasionally coconut oil for makeup removal). Coming into my 30s I wanted to expand my skincare routine, but I was nervous about messing up my skin's moisture barrier, so I wanted something really gentle and this is PERFECT. It works well enough to remove makeup but doesn't feel drying or abrasive in any way and my face feels so dewy and fresh after using it. I originally ordered the small size to test it out and I'm already back to order the larger size after only a couple of weeks."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Perfect in the AM,This is an amazing product I use it every day on my dry skin to remove skincare from the night before. It has changed my like and is the ONLY morning cleanse that doesn’t irritate my face! I absolutely love this product.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Great Product,"I got this as a sample before I bought a full size. I had never heard of this before and was surprised at how well it worked to help remove makeup.

There’s nothing bad about it. This part is simply a personal preference: it’s something you wipe off, not wash off and to me that just feels weird, like I’m leaving something on my skin. I don’t FEEL anything. It’s just a mental thing."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,use this for added hydration before my serums,I enjoy this product!  Bottle has lasted me forever. I’ve been using this product as a hydrating essence instead of a cleanser. After I wash my face this adds the extra moisture I need prior to adding my serums & moisturizer morning & night. The ingredients are excellent and my skin responds well. Highly recommend this multi use product
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,A bit smelly,"Love this micellar water, i think it is worth the money as its soft, light, milky and really does a good job at removing facial dirt and debris. I havent yet tried removing makeup but have high hopes. The only two cons to this product are the smell although its not that strong and easy to get used to. The other con is that there wasnt a seal beyond the lid and so i couldnt really tell if the product had ever been used or not. I doubt it but personally, i love that reassurance."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Gives your skin a boost of hydration,Makes your skin feel hydrated and refreshed.  I use it in the morning to give my skin a little extra moisture before putting on my Tatcha water cream.  I use it at night to take off any makeup that  wasn’t removed when I washed my face.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,A Worthy Upgrade To My Old Micellar Water!!!,"I upgraded from my drugstore micelles water. I am not a big face washer at night (I am usually so tired I can’t bear washing my face with water and getting wet). I have been using the miceller water to get rid of my eye makeup. I have not been using it on my face because of the greasy feel. This one is so healthy and moisturizing, I use it all over. I don’t use a lot and it takes off my Pat McGrath eyeshadow and Bobbi Brown Mascara (I don’t use waterproof so I can’t say if that come off as easy). The rest of my face comes off easy too. I love that is fast and I wake up in the morning to healthy skin, not greasy skin. It is worth the price and a real upgrade!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Highly recommend Micellar water,"Im loving microwater for how easy it is to quickly clean your face without having to wash it, its incredibly convenient for on the go and great for if you've been out too late and you are tired. Plus its moisturizing instead of drying! One swipe with a cotton pad removes all the dirt, oil and residual makeup from your face, even when you think your face was clean. The only downside is this particular serum doesn't seem to do anything for my skin other than clean it, a previous microwater I had tried noticeably improved my skin and closed my pores. Overall though I highly recommend adding micellar water to your skincare collection"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Love it but it’s not for heavy duty removal,"Great for a morning cleanse/refresh, and also a great way to break down any remnants of mascara left behind be your cleansing balm or oils. To effectively remove all of your make with this before a double cleanse, you have to use quite a bit. I can’t imagine this product being a good fit for everyone, but it’s creamy and gentle and I was surprised that I like it as much as I do. I don’t think this would be the best choice for people who do a full beat every single day. It’s just perfect for my sensitive skin and medium coverage everyday makeup."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Lovely Product,Very gentle on my skin. Leaves my skin feeling completely clean. I don't wear foundation so it doesn't take much on a piece of cotton to cover my face and neck. Definitely purchasing again.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,if i could turn back time...,"I wish I could tell past self not to buy this last year. For half the price (CDN), you can purchase a bottle of Bioderma, which is way more effective at removing makeup in my opinion. Unfortunately, all this did was move my makeup around, or fade it out..the only thing good I can say about it is its certainly gentle on the skin. That's it. Please just save your money, its not worth it!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Love this product!,"I use this product every day after I do a workout, and it's great for getting all the sweat and grime off – it leaves me feeling refreshed and clean! I don't think this would be great for getting off a full face of makeup (although I haven't tried), but it's definitely a great choice as a light and gentle cleanser when you aren't wearing any makeup.

I especially love that this product has never left my skin feeling stripped – most cleansers leave my skin feeling tight/dry right after, but this one never does!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,yummy!,"Good amount for the price, like how it works and feels. Would love to have it in different packaging, for whatever reason the bottle doesnt sit well, maybe I’m crazy.

Does what it’s supposed to do and doesnt strip my dry, dry skin!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Mediocre,"I have yet to finish it ... i bought this in hopes to stop using makeup remover wipes and I still end up reaching for the wipes. Save your money, theres other stuff out there"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"Ok for what it is. I have used this for about 2 months now and while it does make my skin softer, it does not do a good job of removing sunscreen on my face. I noticed that when I apply toner after my second cleanse, there is still sunscreen being taken off my face (my sunscreen is slightly tinted so I am able to tell). Not worth the money."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Amazing Morning Cleanser!!,"The first time I used this product I hated it. It irritated my eyes and it just wasn't as effective as the makeup removing balm from Drunk Elephant. Now I use it as a morning cleanser and any time I need to do a quick clean in a pinch without using water! By using it in the morning it has made a huge difference in my skin. I have less dryness and redness and overall my skin feels really nice and prepped for the day. Personally, I think that if you want a product that removes makeup, use the makeup removing balm from Drunk Elephant instead. I would highly suggest this for morning or quick day time cleansing, like after working out!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,worth the money,"I have very sensitive skin that reacts to everything, but it loves this. It gives your skin a good cleanse and makes it soft and glowing."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Not for mascara removal,"The product itself is very gentle and hydrating on the skin, but it doesn't deliver quite as well on results. It doesn't easily remove mascara and you have to use quite a bit, making it not particularly worth the money. I'll continue to use the rest of the bottle, but I won't buy it again."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,BUY. THIS.,My favorite makeup remover EVER. It always leaves my skin feeling so soft after and it’s the easiest thing I’ve found to remove heavy eye makeup !!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,DOESNT DRY OUT YOUR SKIN,"Ive tried a loooot of micellar waters and this is by far my favorite! I use this after exercising during the day so I don’t have to wash my face and irritate it more. I don’t recommand to use it to wash your face at night, but it’s great for a quick refresh."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"I love this Micellar Water, I gave it 4 stars because it definitely does not take off waterproof products like mascara/eyeliner so I wouldn’t use it as a makeup remover HOWEVER I’ll use this all over my face before bed sometimes instead of cleanser (if it’s one of those days) and it does take the oil/dirt away, doesn’t make my face feel oily or really dry AND doesn’t break me out which was a winner for me because my skin is really sensitive"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"This made me break out, and I don’t have sensitive skin. This also felt so weird, almost like it was literally doing nothing. I’d also try to put it on a cotton to wipe my face with and it’d soak in too quickly. I was having to use too much."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,I love to use this after a workout or in the morning. It’s not the best to remove heavy make up but works great for a gentle non irritating cleanse.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Does the job!,"This is the first micellar water I have tried but it works well for me. I use it to touch up smudges and take my make up off, mostly eye make up. It doesn’t leave a noticeable film. Not scented."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"I love this product! I initially received a mini size as part of another DE set, and it has now become one of my favorite Drunk Elephant products. I don’t wear a lot of makeup, so this works perfectly to refresh my face and remove my mascara at the end of the day. It makes my skin feel clean, smooth, and hydrated."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,hard pass,"I don’t get what all the hype is about. I only like this as a refresher after waking up because beyond that - it’s not good. It doesn’t remove makeup completely - it might help with bits of mascara under your eyes after double cleansing - which sounds silly. 
You have to use so much product to use it as an actual remover - 
I will not purchase this again."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,This is not a micellar water,"This has a texture of watery lotion or milk, it is not good for removing make up. This is not a micellar milk in a sense the other brands are calling it. A lot of the product is needed to make it work and avoid panda eyes, really need to scrub and rub (against the instructions on the package) to see any result, even after soaking my eyes and lashes in this product. Misleading advertising, questionable purpose, will not repurchase. I’m usually a fan of DE products, wanted to find my mew favorite eye make up remover, but this ""water"" is not it."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,holy grail morning cleanse/prep,"I don't use this for makeup removal & don't recommend using this as your only cleanse if you are using this to remove makeup.. otherwise use the Slai makeup melting cleansing balm instead, it works better & I recommend doing a double cleanse (makeup removal & second cleanse). This is my absolute favorite for a first thing in the morning cleanse, it does the job to remove any leftover skincare from the night before & adds hydration & preps my skin for my morning skin care routine. I also like this as a mid day refresher or almost as a toner before my night time skin care. I find this way more nourishing than the standard micellar water & has better for your skin ingredients. I have sensitive acne prone skin & this has never caused an issue."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"Cleansing in AM & PM can be drying and stripping for my face, and this product helps me be able to keep my face clean by using it in the morning instead of cleansing. It’s really hydrating too! I do use it some at night before cleansing on light makeup days. But it’s mostly for the morning to clean my face before the rest of my routine. I was getting the mini size for awhile and it would last me 1.5 month  at least if I was using it primarily in the am! I didn’t experience any negative side effects or reactions."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Good Clean Micellar,"I used to use the Beauty Water from Son and Park, but switched to this as Sephora no longer carries that product. This micellar really is ""milki"". But it is gentle and I enjoy it in the morning for a quick facial refresh and after a workout. Its gentle but I don't love it for mascara/eye make up removal. No eye burning but just not super effective. Will stick with Tatcha one step cleansing oil for eye makeup removal."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"I’m addicted to this stuff! I accidentally ordered two and I’m glad I did because I use it throughout the day and I’m sure I will in the summer too. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean! I’m a face toucher when stressed and I have 7 kids... including twin toddlers and teenagers, so I’m stressed just a little bit. I take a couple of mins to sneak away and wipe this on my face for a quick pick me up and it’s helped to keep down on extra oil from so much touching."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Choose another DE cleanser,I love Drunk Elephant products so this review is hard.  This micellar water does not work as described.  It does not remove make-up or cleanse.  Not sure what happened here. All the other DE cleansers are great.  Skip this product and choose another of DE cleanser.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"This is my second favorite drunk elephant product (after the c-tango eye cream). While it’s not a desert island product and I COULD live without it, I don’t ever want to. The consistency is like a thick, milky water, and I wouldn’t use it as a stand-alone makeup remover, but it’s a great second step after cleansing to ~erase~ any leftover makeup and really feel like I’m cleaning the day off my skin. I also use this on work-from-home days when I need a quick refresh in between meetings. My skin always feels soft and lightly moisturized after I use this, and I particularly love that it’s clean and gentle enough to swipe across my eyes and lips. Weirdly enough, I feel like the product is almost most beneficial/refreshing on dry lips, and I like to think that it makes my eyelashes look a little healthier too."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Great morning cleanse alternative,"I have dry skin so I don't like to wash my face in the morning, but I do like to feel like I have a blank canvas. I didn't want to use a typical micellar water because I was worried it would be too stripping or would need to be rinsed off so I bought this. It works perfectly for what I bought it for! I have not tried to remove makeup with it, but it does remove any leftover evening products (I slug with Aquaphor at night so I usually have some leftover in the morning) without leaving my skin feeling stripped. I do not rinse it off so I can say it does not break me out, or interfere with any products used on top of it in my morning routine or makeup."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,LOVE but...,"I love love love this product. It leaves your skin so supple and smooth. I just wish you didn’t have to use so much of it. I wear mascara, under eye concealer, and a little bronzer daily and I feel like I shouldn’t have to use so much of this product when I don’t use that much makeup."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Drunk Elephant E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,"I received a-ease as a sample as a part of one of the DE kits and have been using it in the mornings instead of washing my face. It feels super nice, leaves my skin clean and hydrated and ready for my next steps of my skincare routine. Will be purchasing full size once the sample is finished"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Really effective and no sting!,"This is by far the best makeup remover I have ever used! Although it’s a tad pricy the size is huge so
 I think it’s worth it. My favorite thing about this product is that it doesn’t sting my eyes when removing eye makeup.I’ve always had so much trouble removing eye makeup because other products would burn or sting so much that I would give up and end up not getting everything off. This gets my makeup off with no sting and breaks everything down so quickly I’ve repurchased twice already."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Love this product !!!,"This is the first time I tried micellar water and It’s the best cleanser I’ve ever tried.  Here’s why.  I bought it to remove makeup and I was so surprised it solved my biggest problem - oily t-zone. I have combination skin - oily t-zone and normal/dry cheeks.  This micellar water is gentle, odourless and works instantly dissolving all the oils on my t-zone with no rubbing. Just apply generously and tissue off. Huge time saver. I find that I don’t need to use the toner afterwards, since my skin already feels clean and it’s a LOT cheaper than my go-to toner (Kiehl’s calendula toner). I’d stock up when the 20% off promo (for Rouge) is up."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,At least it's natural,"Well I would have given this two stars for being a natural and non toxic product but I'd say that would be generous unfortunately. I tried a sample size of this and perhaps I'd need to try it for longer next time but I really can't fathom spending money on this product since it didn't work for me. It has high reviews as do most DE products, and I do like their Protini for example, but the smell of this is awful! I do not like the fermented smell, too stinky for comfortable use imo. For makeup removal I'd recommend a cleansing balm all the way, those work wonders in comparison. As for this, it didn't even hydrate my face so it's a no from me sadly."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,LOVE IT!❤️,"Love this product! It removes all of my makeup and leaves my sensitive skin feeling hydrated and soft! Takes care of any other oily/dirt areas and I haven’t had any breakouts since using this product for over a year! Love, love, love it!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,USA,Left my skin soft,"I got a sample of this with one of the year-end bundles.  I don't wear tons of makeup, so I can't speak to how it handles more than mascara.  That said, I really liked it.  It removed my mascara and left the rest of my skin soft and clean.  The sample size was also very generous, unlike a lot of the DE samples.  I did not purchase because I don't typically use a micellar water, but if I were inclined this would definitely be at the top of my list."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water,Canada,Soothing and Refreshing,I really like this product and my skin likes it too! It’s soothing and preps my skin nicely. I usually just pour a nickel sized amount into my hand and pat it on my skin before I put my hyaluronic acid and moisturizer on and it’s so refreshing and helps lock in moisture. It’s not a necessity in my opinion but it does feel soothing.
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water Midi,Singapore,Good for dry sensitive skin,"Its not cheap but for sure it wont break you out. The gentlest hydrating miclar water ever, the Milki is formulated for people with all skin  types but essentially for those who break out using micellar water."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water Midi,Singapore,Excited,"I am quite excited to use this, I am looking forward for it as I wanted double cleansing but I have dry skin so this will be my first step towards cleansing "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water Midi,Singapore,gentle yet powerful,A bit on the pricey side but I like the milky texture which doesnt strip skin’s natural moisture. Does a good job cleasing despite the gentle formulation. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water Midi,Singapore,Drunk Elephant Micellar Water ,Bought this Drunk Elephant Micellar Water to try and i love it. Finished the 100ml bottle and repurchased again. It cleans off make up residue pretty well and doesn't feel like stripping the skin. This micellar water is really gentle on the skin. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-E-Rase™ Milki Micellar Water Midi,Singapore,Will not buy again,Product didn’t remove makeup properly and doesn’t spread well on a cotton pad. Don’t like the texture. Will not repurchase and don’t recommend this product at all. Micellar water is so much better
LANCÔME-Galateis Douceur,Singapore,ms,Milk cleanser……Suitable for acne prone skin for makeup remover….Removes makeup thoroughly and is gentle on skin. To avoid eye area.Smells great too. Been using this for decades
LANCÔME-Galateis Douceur,Singapore,A good buy for the price and material,I have been using it for many years and love it.
LANCÔME-Galateis Douceur,Malaysia,Trying,Read the reviews and they are good. So I bought 2 bottles for testing. And also I am out of Milk Make Up Removers in my storage. It is a big bottle too. Hopefully it works as good as or even better than Estee Lauder's.
LANCÔME-Galateis Douceur,Malaysia,gentle,love this make up remover. I have sensitive skin and this milky texture helps to remove my make up safely. be gentle when you decide to use this in your eye make up as it can be quite stinging 
LANCÔME-Galateis Douceur,Australia,Wouldn't use anything else,I've been using Galateis for more years than I care to admit.  It still suits my skin totally.  I love that it easily removes mascara as well. No more black eyes.  The texture is non-greasy and leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.
LANCÔME-Galateis Douceur,Malaysia,Won’t repurchase ,"Not impressed with this make up remover. The cleansing effect is very mild, it takes a lot of time to reapply and remove with cotton pad to remove makeup. Micellar water works better compare with this. "
LANCÔME-Galateis Douceur,Australia,Gentle,"Very gentle and effective.  
Beautiful for mature skin"
LANCÔME-Galateis Douceur,Malaysia,nice ,"I like this product as it able to clean my face but not drying up. This is repurchase product, and very comfortable feel, which is very gentle to our skin. Do not have any stinging feel. Recommended.
"
LANCÔME-Galateis Douceur,Malaysia,Miss,"This product doesn’t do its job properly. Feeling sticky after cleanse (not a great experience) and cause breakout. Too strong fragrance for me thats really unacceptable. Im really disappointed, maybe I shouldn’t gets my expectation high next time."
LANCÔME-Galateis Douceur,,Surprisingly great cream cleanser!,"This was a real surprise for me. It's priced so affordably, for such a large sized bottle. It cleanses thoroughly, removing all my makeup. I use it as the first part of my cleansing. It's gentle too. The texture is very liquidy so i tend to use about  3-4 pumps every time. I'm only half way through my first bottle and I've already bought the second one to standby. "
LANCÔME-Galateis Douceur,,Good product,I’ve been using this make up remover for many years. It didn’t cause me any breakout and it leaves my skin smooth after using. I use it to remove my eye make up too but I don’t wear mascara.
LANCÔME-Galateis Douceur,,the best makeup remover ,this makeup remover makes your face smooth and cleaning all the dirt in one time. i love this one because it contains papaya extract and smell good and fresh after use it
LANCÔME-Galateis Douceur,,so far so good,"Just finished my hg oil cleanser (shu uemura) and started this big size bottle milky cleanser. I have oily combo skin, so far it did not cause me any breakout. It feels coldly good as you apply and massage it in your face. However, it doesn’t remove your heavy duty eye waterproof make up, you still need another eye remover for it.  "
LANCÔME-Galateis Douceur,,Best cleanser ever!,"I've used this product for more than 12 years and never been disappointed. One of two cleansers that I use, the other is Bi-Facil. Galateis Douceur is like no other cleanser. It does an amazing job of removing every speck of face make-up. Smells great too and has a creamy light texture. My skin feels clean, silky smooth and moisturized, not oily. I'm 48 and they say that I'm not even close to that age. I credit Lancome products for that. Please do not discontinue this product. Thank you Lancome!"
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,my second bottle,a bottle of this last really long! use this as a makeup remover and it does removes everything with minimal effort. the balm would be less messy but I find the liquid easier as in you don't need to dig the balm out. this has a pump! 
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Nice Cleansing Oil,Have been using make up removal wipes for a long time but decided to change to this cleansing oil cos it’s less harsh on the skin. Tip: Double cleanse and all your make up for the day will melt away
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,good,one of the best cleansing oil ive ever tried serius best nak mati dia betul2 cleanse all the dirts on your face weyhhhh kalau guna tetiap malam boleh laa tahan dalam 2 bulan. 
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Basic oil cleanser ,"Pros: Does the job of removing make-up well, doesn’t irritate my skin or eyes 

Cons: Still prefer a balm cleanser as oil cleanser can be a little messy to manage at times. This is also too pricey - there are more affordable oil cleansers out there :)
"
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,just nice,"The cleansing oil is just nice. Not that bad, just okay.

Quite good at removing makeup but it broke me out a bit. Not sure what makes me break out but yeah, i just don’t like it but it is a good cleansing oil.
"
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Clinique Cleansing Oil,"I've read many good review about this, and although I feel that it's good enough of a product for me to feel that I haven't wasted my money, I doubt I would repurchase because it doesn't always remove all my makeup (after 2pumps) even if it's just a small amount of foundation. It does everything an oil cleanser is supposed to do and doesn't do anything we don't want oil cleansers to do clog pores, hard to wash off, and etc. for me It is pretty basic though so I kinda wish it was cheaper. "

CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Clinique Cleansing Oil ,"First time trying out this cleansing oil from Clinique. Well, it does not make my face feel too oily unlike other brands. It has the right consistency and it’s gentle for my sensitive skin. Overall, great product
"
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,like it but tedious to use,"bought after been getting as a free gift many times from Clinique. Does do the job very well, but very leceh to use.. If you're the lazy type like me who just want to grab a wet wipe makeup remover, then this might not be for you. But, it's a real good product to wash off heavy makeup, tho.."
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Singapore,A good cleanser,This cleanser is really good. I love how this leaves my skin feeling really clean and fresh. This also doesn’t dry my skin out. Works well with my sensitive skin. Highly recommend
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Singapore,a dream to use,I do double cleansing and this is the perfect first step for my double cleansing. It leaves no residue after washing off. Takes off all makeup except super waterproof eye liner and mascara. Other than that. It removes all traces of makeup very well. 
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Best Cleansing Oil,"My holy grail. Best cleansing oil ever. Been using the oils since September-20 for my daily double cleansing routine. I have oily and acne prone skin. Since I work at construction site, my skin usually exposed to dirt and I also wear sunscreen that has pore clogging ingredients. The cleansing oil did amazing job cleansing my pores and it doesn't make my skin dry at all. It also reduced my acne a lot.... like 90% a lot better than it used to be. Highly recommended. "
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Best daily makeup remover ,"I have oily combi and acne prone skin, i wear makeup everyday to work, this is by far the best oil based makeup remover that is very gentle and doesn’t leave too much oily residue which can be used on its own occasionally but I prefer to use another gel/foam cleanser after this for double cleansing. it can remove heavy makeup quite thoroughly! On my second bottle. Quite an underrated product "
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,Fav cleansing oil!,This is probably my must-have cleansing oil. It breaks down even waterproof makeup effortlessly and has a very silky texture that's easy to massage into the skin. It doesn't sting my eyes thankfully. I also love how it doesnt irritate my already sensitive-acne prone skin and has no fragrance or essential oils. 
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,squeaky clean,I like the design of the bottle and it came with a lock so you don't have to worry about spilling it. It does not contain oil but it works like oil so the pores wouldn't be clogged. My skin feels cleaner after using this cleansing oil together with facial soap. 1 pump is enough for a whole face so it would last long.
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Singapore,My go-to! ,My ultimate all-time favourite oil cleansing. Used this as the first step of my double cleansing routine. The texture is just nice and it doesn't sting my eyes even if it happens to get into them. Have been though at least 10 bottles already and will continue to repurchase!
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,not bad,"
I decided to use this for a period of time before giving my review. Honestly, Not bad at all. It melts all the makeup residue on my face. Very easy to wash and cleanse. 
I’ll consider repurchase this product! "
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Singapore,does the job ,"It does the job of cleaning my make up so four stars. 
Although I prefer the shuuemura cleansing oil more than this, this is much more friendly to the wallet! "
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Singapore,Clinique Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,"I’ve tried the balm version and I honestly feel like I prefer the oil better, as it doesn’t get in my eyes like how the balm did. the cleansing oil is lightweight feels almost like water. it is not oily and it removes makeup well. however I will still double cleanse with a cream cleanser afterwards. "
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,Malaysia,love it!,This is my daily makeup cleanser. It’s totally help me to remove my waterproof make up and very easy to remove waterproof mascara without make my eyes stings. It also very suitable for my dry skin.
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Daily Double Cleanser,I use spf everyday and would double cleanse my face with this. amazingggggg! love how it works easily and of course without the irritation and dryness
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,not bad but not perfect,My emergency to go to when Shu Uemura Porerefinist is not available and I don’t want to spend too much. Small bottle which I used up relatively quick. Good performance but not as fantastic as Shu Uemura for me. 
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Love it!,"Skin feels really clean not squeaky dry. It leaves a mositurising feeling after using, good for dry skin, am on my 3rd bottle now and still loving it!"
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,great!!,"This product is very good!! It does what it’s meant to do, eye and lip makeup is removed and it also does not leave any residue behind. Would repurchase!"
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,BEST,been using this for the last 2.5 years and swear by this...Take around 1-1.5 pumps of this to remove all makeup (even waterproof) and then go over with the clinique cleanser. Both are super gentle on the skin and would highly recommend this product
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Clinique cleansing oil,"I have been using this product for many years, we I use waterproof makeup. This product helps to remove all the makeup on my face easily without the need to rub too hard."
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Does not clog pores,One of the best cleansing oils. Deeply cleanse the skin and doesn't clog pores or cause breakouts. Always follow this step with a gentle cleanser before my skincare routine.
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Love it,"I read numerous reviews before selecting this make-up remover and i am absolutely happy with it. The make-up remover does a good job at removing all traces of make-up and if you wish to concentrate on a particular area, i use 1-2 pumps onto a cotton pad to wipe off the make-up. This is the 2nd time i'm re-purchasing this product."
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Not something I'd repurchase ,"It does an ok job at cleansing and rinses off easily but I found my skin breaking out when using this. When I switched back to the balm version of this, my skin cleared back up. Not sure if I'm allergic to this or it just doesn't cleanse as well as the balm. "
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,good,"Gentle remove dirt, no feel oily without drying and oily, can remove waterproof mascara and eyeliner 
So worth, 200ml can last for three months
Will reorder "
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Great for sensitive skin,Been using Clinique's balm before switching to this. it works more effectively than the balm and is ever so gentle on my sensitive skin. No drying sensation. A definite repurchase. 
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Ms,Product works as what it claims to do! Removes makeup pretty well overall. Just take to take note that it is slightly difficult to remove waterproof mascara. 
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,forgotten stqple,"I forgot how much I love this cleansing oil since i started using micellar water. Recently i feel like my skin a little drying and I want a gentler way of cleaning my makeup. But not all cleansing oil are created equal, so I turn back to my old staple and I can still feel the luxurious feeling when taking my day off. I take back my old love. "
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,The best,"The best make up remover after trying out many different ones. After massaging your full face once, it melts all of your makeup like a dream, be it thick or thin. After you wipe off the oil and rinse your face, your skin will feel really clean. Usually ill just stop there because that's how clean i feel it is but you can follow up with your normal cleansing routine if you want to:) Might be pricey but worth it as it lasted me for a year as u only need a small amount to remove you makeup."
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Clinique Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,I’ve discovered a way better one in the form of Chanel L’Huile Anti-Pollution Cleansing Oil that contains blue micro-algae to help protect the complexion from pollution and marine salicornia extract to mousturize and soothe.
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Great at removing makeup ,This is a great first cleansing step to get off makeup and sunscreen. The oil rinses clean and removes almost everything. I usually still follow up with a cream cleanser though:
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,love it! ,This is one of my favourite cleansing oils... Fragrance free and leaves my skin very clean.  It emulsifies very well and doesn't clog pores or cause breakouts... I always follow this step with a gentle 2nd cleanser before my skincare routine. 
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,😍,"This cleansing oil does not make my face feels too oily. It has the right consistency, and I really enjoy massaging it all over my face to remove my makeup. A little pump goes a long way as the oil is very effective in dissolving makeup, including stubborn waterproof eye makeup! I am impressed. It dissolves everything in seconds. There is also no residue left after rinsing. I did not experience any break out or stinging around my eyes throughout my use. I honestly cannot find anything I don't like about this product."
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Best cleansing oil,"I have sensitive acne prone skin that is dehydrated. Before I purchase this cleansing oil I have tried the take the day off cleansing balm which I also love. But it’s quite a hassle to scrap the balm out with a cotton bud or your fingers as I don’t find it hygienic. Hence I tried this one and I love this even more than the cleansing balm now! Fragrance free and non irritating, does its job of removing all the dirt and makeup. Doesn’t leave a film of oil after cleansing. Non drying as well. "
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,"Removes all, but not deep within","I love double cleansing, and this products really works wonders on long lasting waterproof eye-liner or mascara, but need to put more effort on removing concealer or foundation (cause sometimes there's still tid bit stain of foundation/concealer products when i applied my toner after cleansing)"
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,melts your makeup like butter,"Purchased this after reading good reviews about it.  I'm never a fan of oil based cleanser but it really does get rid of heavy duty makeup easily.  I usually use two pumps to clean the whole face and the good thing is that once you rinse your face with water, it just feels really clean.  "
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Decent,"I use this as the first step of my double cleansing routine. It takes off make up okay, but I still found some remnants of make up left over. Might need to do it twice. For the price, I expected better. "
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Best Makeup Remover,I have oily skin but using this has not worsened my skin condition unlike other makeup remover oils. It is gentle on the skin yet able to remove even the most waterproof lipsticks like Kat Von D's! Never regretting getting this. Only downside is it gets out of stock really quickly. :(
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,My go-to make up remover! ,Compare this to Shu emura and I still prefer this. Just a tiny bit is required to remove makeup on the whole face and not drying at all. I did not try removing waterproof mascara though as I always remove before using this in the shower. Kudos Clinique! 
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Would def buy it again,This thing removes the most stubborn makeup like waterproof mascara and like stubborn eyelash glue that just won't budge. It cleanses the skin so well without stripping any oils so your skin is still nice and baby soft
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Say hello to soft skin,This cleansing oil removes makeup and cleanses at the same time leaving my skin oh-so-soft and dewy. It's oily consistency makes it easier to use in my opinion. I love how it's fragrance free. Will definitely repurchase this. 
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,great,One of the best make up remover I've ever used. As compared to the one in a pot I'd rather get this because it's much easier to use than to dig product out from the pot. Gently removes makeup and does not irritate the skin which is super great for sensitive skin! 
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,good to have make up remover,works well on my skin! take off makeup all entirely but need to immediately rinse it off coz it leaves oiliness residue on your face and palm! next purchase maybe i should try take day off balm make up remover.
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Great buy!,"I used to use the cleansing milk (same clinique series - take the day off) but switched to this when the cleansing milk was out of stock once, and I love it! I think this is ironically better for my oilier skin. I use it in the shower to take my makeup off, and it works like a dream. Very effective and doesn't strip my skin of moisture either. It also doesn't break me out."
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,so far so good,"I have oily and acne prone skin and after reading the reviews, I have decided to give this a shot. It hasn’t broken me out so far, which is great! I feel that it does pretty much the same thing as the boscia make up break up oil.. I may not re-purchase as I like the boscia one just a little bit better.. just a little bit :))"
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,good but not necessary ,"I've read many good review about this, and although I feel that it's good enough of a product for me to feel that I haven't wasted my money, I doubt I would repurchase because it doesn't always remove all my makeup (after 2pumps) even if it's just a small amount of foundation"
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Love this to death,"Ever since I've started using this, I have forgotten about all my other removers. Removes everything, literally. Waterproof make up or not, everything comes off. Doesn't dry out my skin as well. HG item for sure."
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,Literally Taking the Day Off,"I personally think it's an amazing product, whether you're cleansing with cotton pads or just with fingers. It's not definitely not up to parr with Shu Uemura's Oil Cleanser, but it does the job well, and not to mention, it is much more affordable. :)"
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,best!,"Best best best cleansing oil, great for sensitive or acne prone skin even better when used in conjunction with the take the day off balm (as a double cleanse). Takes off makeup and any impurities without drying the skin."
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,the best cleansing oil,"Since the technique of 'double cleansing' became popular, I started looking for a cleansing oil that is suitable for my sensitive skin. after I make a comparison with other products, I find this is the best product for my skin but this products is difficult to find because there is no sale in Clinique stores and finally I find it at Sephora website. Thank God my  acne is increasingly recovered after use this . After I wash my face with cleansing oil with the dry face, I wash my face with water and use another cleansing foam. My face felt so clean and fresh."
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,The best...,"Wow! This cleansing oil is amazing.. it takes away all my make up, including my water proof better than sex mascara! It is really worth the price, I was eyeing  for shu eumura, lucky the bigger size was out of stock back then, so I opted to buy this Clinique take the day off cleansing oil and I have no regrets! I even saved some bucks.. I've been using it for almost a month now, my is skin oily combo but I don't have any problem with it.  "
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,great value for money,Much cheaper than Shu Uemura but does the same job in  my opinion. Size is very travel friendly as I travel a lot for weeks at a time. cleanses my makeup effectively without feeling too harsh on the skin. 
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,My Holy Grail ,I just use 2 pumps each time and it is soooo effective. 10/10 for makeup removal and my face feels extra clean every time I use it. Love love love this and would recommend to anyone who's in the market for a cleansing oil with great makeup removal properties. 
CLINIQUE-Take The Day Off Cleansing Oil,,love this cleansing oil! ,"for someone with acne , problematic combination skin ,  this cleansing oil is great for removing makeup and does not dry the skin out . i would say i prefer this over my old HG cleansing oil which is the she uemura porefinist cleansing oil. love this !"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Malaysia,Convenient size but unrealistic to remove make up,"Since it's a mini, I need to use a few to have a good   wipe on my face. It's definitely something that will only last for 2 use at most. Not realistic to remove make up. Maybe good to wipe a make up free face."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,Cutie,This travel makeup remover pack is super handy and portable. It is great for a weekend trip or just travelling. No need to bring out a makeup remover and cotton pads. It is only palm size. Love it!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,not so useful,i didnt think it was going to be this small the tissue. abit too small for the full face. prefer the bigger packs which is more value for money. i was hoping the smaller pack would be easy to take for travels but its really too small the sheet. will not buy again
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Malaysia,Ms.,"A very handy cleansing face wipe, mini versions are always easier and convenient to carry around. A quick clean wipe before re-applying my sunscreen on the road or even on sweaty days. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,Mini face wipes for travelling ,"This i my favorite face wipes, good for travelling. And it smells so great T.T 
I would love to have a whole line of product with this exact watermelon scent; Body wash, body lotion, body butter, shampoo, moisturizer etc. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,face wipe,love the scent for this face wipe... easy and light to bring around whenever I go for staycation or swimming or a day in the beach.. it cleans off my make up well..
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Malaysia,good product,This foundation is so good makes the skin dewy and luminousu - would be nice if there were more shades however especially with more of warm undertone but overall makes my skin look amazing
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Australia,wonderful makeup wipes,"These makeup wipes were so lovely and the packaging is adorable. They removed all my makeup and didn’t leave any residue and and the scent was so calming and I honestly just wished they came in a bigger pack. 

"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Malaysia,nice one,have tried so many cleasing make up wipes. but this is one of the best. easy to remove make ups.and travel friendly. it has sweet smell and worth buying
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,ms,First time using this and it’s actually not bad! It didn’t irritate my skin and my eyes. The smell is ok but I would want it less fragrance. Will prolly try the full size and other smell.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Australia,great mini wipes,"It is a great mini wipes to take to travel. I like watermelon flavour. It cannot clean makeup as good as cleansing balm, but good for emergency travel use "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Malaysia,good product,"Brought it because I want a mini wipes to keep in my handbag whenever I’m out and about. Convenient, smells watermelon faintly and works. Might buy it again"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,abit small,"A little bit small but still nice to use. Cleans makeup right off and smells good too! I bought others from the same series too, different fragrances and all of them work well! "

"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Philippines,Easy to use,The Sephora Collection Original Cleansing Face Wipes in Coconut Water comes in a mini size which I thought was so cute and convenient to travel around with
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,"smells good, travel friendly","item is compact and can fit into handbag. nice smell that i like. still prefer oil-based removers, this is probably more suitable for light makeup removal."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,Easy conditioning makeup wipes ,"These wipes are easy to use and can be carried along in handbag. 
Wipes even eye and lip makeup."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,Terriblr scent,"The makeup remover wipes are ok in function in the sense they do the job, but the scent is extremely unpleasant and overpowering, will never buy again. I prefer the cucumber scent im the wipes with blue packaging. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,Not impressed ,"It smelled nice, but it was stinging my skin and eyes. I will not recommend it, especially if you have got sensitive skin. I managed to clean my makeup but not my waterproof eye makeup."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,convenient but requires a few wipes to remove all makeup ,"Won’t deny how convenient it is to carry these wipes around, especially for travelling but would recommend getting the larger pack instead of this mini one as one wipe is not enough to remove all traces of makeup. The makeup remover is also slightly drying to the skin. I do like the smell of these watermelon wipes though"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,near expiry,"Sucks that Sephora clearing stocks and giving out products expiring in less than a year. Do not buy sales items. If I can give 0 stars, i would do so."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Australia,Ho Hum,"These just didn't do it for me.  It does take off a fair amount of surface makeup but not a deep clean - as you would expect from wipes anyway, so not just this brand's product.  Still, there was nothing about the feel or effectiveness of the wipes that would compel me to repurchase.  Alright in a pinch."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,Wipes work well & smells great,Price point is great.  It works well to take off all the makeup & and the smell is great. I always buy the wipes for travel purposes as it is small & compact to carry around. Highly recommended

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,nice,usually don't use makeup wipes because they don't remove naked completely. but always have this one in hand in case of emergency. very compact and easy to carry around.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,decent,usually not a fan of makeup wipes because it doesn't clean up face as well as expected. but this one really works and can be used when too lazy or don't have proper makeup remover.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,Cute,"Cleanses well for me which i dont wear heavy makeup, cute size very tiny about the palm’s length? great for travel or just to bring around in ur bag. Smells refreshing too"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,love the wipes,East to use. Handy and convenient to bring it out on travel. Wipe off easy on heavy make ups. compact. smell nice to me. repeated purchase with other fragrances.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,Easy & Convenient ,"This is easy to use and easily removes a whole face of makeup. Multiple purchase of this series already - my favourite is the watermelon. Does the job of makeup removal for sure, but yet to try for waterproof mascara. Probably not."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Australia,Nice basic wipe,Fresh light scent. Not too abrasive. Great for those quick look changes or touch ups. Also great for a quick brush clean in a pinch. Would recommend a larger pack as they don't last long and do dry out. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Australia,Travel Use Only,"Wipes don’t do the best job at removing makeup. Melting balms, micellar water and double cleansing are much more effective. However when travelling they are really useful. I use wipes for lipstick changes and to remove eyeshadow when doing cut creases."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Australia,Instant refresh,"These wipes are good for on the go, they are refreshing and have a light scent!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Australia,nice product ,I got these while they were on special and I think they are pretty good. I usually don’t use wipes on my face but these are soft and smell really nice for when I need some 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,Good wipe and recommended ,"Great wipe, not oily and feel moistured after use. Just that the mini wipe is small so can only wipe off light face foundation and powder. Probably not mascara or waterproof eyeliner. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,Bright Skin..,"My face is bright and so smooth! It even feels like I put a serum or moisturizer on because my face feels silky! I’m sold, I have to keep repurchasing but not sure yet if I’ll try a different one. I think this is 100% worth the price because you get the exfoliation and moisturizing for the price of one and you only need one wipe a day."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Australia,Smells good,Subtle but nice scent
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Australia,Cute,Good for travelling as it doesn't take up much space
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Australia,nice ,"These makeup wipes smell lovely and do their job, although they do tend to run out of moisture quicker than others. Great for only $3 though! I would recommend if on a budget for sure. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),New Zealand,useful ,"Just pocket size for travel or an emergency to get it on your purse! Quite calming scent, fully recommend to get things easy! Perfect size for traveling "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),New Zealand,"good for your bag, not much else","these wipes are meh. they’re good in an absolute pinch, but do not use them regularly. the smell is a bit too strong and leaves a weird film over the face after use. i don’t recommend these "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Australia,Handy,"Compact, easy to use, perfect for small bags. Used this while I traveled. The watermelon scent is not overwhelming. If you don’t have micellar water or no water access, this can be an alternative but not for regular use. Cleans well."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Malaysia,good for traveling!,the smell is nice and the size is definitely great fot traveling. we can smoothly remove our make-up even on the bed. I like the watermelon smell so much.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Malaysia,not bad ,bought this as I wanted to get wipes for myself so I added it while purchasing other stuff.. it's not great and not bad either.. wouldn't purchase again
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,meh,"Too small, I have to use at least 4-5 to take makeup off. Weird “coconut water” smell, very artificial. Low quality product. Didn’t like it and will probably not purchase again "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Australia,don't like,It cleans well. I tried it on my face and it leaves my face so dry. But I will give it 2 stars since it removes all waterproof and non waterproof makeup well. I use it just to wipe my hands when i do swatches. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Australia,perfect on the go size,these adorable little wipes are just the perfect size to chuck in your handbag or wallet for on the go. I cannot get enough of these! I use them as an alternative to baby wipes now that my daughter is a bit older but equally as grubby haha!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,comfy pack,"Great to take with you, fits any bag. Removes makeup, even party makeup. Give 4 stars because it is a bit drier than I wish it would be. It’s enough to take off makeup but the mascara goes off a bit hard, would be better with more formula on the tissue."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Malaysia,Original Mini Cleansing Face Wipes,"Thank you very much, Sephora, for offering this mini pack of Original Cleansing Face Wipes. These wipes are mini in size but really help in removing the makeup. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Malaysia,Regular cleansing wipes,"Travel friendly .. not too thick . I thought i would love the coconut smells compared to the watermelon since i bought both , but it was vice versa. Bought this on sale , if not i would just buy a regular one at drugstore"

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Malaysia,not bad,It's ok. Cleans out most of the impurities but I still have to wash and cleanse my face again because there were some residue left. I guess would be suitable for less make up. Nice travel size.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Malaysia,Coconut face wipes is the best among the rest,"This face wipes worth every penny. Got it during sale because I wasnt sure about the coconut  fragance been wipe onto my face. Tried propaganate, watermelon, I did not like the smell at all. But I have no regrets on this one.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,Mini wipes ,"love how compact the packaging is and it works to clean out make up on the face like most cleansing wipes do it’s wonder, however it doesn’t give you a deep cleansing feel. it’s just to wipe off the top layer of make up and need to use facial cleanser to fully clean the face. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Australia,So convenient and smells amazing,"So handy to keep in your handbag, big enough to remove eye makeup and lip makeup and smells just like your favourite fake watermelon candy. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Australia,Smells great...,Havent really used them to remove makeup....but they smell great.    Cute pack to keep in your purse and use as refreshing wipes throughout the day....
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Australia,mini indeed,This product removes basic makeup well. I know the description says mini but it is so mini to a point that it is not very friendly to use. It doesn’t clean mascara well enough to be used as eye makeup remover wipe only and takes 2 wipes to cleanse day makeup. Probably good for a weekend away only. Not a fan of the artificial sweet smell either. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Malaysia,A handy tools,"If you always on the go, this is very good when u want to clean your make up before go to pray. It Clear the makeup in fast and does not drying up ur skin . "

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,Cleansing wipes are a no no,"Better to use a cleansing oil rather than wipes. As dragging, tugging your skin will make your skin wrinkle and sag faster.. for $6 its also expensive as it can finish fast"

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Singapore,"Wipe was slightly smaller than expected, but smells great and removes non-waterproof makeup well","This smaller sized pack was great for removal of make up for those days where I only put on concealer + brow products. I personally don't think it was large enough to remove a full face of make up with foundation + waterproof mascara though. Nonetheless, each wipe was well saturated and smelt lovely! I didn't get any skin reactions (I don't have sensitive skin)."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Australia,Mini wipes ,Good for travelling . Best for your bag. Watermelon smell wipes is a reviving and its good on your skin . I liked it.but not a big fan at all for this wipes.

In terms of makeup removal, I use this first and then a cleanser since it’s not entirely effective. Cute packaging with a pleasant watermelon scent."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Malaysia,Cheaper option & handy!,Small but handy. Wont recommended if having a sensitive skin. Avoid using this around eyes area. It does it job very well just like higher brand face wipes too. So recommended to buy if you dont want to break a hole in your pockets!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Original Cleansing Face Wipes (Mini),Malaysia,Decent,"Leaves my skin irritated. The makeup that i want to remove from my face ended up smearing all over my face rather than getting it off my face. However, it is convinient to use when travelling or during busy hours."

JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Gentle exfoliant,"I’m 53, and this has worked beautifully on the dead skin cells that had been accumulating along my jaw. It exfoliates without being harsh."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,New formulation is terrible,"Whatever they did to their product's formula is awful; the cleanser is thin and runny, and it's difficult to feel like your face is getting properly cleaned. Forget about trying to use this as a mask too, because again, it's way too thin now. It's a shame because this was such a nice, reliable face wash."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Canada,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"Amazing cleanser for my oily, sensitive and acne prone skin! I am in  my 40’s and have tried everything and I mean everything in skin care to try and tame and crazy sensitive, oily and breakout skin. I bought this for my son as hes now experiencing breakout too and this has helped clear both of our skin! It has lasted forever too since you need very little to get your skin clean! Awesome product and amazing price point!"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,great as a mask,I run and wear waterproof sunscreen every single day so I need a cleanser that works well. I have combination skin that leans towards oily in the t-zone and dry everywhere else. As a mask I think this did a great job cleansing my pores and soaking up oil. I have a few clogged pores that are very stubborn and didn’t clear them out but the rest of them looked pretty good. I actually bought this for my husband for me to “borrow” this on occasion he really likes it and his skin looks clearer. I wasn’t blown away by the results but thought they were good. I was impressed that this didn’t leave my skin feeling dry. If it had helped unclog my pores/ help remove blackheads better it would have been a five star product.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Canada,Good for a MASK,"As a cleanser this is EXTREMELY harsh. Would never recommend this for daily use - even with a good moisturizer this will destroy your moisture barrier and you will be more acne prone/prone to pigmentation. However, as a mask every once in a while it is phenomenal. I notice a glow immediately after use. If this was marketed differently I would give it 5 stars, but to market as a cleanser is irresponsible."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Canada,fine gentle exfoliating wash,This is a nice finely milled scrub that leaves skin soft and polished. It’s expensive but a little goes a long way.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Canada,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Bought for my husband but I use it all the time haha. I love the gentle scrub you get with it! One star off because the formula is a bit runny.... if we’re not careful we end up with a handful of the stuff instead of the drop needed.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Excellent as a spot treatment or for deep cleaning
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Great for acne,I purchased this for my son and he loves it! It has really helped with his acne and large pores.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Canada,Less suitable for dry skin - otherwise love!!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Giving this four stars only because I had samples so I haven’t been able to see the effects on my skin after consistent use. I found this a bit drying but I have oily skin so no biggie. But as far as cleansers go I really like it! The creamy consistency foams up so nicely and it had a slight cooling effect which feels wonderful. If my skin wasn’t so sensitive to new products I would want to try a full size immediately.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Canada,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have sensitive skin and it burns my face a little. It's also super drying. It's not suitable for my skin type.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Canada,The Fountain of Youth Minus Blackheads,"I've struggled with large pores on my nose for about 20 years and my skin texture started getting rough when I turned 30. After using this face wash/mask for a few months, my skin is way less dry, the texture is smooth ALMOST like when I was in my early 20s, I get less breakouts, and my pores look noticeably different. I use this as a mask between 1 and 2 times a week, then I wet my face and lather before washing it off. All other days, I wash my face with water and occasionally use organic lotion if the weather is very dry, but I predict that I'll stop needing lotion altogether soon. This stuff turns back time if you use it consistently, which isn't hard because who doesn't love a spa moment with a mask that has been made using ingredients from the fountain of youth??"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Canada,Best clay mask!,"Jack Black continues to impress. I love their peel pads and now this treatment. I’d never use it as a daily cleanser — waaay too harsh and drying; you don’t want to use clay-based cleansers anyway, because they parch your skin. But as a clay mask — yes to the yes! Pulls out all the crap from my pores and leaves skin feeling healthy and glory for a few days after."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Not for me,This did not do it for me. The energizing scrub I LOVE but unfortunately this seems like a very gentle cleanser and I prefer a more aggressive cleanser. I would recommend for someone who prefer a very gentle cleanser
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Not recommended as a face wash on any skin type,"Your skin has to be indestructible for this to work as a daily face wash. It will dry you out immensely if you use it daily and you will need a good serum and moisturizer to rebalance your face. Works well as a mask but I would not recommend this as a face wash.
I even had my fiancé try to see if it is just my skin, since we have opposite skin types but same result."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Such a Deep Clean!,"Wow. Just wow. Such a Deep Clean! I have combination skin with an extremely oily T-zone. This cleanser not only cleans your pores deeply and leaves them feeling fresh and clear for 12+ hours, my t-zone has been so much easier to control in terms of oiliness. I have no issues following with my normal skin care routine (toner, serum, eye gel, moisturizer). My skin feels clean, soft, and supple all day long. I use a more moisturizing cleanser at night just because this cleanser tends to REALLY dry up oils. But other than that, my skin has never been clearer. I haven’t used this as a mask because I prefer Glam Glow masks, but this makes a perfect once-a-day cleanser!"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Amazing product it’s cleared up my husbands skin!! Perfect for ingrown hairs.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Canada,YES TO THE YES TO THIS!,"I've used this product both as a mask as an exfoliant; Because it's glycolic acid it was very tingly and I would keep it as a mask for 10 mins and wash it, or other days I would just use it as an exfoliant. Guys ... My skin was sooo bad, so uneven but this mask did wonders. After about 2 weeks my face was satin smooth after I paired this product with The ordinary Glycolic toner and the Ordinary Lactic acid 10% I had no pores! My dark spots disappeared and my skin was even and brighter!!! I definitely recommend! It's a life saver and give great results!"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Ladies BUY THIS,"I rarely write reviews. I bought my boyfriend the skin care travel kit with this in it, and I ended up trying everything of course. This is *the* best chemical cleanser I’ve ever used. I let it sit for a few minutes in the shower and when I got out my skin looked fresh, right, dewy and less red. I have extremely sensitive skin from using tretinoin and suffer from eczema in general. This does not sting or irritate which is shocking because it’s truly effective. Works a million times better than Peter Thomas Roth or other glycolic cleansers. Don’t sleep on this one! I hope they never discontinue it."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,WORKS WONDERS AS A MASK!,"I purchased this during the Spring VIB event based on online reviews.  My skin is combination and I live in a humid climate, which contributes to my oils coming out daily.  I used this as a mask and my skin was smoother.  My oils are also significantly decreased in my T-Zone.  I'm very pleased with the results as a mask and the great price point, especially compared to other brand that make you pay for the name, but don't perform as well or at all.  There's also a fantastic amount of product for the price you pay.  Definite win!   I'm definitely putting this on my favorites list on the Sephora app and repurchasing when this tube is done."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Canada,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,This makes my skin significantly les oily. I will buy this again
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,feels good,"Finally got my boyfriend serious about skincare. He loves this cleanser, it leaves your skin feeling so clean and balanced."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Canada,Cleanser Caution,"I've used this both as a mask and a cleanser. It's the first time I've used a chemical exfoliant, and the first time I've chosen a cleanser based on ingredients. It's an amazing cleanser, but you do need to be careful how you apply it!

On the bottle is tells you to lather first, then put it on your face. Do not ignore this! 

I was lathering it on my face and it caused irritation (no, really? rubbing both volcanic ash and glycolic acid all over your cheeks makes them angry? Shock! Amaze! Who could have seen this coming?). The irritation went away after about 3 days and once I started putting it on a face cloth and being gentle with it the irritation disappeared. The reaction was 100% my fault, and it focused on the areas where I was lathering, and after some research it makes sense. The volcanic ash and the glycolic acid together are great exfoliation, but if you add scrubbing then you're basically double/triple exfoliating, which will of course cause irritation.

I would also be careful using it as a mask for this same reason. Let it rinse off in a shower or something, but don't scrub it! My skin will came out feeling soft and lovely after the mask, no scrubbing required!"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Canada,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) My husband loves this face cleanser. I find it helps with my oily skin and does not dry it out. Fanstastic
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"My husband loves this cleanser every time he uses it. Now if only I could get him to be more consistent with skincare, we'd really be in business!"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Best product hands down,Such a good cleanser and mask! My congestion and random breakouts are gone. as well as my pores they have shrunken completely. I love this as a spot treatment too for my cystic pimples.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"Really enjoying this product. Actually took a few uses to get the right consistency of the product as the first few times it was just weird water coming out.
If you have blackheads, I think you will really enjoy this product because after every wash my nose seems clearer which obviously means that I’ll be doing less extractions. 
Gives the skin a nice clean feeling and isn’t drying at all. 
Skin type: dry combination"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Canada,Awesome,I love this stuff. I got it as a sample the first time and used it to the last drop. And immediately bought more. Just a small amount goes a long way and it really clears out the pores.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Canada,not just for men!,"Great cleanser for oily, congested, acne prone skin. The gentle exfoliate helps to clear skin imperfections. My skin looks and feels great after using, so affordable too."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Great staple,"My skin doesn't feel stripped or tight after I use this, which is the key thing I look for in a cleanser, since I'm prone to dryness. I've been using this for several years, and when I compare it against products I've received samples of, I like this better."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Canada,My favourite cleanser,I love this face cleanser.  It’s not harsh on my face.  I use it every morning.  I have really oily skin that is sensitive to certain things but my face loves this stuff!
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Canada,Great face wash and mask,"I've purchased this twice now, both times for my husband but I end up using it. Effective to take off makeup and the mask feature is really amazing. I notice a difference every time."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,My favorite cleanser!  I use this in the morning as I find it's too drying for me twice a day.  It is great to clean out your pores and my face always feels super soft after.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,NOTICEABLE CHANGES,"I really, really like this facial cleanser. I received it as a free sample and used it mindlessly once I ran out of my usual (fresh rose cleanser). I noticed a HUGE difference in my skin and realized this cleanser was to credit! I’ll be purchasing this over my fresh cleanser from here on out."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"After receiving a free sample of this, I’m obsessed and just had to order a full size tube! I have dry, very textured skin, and I’ve been struggling to find a facial cleanser that is cruelty free, doesn’t dry me out further and doesn’t smell like a perfume shop."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Love this! It’s amazing. Makes my skin feel so clean. However I’m not happy that the price jumped from 24$ to 29$ in the matter of months....
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Great product!,"This was a repurchase for me (third time) as I've been using it for years. Even though I use it almost everyday, this tube lasts me 4 months or more. A little goes a long way, and I find it fantastic in managing oil and clearing my skin - so much so I bought another for my sibling and his face cleared up in a week. Overall, excellent. I've never used it as a mask, but I'm assuming it works just as well."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Amazing for texture!,"I never leave reviews but this product has helped my skin so much. Last summer I had the worst skin, unevenness, texture, and acne. This product minimized each of those things by I would say 80%, as I kept using it, I definitely noticed a difference in my skin. It was extremely helpful and even though this is for men, women can use it as well."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Skincare Staple !,"I use this product every day in the shower as a cleanser and it's super gentle, a little goes a long way. It has worked wonders on my dry and flaky skin, I couldn't be happier with how soft and smooth my skin is now!"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Awesome product!!!,Amazing face wash - my pores have never been so small
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,First choice every time,"Leaves skin smooth and nicely exfoliated.  My husband got this in a Jack Black kit a few years ago but didn't use it, so I did and was extremely impressed!!! Not to mention it's less expensive than the facial products that are marketed towards women!!! Love it!"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Keeps breakouts at bay,"I used to get a lot of breakouts from clogged pores before switching to this cleanser, it's phenomenal. For as potent as it is, it really isn't very drying, either."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Does the job,"I don't know if this is for guys, but I got it as a free sample and I got 3 uses out of it. It was the right amount of gritty for scrubbing my face gently and it smelled ""vegan"" if I may use that word. It left my skin feeling clean which I like. If you like those things then you'll like this product. It's pretty straightforward. I'm personally looking for something that makes me feel more special whether it's helping me stop time on my face or works well with a clarisonic, both things that this product doesn't do, but still, that's my honest review. :)"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,My husband used this when he was having breakouts and reactions to his usual cleaner. This product cleared up any blemishes quickly.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,FINALLY,"I finally found my FAVORITE cleanser after all these years. While it’s marketed towards men, it works wonders in all skin. I recommend this to everyone. You can leave it on as a mask for longer if you want too and your skin will look amazing! As good as the glam glow clearing mud mask. Seriously recommend!!!!"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"I had decently clear skin before using this product, never really broke out with blemishes, but I thought I’d use this product to clear up the close up black heads. Ever since using this product, my skin has been the worst it’s ever been and more noticeable in the areas where I most frequently apply this “cleanser”"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Great as a scrub and a mask. Leaves skin soft.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"Really really good cleanser! It’s supposed to be for guys, but it isn’t rough on my skin—in fact, it’s exactly the type of no-nonsense, no-fuss “gets the job done without bells and whistles” cleanser that I’ve been looking for! I subtracted a star because the dispenser isn’t the best design, which makes it a bit wasteful and messy, and it’s a tad bit drying but that’s to be expected with a deep cleanser. If it’s uncomfortable, I dial it down to using this once per day, only three times per week-no more."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Love it!,"Love this face wash/mask. Doesn't over dry my skin.  I usually have oily skin, but in winter it will get dried out periodically."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,best cleanser I've ever used and I've used a lot. I had never used JB products until recently and I could tell a major difference in my skin after a few uses.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"This product destroyed my skin. 

I had a deluxe sample that I used semi-regularly over a period of 2 weeks, and was encouraged by the results. Soft skin, reduced blackheads, etc; didn’t hesitate to order the full size. When it arrived, I upped my usage to 1x daily as recommended. 

Considering the fact that I don’t have sensitive skin and had been using the product already, when my skin broke out into the most horrific full-face breakouts I have EVER had, I looked to everything else as the potential culprit. It took me almost two months to blame this cleanser—particularly since the breakouts got more or less intense depending on where I was in my cycle, so I thought the issue could be more serious/hormonal. Nope. I just get oilier at certain times and this “deep dive” made a point of accentuating that regularity. With ridiculous numbers of whiteheads and honestly scabby-feeling dry spots. 

The long and the short of it is probably that I am not well-suited to the glycolic acid, and regular use dried the ever-living heck out of my face. I can accept that as my responsibility. But holy heck, be aware that this product can cause such a severe reaction because I wouldn’t wish it on anyone."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Must have,Love this! Its helped with the tiny hard bumps that nothing else touches. Leaves your face so clean.  It can be drying so don't over do it if you have dry or sensitive skin.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Amazing!!!,I use this everday!amazing and gentle enough to use every day. I am female in my 50's and just perfect for my skin. Please contime to sell !!!
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"Leaves my skin feeling very clean and happy. Just be sure you’re ready to tone and moisturize immediately after washing, as this stuff is fairly drying. Also, I accidentally got some in my eye and it was a nightmare to clean out. Those tiny exfoliating granules do wonders for my pores but they felt like sand in my eye and were extremely hard to flush. Nevertheless, it’s great product for my 40 year-old skin—especially on the days I don’t have time to double-cleanse, once with a lather, once more with an abrasive exfoliant."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Great product,"I buy this for my fiance and he will not use any other face wash! He used to never be into skin care at all, but this stuff is so great that he loves skincare now. He uses many of the Jack Black products and has really enjoyed all of them."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,WHAT PORES?!,"A part of my daily regimen! Use as a mask and leave on as directed on the instructions, or wash it off right after application.  This product tightens pores, etc., MUST HAVE!!!"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"I really like this cleanser, feels really comfortable and not super harsh. I tried it when it was offered in bazaar rewards, really liked it, now got a full size"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Very good one.,"I got this for my 21y old son who has oily skin, he loves it, and say that he really feel good when he washes his face with it."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Love Love Love !,"Love love love !!!!!!!! It’s gentle yet not too gentle as it still exfoliates. Also, this has helped my acne. I really like this face wash."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Amazing!  Makes your skin feel so soft afterwards.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Superior for Removing Heavy Make-Up,"I'm a woman who wears a heavy foundation-Estee Lauder Double Wear- and this is the only cleanser I've found that thoroughly removes makeup. My skin looks great. Breakouts reduced too! Although Jack Black is marketed for men, this cleanser and their exfoliator is great for women."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Awesome purifying mask,My boyfriend and I both use this. It's a great mask that really cleanses and leaves your skin super soft. Love it. We are both faithfully using it and will continue to do so.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Husband/Boyfriend New Go To,Bought this for my husband and now we are on our second bottle! He is extremely oil with sensitive skin and this helped him SO much! Sometimes I sneak some for a nice cleansing mask!! Great face product for oily skin!
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Great for everyone!,Incredible. Recommended to me by a friend I use it nightly and once a week as a 15 minute mask. Helps reduce my acne a lot and makes my face feel so smooth.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"This cleanser has helped so much with my oily face. I use this about 3X a week, as a gentle exfloliator cleanser, and my acne and pores and oil have improved significantly. It's great for sensitive skin, exfloliates enough without leaving your face red, and leaves you feeling matte and clean. I don't use this everyday as I have very fair, sensitive skin, but I would still recommend this product."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Good for gentle yet highly effective exfoliation,"I purchased this cleanser for both myself and my husband. I had used samples before and became obsessed with it. It is a gentle yet effective exfoliation because it has both chemical (salicylic acid) and physical (grit) exfoliants. I also use it as a mask by applying, allowing to dry then working off with wet fingers. My husband loves it because it makes husband skin smooth and as he says “there is no wrong way to use it, so it’s easy.”
I have dry skin and blackheads, I find the cleanser helps buff away the buildup that dry skin causes and the ash helps pull the oil out of my pores. 
The only downside to this product is that the packaging, notably the cap is not great quality. I dropped it once into a towel and the peg inside the cap broke and clogged the whole where the product dispenses. I’ve dropped lots of product in my day and this has not happened, so I’m disappointed. If we hadn’t had a spare cap from another jack black product the cleanser would have dried out."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Do you have a Dad?,"Ok I have never used this, but my Stepdad will not shut up about it. I gave him a bunch of Jack Black products for his birthday, and he now thinks I invented skincare.   Seriously.  Buy it for your Dad he will tell everyone."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Great for acne prone skin,"I got this as a Sephora bday gift last year and gave it to my teenage son to use, it worked like magic for his acne. I bought the full size together with the moisturizer  and he has been using them ever since , highly recommend!"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Skin saver!,"Hopefully I’m not speaking too soon, but I’ve been using this for a month now. I am truly impressed. I had been struggling with my skin for a few months, wondering if it was time to switch birth control or go to a dermatologist, I was at my wit’s end. This has reduced my breakouts significantly. I would consistent get zit after zit until I tried this. I barely break out now, just a small pimple here and there, nowhere close to what I was dealing with prior. Of course, everyone’s skin is different and I have switched up my skincare routine significantly in the last few months, but I really do think that this has helped me quite a bit. Knocked off a star because I feel like you have to add just the right amount of water to get it to froth up the way it should."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Not your typical face wash!!,"I used this at my friends place, and was immediately impressed by how good my skin felt. I bought it, and now it’s a staple in my skin care routine. I even make sure to take it with me when I travel! It works for spot correction, masking and cleansing. Don’t be fooled by the fact that it’s men’s face wash!"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"As someone who has struggled with all sorts of acne (although I don't have cystic acne anymore so I don't know how it would work on that) for years, this is the best face wash I've ever used. Seriously. I use it along with The Ordinary glycolic toner and The Ordinary niacinamide serum mixed with a moisturizer and my face is AMAZING."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"This product is good but I find it can be drying and stripping.  Really gives that squeaky clean feeling that I don't like.  I am no stranger to glycolic products, so that is not the problem.  I received this as a sample.  Initially I really liked it but found that it was too much for everyday use."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,face wash,"It is a good cleanser.It cleans the face completly and doesn't strip the oils from the face.the best thing about it is it has some beads in it,so it will be used as a face wash,scrub and face mask also.I received it as a birthday gift"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,RUN AWAY,"DO NOT PURCHASE.  I have struggled with mild acne for about ten years.  I purchased this based on good reviews, and could not believe what it did to my skin.  My skin broke out EVERYWHERE, in places I never had before, and it seemed to be most concentrated in the places I spent the most time washing.  My acne went from mild to severe in probably about a month, and I STILL have scars from what this cleanser did to me a year later.  STAY AWAY!"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,MEH,Didn't really help with my acne. I didn't really notice benefits from this face wash. Won't repurchase.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"I know this is supposed to be a mens cleanser, but I love it! I use it in the morning to help clean my skin properly. It is super easy to use as a quick mask in the morning, or just use it to scrub your face well."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"Love using it as a mask rather than face scrub. Gets deep in the pores, making your face super smooth and non-drying. Best for sensitive skin."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR OILY/ ACNE PRONE,"I have purchased multiple bottle of this facial cleanser. If you are oily and have acne prone skin, I highly recommend this cleanser. The cleanser is clay and volcanic ash base which helps absorb oil and other impurities. The glycolic and lactic acid present it its formulation helps melt away dead skin cells. As a person who has struggled with acne, i know that you have done research on the causes of acne and how to prevent it. This product addresses the root cause of acne which is clogged pores cause by dead skin cells and sebum."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"Purchased this as a gift for my husband. It's so good, I occasionally use it myself."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,LOVE using this as a mask. Skin feels amazing after using it
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Cleans pores,"I red's this as a sample and immediately knew I had to buy a bottle. I've been struggling with clogged pores and this product is so helpful. It really cleans it and also softens up the skin for extractions. I would say it's slightly on the drying side. Not itchy tight dry but enough that you may want to up your moisturizing game. I've been using argan oil. For reference, I'm on the oily side."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"These have completely changed my skin. I am 33, still have oily skin, large pores in my t-zone and hormonal acne on my jawline monthly. My blackheads are almost gone. I started using this with Cane &a Austin 30% glycolic acid pads and follow with Kate Somerville Anti-Bac. I dab a little moisturizer on as needed. Following this routine once daily (or at night) for two days then skipping a day has been magic."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Awesome cleanser,"Got this cleanser as a deluxe sample and omg I love it so much.  My skin looks so nice after using it - tighter pores, brighter, and matte.  Can also be used as a mask.  May not be for everyday use as it can be a bit drying if left on too long as a mask or used too frequently as a cleanser.  Love that Jack Black is cruelty free!"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Love!,"This is one of my fav face masks/cleansers! I let it sit on my face as a mask 5-10 min (depending on how bad my break out is) then I just lather it up! It leaves my skin feeling so clean and fresh, like your skin can breathe again!"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Ladies too!!!,"Holy Grail Product. My skin likes to act up after waxing, and this stuff keeps the red bumps away wherever I put it. Doubles as a mask, completely amazing for basic exfoliation, blackheads AND any cystic acne that pops up. I am in love."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,perfect face cleanser and unbeatable price,"I received this as a free sample for my birthday a couple years ago and absolutely fell in love with the product. When I went in the store to purchase the full size, that’s when I realized it was actually a men’s cleanser. I have been using this for a while now and only just recently read the back of the bottle & learned that you can use this product as a mask too! You seriously can’t find a better product and especially at that price. I highly recommend this product!! It’s not too rough on the face but enough grains to feel it’s removing dead skin. I’m get tempted by new face washes in prettier containers that end up being triple the price but always come back to this gem. I have oily acne prone skin."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,better as a mask,"I began using this as a cleanser, however it didn’t feel like it was cleaning much. No foam, just a muddy sensation. No scent. Just meh. Then my acne started coming back which right away told me this wasn’t the right cleanser for me. I switched to periodically using this as a face mask instead."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"Not just for men! I've tried the entire gamut of facewashes, from lesser known k-beauty brands to the more high-end stuff that sephora carries. However, this has become my go-to water cleanser as part of my evening skincare routine, I use a different cleanser in the mornings to give my skin a break from the glycolic and mix it up a bit. It has helped  a lot with my cystic acne, love how it foams up and the natural exfoliating texture of the clay."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Best Face Wash I've Ever Used!,WOW. Ladies - I've officially switched from my fancy $100  face wash to this. My skin has never looked this amazing! I always have small little pimples and blackheads on my T-zone and this is made them completely vanish.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,holy grail,"I was interested in trying a product with glycolic acid and bought the travel size. I am 28 and have been having problems with hormonal acne and deep acne that would never go away. This product has saved my skin. However, for about two weeks my skin got worse. After reading more about glycolic acid, I learned that it helps speed up cell turn over which can make your acne worse. The acne that I got came up in my normal trouble areas. Some came to a head and some disappeared. Not only has this helped my stubborn acne but it also gives me a great glow and has helped with scarring. I used to be a girl who would never go anywhere without makeup on my face, now I can venture out with more confidence and radiant skin. I can’t believe I finally found something that worked for me!"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,"Works well and I love the ingredients! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it dries my face out, but other then that it is a great product and does everything else it says in the description!"
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Best thing I’ve ever bought,This is my #1 holy grail skin product. I no longer have oily skin thanks to accutane but when I did it was an absolute lifesaver. It leaves the skin feeling so smooth and clean and makes my pores invisible. I now have normal skin with the odd dry patch and I still use this regularly. It’s great to use in the morning before make up to smooth over the skin and close pores or at night just to replenish. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone no matter skin type.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,Bought for my preteen son acne and it does wonderful.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,it is okay.,"received a birthday gift free, my skin has sensitive and dry. I tried that and little smooth and dry fast. it was okay for me. I think it's perfect for who have oily or combination skin."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,IT WORKS .....,"I have tried SOO many products and this by far beats all! 
I started noticing that I was getting clogged pores. It started from my cheeks, moved on to my forehead and now my jaw line. It was spreading. I couldnt really figure out why this was happening. I figured my cleanser wasnt doing the job right. After reading the reviews I got this cleanser and OMG on about the 3rd day I noticed those under the skin bumps disappear. I convinced my sister to purchase this! Let's see how she enjoys it. It definitely does the job. I noticed it has an exfoliating feel to it, so if you have sensitive skin I'd say work within is gently, which everyone should do anyways. But the exfoliating texture is very minimal! Definitely a product to try if you have texture issues."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,the only stuff that truly works for me,I have incredibly oily skin and this is the only face wash I've ever used that makes my skin feel truly clean all day. My acne even calmed down when I started using it because it cleanses my skin so well.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,FINALLY,"- dont want to jinx anything - buuuuut
this product has been a LIFESAVER. I have spent soooo much money on products to control my breakouts, but nothing was working for me.
There was some products that worked but it absolutely burned and irritated my skin and then there was other products that were so gentle they did nothing.
BUT THIS PRODUCT IS PERFECT. I have been using nothing but this cleanser and my skin has not broken out in weeks! i am so amazed. I am in love with this."
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Oily Skin Ladies..,...This it not just for men! I picked this as my Sephora birthday gift and I am so glad I did. I use it every morning with my Clarisonic and I've noticed a difference in my skin. It's a bit harsh so I would not recommend this for people with sensitive and dry skin.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,Husband loves this,My husband loves this! He uses this as a mask for his face and also all over his body whenever he has any flare ups with blemishes. This calms and soothes the redness and within a couple days the offending blemish is gone.
JACK BLACK-Deep Dive™ Glycolic Facial Cleanser,USA,My son Loves it!!,Finally we found something for his problem of acne and pores.

NUDESTIX-Gentle Hyra-Gel Face Cleanser,Australia,Smooth and Gentle,"As someone who suffers from extremely sensitive skin and eczema I struggle with skincare products but this cleanser is amazing. It doesn’t irritate my skin, it leaves it feeling clean and refreshed with a lovely subtle fragrance. I wish it came it larger sized bottles as I go through it too quickly. It is definitely worth purchasing 2 at a time. "

"
NUDESTIX-Gentle Hyra-Gel Face Cleanser,New Zealand,Gel Cleanser ,"This is a nice and gentle cleanser. It is a gel cleanser that washes the face nicely. If you wear makeup, it will take at least 2 washes and a face cloth to get it off. It only comes with 70mls so this tube only lasted me just over a month. A nice cleanser if you can afford to regularly repurchase. "
NUDESTIX-Gentle Hyra-Gel Face Cleanser,New Zealand,not sure it cleansed at all,"I found this product to be disappointing and didn't appear to cleanse my skin at all, it just washed away. Won't purchase again much prefer other gel cleansers"

SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Malaysia,Ms.,"Wouldn’t recommend for face, as it can get your skin very dried up. It works fine for body. Deep cleansing, yes! But for daily use it can dry up your skin, so better moisturise well after bath. "

SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Australia,wow I'm shook ,to b honest I never thought of use a cake of soap on my face bit I'm so surprised that this doesn't leave my  face feeling over dry like sum beauty soaps 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,Good soap - I just wish I would have realized how small it was. Smells good but it dissolves so fast if left in the shower.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Australia,Sephora Collection soap,"These smell incredible, no argument about that, but they're very small for the price. Sephora has offered good value in the past, but these small soaps - at their current price aren't very good value at all."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Australia,Sephora Collection soap,"I buy this type of item mostly to store away for future gifts & as stocking stuffers at Christmas..... normally Sephora presents quite good value for money.... not in this case though. The bars all smell wonderful, but are extremely small for the price. I recommend buying them on sale...."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Australia,Sephora soap,I like to purchase items like this for future gifts & as stocking stuffers. The size of these measured against the price is quite high. They're very small bars of soap for the price...stars removed for that reason....they do smell nice though
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Australia,Sephora Charcoal soap,"I love the fragrance of the soap, I do believe that for the size of it, the price is quite high.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Malaysia,coconut solid cleanser,I brought this for my husband since he had very sensitive skin .. and almost one month we can see the skin looks good and healthier and can use for more than 3 months I guess .. thank you 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,TINY,This stuff smells amazing but aside from that it’s really nothing special. The photos to me made this look like a normal size bar of soap. When I received it I was surprised to find it was basically a little travel size bar of soap. So the cheap price now doesn’t seem so cheap because it’s not actually an entire bar of soap. So just know when purchasing that these bars are TINY!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,"Use this to clean my face in the shower, does the job. I love it"

SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,New Zealand,Very good,"This is a very good soap that I use on my body. The exfoliating beads aren't that sharp and lightly exfoliate and aren't irritating or annoying. I'm not sure what I expected cactus to smell like but there is no scent, which is nice. It lathers amazingly on a shower puff and lasts a long time. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Great for sensitive skin,"This cleanser cleanser the face! Now, I do have sensitive skin and it’s perfect as it doesn’t break out my face. I will say, if you are looking for a fragrance, this cleanser is not for you as it doesn’t really have one. The fragrance free part is great for sensitive skin. It should also last you for a minute, so it’s worth the money. I would suggest putting on a moisturizer after use as it does tend to dry the skin (after all, it is a cleanser)."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,amazing!!,My favorite cleanser ever. Leaves my skin feeling the cleanest it’s ever been. My skin looks and feels great.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,New Zealand,All Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser - Watermelon ,"This is a great product to use daily, keeps my skin clear and clean. Not much of a scent, great value for money - this lasts a long time! Only negatives are it does sting the eyes and is hard to take away if you are travelling."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,This turned into my new  Favorite facial cleaner fast it does not strip your skin of moisture and it is not perfumed so you don't need to worry about any irritation it is good for all ages and it does a really good job at cleaning your skin. Honestly this is a really good quality shout for a good prize I recommend it to anybody especially those with skin problems . This is also a really good soap for overall use and this will last you a while because it is a hefty concentrated bar.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,Nice that it’s a face and body soap but BARELY smells anything.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Australia,Good face cleanser - just don’t apply directly!,"I’m trying to transition to solid bars for all my shower products and this cactus bar is great. It’s only small so will disappear quickly if used all over, so it’s great just for cleaning my face - as long as I lather it up in my hands then apply it. The little black grains are really coarse and spaced out so the bar is way too rough to use directly on the face, which makes the point of the product a bit silly. But the formula does clean really well, taking off eye makeup without stinging (unlike that dang watermelon bar!) It also has a lovely, subtle green-floral fragrance. Good value as it lasts forever (as a face cleanser). I’d buy it again if it was on sale. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,New Zealand,All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser - Cactus,"This is a nice cost effective cleanser. Good size, and lasts a super long time! Nice neutral smell and fun to use. The cactus bits in the soap can be a bit sharp, so I wouldn’t recommend if you have sensitive skin. Worked well for me and left my skin clean. The only negatives are that it is a little hard to transport if you go away and it does sting if it gets in your eyes. Overall worth it! "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Works well for it's purpose: a cleanser,"I use this to wash my face once a day. It works well for being a basic cleanser. Although it will dry out your face if you have skin prone to dryness like I do. I use an acne moisturizer after, and my face is not dry."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Absolutely Ideal for Traveling!,"I bought 2 of these for traveling, love them cause they’re a lot smaller and easier to pack then both an exfoliater and a cleaner. Smells great, absolutely perfect for what I wanted."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,I bought these in several flavors as stocking stuffers and they were very well received. These are fun and unique cleansers.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Malaysia,amazing ,I've been using it fir so long n it's amazing. I would like to use it again and again. it made my face clear and clear even though. I felt very fresh in these.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Australia,Customer,"Nice scent, it is not too strong and quite natural. Love the ingredients and packaging is cute as well. Not to pricey so perfect as a birthday gift."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Australia,smells good,"Cute little solid soap, smells lovely and does what it says- cleanses without stripping. Great to shave my legs with because I can work up a decent lather and not worry about it drying your skin. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,I absolutely love the cactus one I just bought it and used it less than a week now im waiting for the watermelon one. I love this soap
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,"I got the cactus and the exfoliation felt quite harsh at first, but now I can use it on a daily or every other day basis. It gets the job done!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,New Zealand,Works amazingly ,"This works so well, I was sceptical at first but after using it a few times it defiantly makes my skin feel so soft, clean, and fresh.  It to mention the coconut smell is really nice as well. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Singapore,Not for dry skin,"It’s just normal soap tho… i use on my body only but it’s really tight and drying for me.. imagine if i have used for my face, surely not for face. I also noticed some bumps and feel itchy on my skin."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Australia,cactus,Skin appears clearer once used- suitable for the face just don’t apply bar directly to the face. Face looked so smooth after shower. Would purchase again. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Australia,Must have,This bar of soap is a literal must have! Best bar of soap i have ever had! my skin is so soft and it was really good for my sensitive skin! i would rate this soap
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,"This product is nice, I have sensitive skin and it doesn't harm it in any way. I'd buy this again =)"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Australia,okay ,"well. I felt it's light on the skin, I barely feel any difference on the face when using this.......its just an okay product....the charcoal aoap of sephira is much better than this....."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Australia,good ,this is an amazing soap..... a must buy thing....... you can see it works even after first use......I always loved charcoal face wash now I'm also loving this charcoal soap by Sephora...
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,New Zealand,All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,"I really like the fact that this is a no waste product and has no plastic packaging. This lasted me a long time and is really good value for money. Does a great job of removing makeup and leaves skin feeling clean. Does struggle slightly with waterproof mascara and does sting your eyes! This is really quick and easy to use in the shower however it’s not ideal for taking away. Would recommend trying. Unsure if I would repurchase, but overall definitely a good product. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Not bad at all,"It is not bad, but I am a little disappointed. It is just a normal soap."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Good soap,"This is a nice soap. It smells nice and isn't drying at all. While it's fairly small, it still lasted a long time for me. Definitely worth it if you catch it on sale."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Great soap for dry skin!,Love this product! It smelled great and made my skin feel soft.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,"I used this once and it did not smell like coconut at all. More like sea-food esque.  Not a fan. Maybe will try other scents, but the coconut was a no-go"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,"It’s ok, nothing to write home about however it has a greater lather. Fragrance it’s ok I feel like fro the price it should be larger that’s why it’s not 4 stars. If you actually want to wash your face and bathe with it’s it’s like a 3 day bar max....."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,Great value and good for a travel or all over body cleanser
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,Smells great. I love using this product especially for the face area.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Nice soap,"This bar lasts a long time and it's a nice, gentle soap."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,Really good soap but pretty small. Smells good though!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Small but clean,"I love that this is 98% natural and comes in cardboard packaging. It is a bit small for a body soap but decent size for a facial cleansing bar. As soon as you rinse the bar the surface becomes liquid so a little water will go a long way. The charcoal bar works well as a gentle facial cleanser, however it does not seem to exfoliate well. Also I would recommend moisturizing after using this as it is a bit drying"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Disappointed!!,These are way too small!! For the price I thought it was full size. And the scent is really faint. These are more like hand soaps and not full body.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Great bar,Small but good for the price. Gente with my sensitivo skin and let a fresh sensation.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,I’ve been using this product for about a month and it is amazing I have really sensitive skin and I do only use it for my face
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,love it,"I love this. It’s smells so nice and so refreshing and my skin feels great afterwards. The cactus one is perfect for the dry, desert climate where I live, especially now during the summer."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Love This Soap!!,"I love these soaps! I have tried them all and have repurchased all of them. Yes, the soaps are on the small size but I like the ingredients in this line better than drug store bar soaps."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,"I love this soap!  It smells great, lather is super rich, and it makes my skin so soft.  The bar actually lasts longer than I expected considering the size, and it keeps it’s integrity down to the last tiny stub.  I’ll be a regular buyer of this one!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,"Smaller than I expected, and it made my skin feel dry"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Horrible horrible horrible.,"Bought the watermelon one and it smells like cardboard, it did lather nicely but left me feeling tacky and sticky so I had to use a different body wash to actually feel clean. It has officially been placed in the trash."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Australia,Nice!,"I quite liked this! I bought a couple of these soaps in different varieties to use in the bath/shower. I like the shape, square, and found it to clean as intended. Wasn't drying or irritating. Decent bar of soap!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Australia,Nice,"I bought a couple of these soaps in different varieties to use in the bath/shower. I like the shape, square, and found it to clean as intended. Wasn't drying or irritating. Decent bar of soap!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Australia,A nice soap - that’s all ,"I was excited when this came out because I’m a sucker for all things watermelon. The colour is gorgeous and the fragrance is nice but although it’s meant to be a multipurpose cleanser, I wouldn’t recommend using it on your face. I thought it would be gentle enough but my skin felt a bit dry after using it.  "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Malaysia,natural and smells nice,I'm glad I found smth like this bc its an alternative to using plastic packaging and it also smells good. it's super gentle on the skin too. I lather it on my Lofa but u will probably feel the bumps of the soap if u lather it straight on ur skin but it's not as harsh as u think. I'm adding the charcoal soap into my cart
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Malaysia,Mild and nice coconut scent,First trial of this soap.  Love the mild and nice scent of coconut. Produced sufficient foam and feels soft on my skin. The after effect feels good and not causing any dryness on my skin. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,New Zealand,All Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser - Charcoal ,"I bought this product to be my face cleanser (otherwise it ends up being an overpriced soap). I like the packaging and how there is very minimal waste. Great to use in the shower however does become a bit messy if you use out of the shower or if you want to take it away with you. This removes all makeup and mascara extremely well without the need to double cleanse, although if this gets in or near your eyes it STINGS so badly. Made my eyes hurt for days. It does also seem to be slightly stripping and drying on the skin however it does remove makeup very well. Probably wouldn’t repurchase just because of how much this stings my eyes. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Cute and smells good,Smelled good... I wouldn’t use a bar soap on my face due to spread of Bactria. But for 4$ I’d impulsively grab it again lol. It would make a great stocking stuffer
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Malaysia,Cleanser ,I never have use a bar cleanser on my face... but this cleanser makes my skin clear and smoth..  I use it on my skin at day and night follow with moisturizer
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,New Zealand,Aweswome,I gifted this to my friend she just loved it. Its a good product I will recommend to at least try once. Delivery was also fast and packing was amazing too
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Malaysia,meh,"i love bar soaps but this cactus soap i dont think i can use it on my face because the scrub like seed is so stingly, i am scared to exfoliate my face with this. so i only use this for body, but still it is quite rough for a scrub."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Malaysia,Good gentle soap bar,The soap bar is feeling fresh as you glide it on the skin. There smell is mild and it cleanse gently and does not leave dryness on the skin. This is good entry of a soap that leave moisturised to the skin.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Malaysia,Good soap bar,The soap bar is feeling gentle however the charcoal colour may stain the soap holder. There isn't much smell which is good. It cleanse gently and does not leave dryness on the skin.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Malaysia,Fresh and sweet bar of cleansing,The soap bar is feeling fresh as you glide it on the skin. There smell is nice and sweet which is good. It cleanse gently and does not leave dryness on the skin.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Malaysia,Gentle and exfoliating soap bar,The soap bar has tiny bits that remove the dead cells as you glide it on the skin. There isn't much smell which is good. It cleanse gently and does not leave dryness on the skin.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Australia,Average,"It’s a decent enough cleanser but nothing extraordinary. I find it’s better to lather on your hands then apply to face since if you rub the bar directly on your face it feels really scratchy (I use this for face only, did try on the body but skin always felt weird after)"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Australia,Scratchy and a bit meh,"I had high hopes for this soap, but I found myself needing to use a second soap with it every time. the exfoliating particles are just so big that the soap part gets lost and doesn't lather. and they don't so much exfoliate as scratch you. I won't be ordering this particular soap again but I do like the sephora range generally so it was a bit of a let down"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,I love it! Feels clean and leaves skin soft. Small bar wish it was bigger. But I will be purchasing this soap for now on.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Too small,To small..I mean never seen a soap so small....it looks nice wrapped..but not yet tested..looks like a sample
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,You Get What You Pay For,It's Okay however it left my skin a bit dry and sensitive. Their did seem to be a lot of fragrance in it a swell. So I guess what you pay for.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,bang for buck,"for the price, this little bat can't be beat! it's lasting a really long time.  had it almost 3 weeks & very little depletion of the bar. mild sudsy soft lather  & nice hint of milky coconut.  deal of the day!!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Malaysia,Nice ,"This is great for travel as a two-in-one product, though i have been using it more as a body soap than a face cleanser. The scent is mild, and pleasant (doesnt smell like watermelon though) and my body does feel quite refreashed after using it. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Sephora Collection All-Over Face &amp; Body Solid Cleanser - Coconut Milk,"Kind of expected this to be a little bigger but other than that it is what it is. Decent soap, leaves a super clean feeling without drying, ingredients look pretty good. The smell on mine was very light, if you like that. Great price, would buy again, probably not the same scent though."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,USA,Not to shabby. Soft scent,"Enjoyed using this little soap. I usually go go liquid soap and body wash but I'm quite happy with this and it's not drying for my body at all. I've not used it on my face, but I'm sure it would still be great. Smell is subtle yet fresh. I went ahead and ordered a few more. I've used it daily now for a few weeks and still have more to use, even if it's small, it lasts a while."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Malaysia,Okay,The soap is okay overall. I did not see much difference on my face while using it for 2 weeks. But needs improvment. I understand it is a new product but I would still purchase another brand items of sephora like the hand and feet mask. Overall okay. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Malaysia,very cute,"whats not to love about this soap? its very cute, the colour is cute, the smell is cute, it works wonder like any other soap, with extra cuteness. oh, the price is also really2 cute. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Philippines,smells nice but not worth it,"This is really expensive for just a nice-smelling soap. It’s tiny and from what i can tell, doesn’t do more than cleanse your skin (which is the point, but so many other products can do it better and cheaper). "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-All-Over Face & Body Solid Cleanser,Philippines,just ok,Not sure why people are raving over this in the review section. It’s just soap. It smells nice and cleans the skin but doesn’t do anything special. There are little bumps on this one which i guess helps to exfoliate the skin but definitely not enough to do it better than other exfoliants. 
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Spa In A Bottle,"When I first used this cleanser, it seemed to refresh my entire body. Thinking it was just my imagination I used it again the next day, and I literally felt my facial muscles and BODY relax. If you want a true spa experience you need this."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Must Have!!,"Love this!! Don’t really write reviews but I had to for this product just in case anyone is feeling skeptical like I was. Get it! I absolutely love it after applying it gives a tingling sensation, washed it off & my face felt sooo soft omg!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,OK cleanser,OK cleanser. Have been using for over a month and haven't noticed substantial improvements in my skin. More like keeping it up. Not the best pore cleanser and almost acts as a first cleanser (that's how gentle it is). This doesn't completely make the skin tight after washing but there is some dryness. Overall hasn't done much to improve oiliness or give the skin a complete transformation. Simply just an ok cleanser. Seems to improve redness and doesn't cause irritation - but not a miracle worker. Would recommend if you have normal skin and clogged pores aren't your concern.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Highly recommended,"This is my 3rd product from Kora and it’s another 5/5. I struggled to find a product that makes my skin feel clean but not doesn’t strip all the moisture from it. This is great, it’s refreshing, cleansing and my skin doesn’t feel taught and uncomfortable after use. I’m in my 50’s, have dry skin and highly recommend it."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Great!,"my favorite type of cleanser is foaming. This one is great, and works well for my dry skin, it doesn’t feel any drier after using it and also it effectively removes make up! Turmeric doesn’t color your skin, I was a bit concerned about that."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,"I received the Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser from KORA Organics. I have combination skin. This cleanser really nicely cleanses my skin, without leaving that tight feeling. I was surprised to see that aloe is the first ingredient, which is very soothing for skin. I also love turmeric since it gives my skin a natural, subtle tint and glow.My skin was left cleansed while still retaining some moisture."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,This is a very lovely and refreshing face wash.  It feels very smooth on my skin with a bit of what I can only describe as a tingly clean feel as you use it.  It perked my skin right up after using it.  I liked the scent too - it’s definitely heavy on mint from the peppermint oil mixed with a nice blend of fresh herbs / florals.   I was surprised by how much I liked this one.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Middle of the Road,"I am a Noni Oil stan! Like, holy grail of facial oils and will dramatically change your skincare routine. I’ll be honest, this cleanser isn’t anything special. Used morning and night for 2 weeks, I saw no major changes in my skin. I wasn’t expecting to either. Changes in skin take a minimum of 4 weeks (or one skin cell turnover cycle). 
My skin wasn’t stripped and I didn’t notice any new breakouts, so there are some positives. Overall, it’s a nice-to-have and not necessarily a need-to-have for me. Still will forever use the oil ;)"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Great cleanser!!,"What a unique cleanser I have ever tried! Besides it being Clean and organic,  I really like the main ingredients that it has which is the Turmeric. We all know the good benefits of it. I also like that it does not have the odor surprisingly. It lathers perfectly and did not stripped my skin. Packaging is so nice & sturdy! I am obsessed!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,Canada,love!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I was initially apprehensive to try the product as I was afraid that there would be a high turmeric fragrance, however I was pleasantly surprised with this cleanser. It lathers well, does not have a turmeric odor, and does a great job of cleansing skin without feeling like it's been stripped. I will say, for those with sensitive skin, there is peppermint oil in the formula which leaves the skin with that ""fresh"" feeling which I personally like, however may not be for those with fragrance-sensitive skin. Almost done my 1st bottle!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,I’m very impressed with this cleanser! One of the new favorites in my morning routine! It smells so refreshing and feels incredibly gentle to the skin while leaving it perfectly purified and smooth without stripping. Absolutely love it!
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Refreshing,This is a cleanser unlike any other. I was skeptical because of the price. I was gifted this product but even still. I am quite happy with it I think the hefty price comes with how cute and sturdy the packaging is. It is a glass. The peppermint oil gives the product a nice refreshing feeling to the face. I used 4 pumps when using this product. t makes my pores look non existent. I would recommend but I am giving it 4 stars out of 5 for the price.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,"I’m obsessed! This is one of the best cleansers I have ever tried. It has a cooling/ refreshing feeling, and after few days of use I can already tell the difference on my skin. The packaging is beautiful and luxurious! I would 100% recommend."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Minty Fresh!,"Growing up in an Asian household, my mom was always enthusiastic about turmeric in skin care since it helps brightens up discoloration/dark spots. I am a huge fan of gel texture skin products and this product is definitely high up there! I use just two pumps and that is perfect for my skin. It lathers very nicely and it is SO refreshing! Leaves my skin feeling so clean and soft. I love to use it in the morning because of the minty freshness!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,glow skin,"I received this facial cleanser complimentary from Kira Organics ! The gel has a very mild fragrance. My skin came up, there was no redness and dryness. I wash it twice a day. Washes off makeup well. I recommend"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,This is the first time ever using Kora organic products and I loved it so much.This cleanser’s scent reminds me of Jacq's cleanser but the effectiveness is better. It is a great cleanser that doesn't leave my skin feeling too dry after.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Love LOVE this cleanser!,"I’m very picky when it comes to cleansers, having an oily skin - I expect my cleanser to really clean - and this cleanser does it oh so well! It’s a gel cleanser, with a VERY refreshing minty smell which I absolutely love, and it feels very cooling on the skin and invigorating! My skin feels super clean and cool and FRESH after using this cleanser!! Also extra points on the beautiful glass bottle, it looks so pretty on my sink!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,"As an Asian, turmeric is an ingredient I used growing up with. I used turmeric for almost every skin concern. I am glad to see the inclusion of turmeric and other natural ingredients in this cleanser. The scent of this cleanser is so refreshing. This cleanser lathered up really well and left the skin smooth without any tightness."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Smells amazing!,"I usually am skeptical of natural skin care brands because I’ve done my research on how they can be harsh for sensitive skin like mine. However, this was a pleasant surprise for me! I loved the scent, the way it lathered, made my skin feel nourished and not tight, and ultimately really cleaned my skin. I personally find it to be a bit more expensive for a cleanser, but if you want to splurge on something nice for yourself this is definitely the route to go!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Awesome cleanser,"Loving this kora cleanser so much. It has a lightweight serum feel to it that cleanses my makeup off well, doesn't leave my skin feeling tight afterwards, and leaves me feeling refreshed due to the subtle minty scent. You get quite a lot of product for the price too. This bottle will go a long way. My skin has been glowing since using this so I will be purchasing again. Highly recommend."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,"This is such an interesting product. This cleanser’s scent reminds me of Ricola cough drops. It’s a gel texture and lathers easily. When I massage the cleanser onto my skin for a good cleanser, there’s a bit of a menthol like affect. Like when I wash off the cleanser with cold water, it doesn’t even feel cold? It’s a bit hard to explain to be honest! It’s a decent cleanser but I do feel like it’s quite expensive for what it is."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Has a refreshing feeling,"This is the first time ever using Kora organic products and I liked it. I have very sensitive dry skin and this cleanser gives nice refreshing feeling afterwards but honestly I would choose to clean my face with this cleanser 2-3 times a week, no more than that."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,I love how beautiful all Kora Organics products are. This one is quite nice. I love that it is vegan and clean. This is a great cleanser that doesn't leave my skin feeling too dry after. Look forward to using this more!
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Not the best,"didn’t love this as a facial cleanser, it almost had a tingly feeling when using. I don’t think the extracts played well with my skin. The consistency is very nice and washes off easily. I ended up using this primarily on my body to help get through the bottle."

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Just need a little!,"I’m obsessed! I love the fact that a little goes such a long way with the foaming technology.

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,"This was a very nice face wash. Had a great lather which lasts nicely during a 2 minute straight face wash. Be careful with this product though getting into your eyes because of the peppermint oils. Other than that, very nice product."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,"I was a little disappointed when unboxing as the cap wasn’t on properly and some face wash came out covering the bottle and box.

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Love how it foams up,I really love this cleanser. It’s super refreshing with  a minty scent and leaves my skin with a refreshing tingle. I will say I can’t scrub my eye makeup off with this as the eucalyptus/mint can bother my  eyes a bit (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) but as long as I use eye make up remover first and then wash my face with this it’s great. I love how it foams up and it cleans really well without leaving my skin feeling dry. Overall I love it and recommend it.

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,leaves my face feeling super refreshed and cool,"super refreshing cleanser - wasn't expecting the cooling sensation to be so strong, it's almost like when you use charcoal or tea tree oil on your scalp and the cooling feeling lingers for some time after cleansing. i really like the way it thickens up as i cleanse and it leaves my face feeling super clean and refreshed. i use this as my second cleanser at night! super generous amount and will last me a while so i'd say it's worth the price for the volume!"

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Best cleanser I’ve tried in a while!,"Finally a good foaming cleanser from Kora! I used to use their old foaming cleanser that came in a blue tube, but that one didn’t really foam that much and it didn’t really offer the best cleanse. Then I used the cream cleanser and it wasn’t that great…was moisturising but it didn’t remove my makeup well. This one…absolutely amazing! Foams up nicely, cleanses well, feels so nice and refreshing on my skin with the peppermint oil, and my skin feels so velvety smooth afterwards. It also smells great…slightly floral but very minty. Also, the glass packaging and the ingredients are a plus!"

This has a nice thin gel texture that I enjoy, but be warned that there is an intense cooling/peppermint scent and effect. This is not comfortable around the eyes. But it does not irritate my skin other than my eyes."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Good for combination skin,I’ve been using lora face wash for 2 weeks. Feels smooth on the skin and leave my skin very clean.

Complimentary from Kora Organics."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,"A nice cleanser, just not for me","I have loved all of the Kora Organics products I have tried - moisturizer, oil, mask, etc. - but sadly this cleanser just isn’t for me.  It has lovely, hefty glass packaging.  I just worry it will slip and break.  The formula is foaming but not so foamy that I’m overwhelmed by bubbles.  It washes off easily.  It is meant to purify, cleanse, and nourish.  I can feel the purify and cleansing aspects.  I have dry skin so usually go for cream cleansers.  This is a little more stripping than a cream but not so much so that my skin feels tight or irritated.  My biggest issue is the menthol like fragrance and feel from ingredients like peppermint and rosemary oils.  Yes, it is “invigorating” but I can’t get it anywhere near my eyes."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,I just started using this cleanser from kora organics but I've really been enjoying it so far.

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,it tingles,This is my first time trying the Kora foaming cleanser. I love the lather of the product and how it removes my makeup but the only thing I can't handle is the peppermint-like scent and tingle in my face after I use it. If they didn't have that ingredient I would love the product

I cleanse morning and night and my skin feels so smooth and clean afterwards. I like that I can barely need to use a lot to cover my face and it also smells great!
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Note: Minty!,"This cleanser has been a great second cleanse for me in my evening routine. It suds up to a nice foam and is easy to rinse off. My skin never feels dry or stripped after using which is always a plus. However, there's not enough focus on the fact that this product is minty, which I wasn't really expecting. It has a peppermint scent and makes your face feel really cold after drying off because of the mint. It feels nice for summer, but I don't think I'd like using this in the winter.  Overall, it's a really great product though and I will definitely be getting this for my summer routine!"

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Surprisingly minty,"I use 2 pumps of this cleanser and apply to a wet face. It creates a nice lather when emulsified with water, and rinses off nicely. It doesn’t strip my skin and make it feel dry/taut.

I love how the pump dispenses the perfect amount of cleanser. The smell is fresh & minty and the cleanser foams up immediately. During and after application, it leaves skin feeling minty fresh with a relaxing cooling sensation. This product leaves my skin feeling amazing, all traces of makeup were successfully removed, and my skin felt rejuvenated. Afterwards, my skin felt firm yet moisturized.

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,"Great cleanser! Gentle enough to be used everyday but very effective at the same time. The cleanser is a lightweight watery gel, and you only need two pumps max for the whole face, so it’s going to last a while. I really like how easily it lathers up and how it feels on my skin. It feels a little tingly and gives this cooling sensation, which is not only very pleasant, but it also helps me wake up in the morning. I always use 2-step process when removing makeup but I did use this cleanser one time without using oil prior to it, and it removed most of my makeup really well!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,INCREDIBLE,"Truly blown away. This is the softest most clean my face has ever felt! My face also feels hydrated, not stripped. It bubbles up beautifully, just perfection honestly. The packaging is also gorgeous, high quality glass with a pump!

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,"I was pretty surprised by this. The packaging is cute but arrived with a damaged pump. I was able to fix it myself. It lathers quite well and effectively cleans my skin. It is very very minty and my whole face went instantly red. This subsided quickly and my skin did feel soft and supple, but I just wanted expecting some much mint initially. If you do not have sensitivities; this is a good cleanser."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Turmeric Glow Foaming Cleanser,USA,Love this Miranda!!,"I absolutely love that this product makes my skin feel clean and refreshed but NOT stripped and dry.

BURT'S BEES-Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser,Singapore,AVERAGE CLEANSER ,BURT'S BEES - Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser is a normal cleanser and I don't find anything special about it. I think it is reasonably priced and serves its purpose. 
BURT'S BEES-Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser,,worst product!,"This is the Worst product I’ve ever used! It doesn’t cleanse well, clogged pores and caused breakouts! It doesn’t leave skin with a hydrating feeling but a tight and squeaky feeling, yet not well cleanse! I dumped it to the bin and wasted my money after 2 times usage. Will never repurchase and never recommend to anyone!"
BURT'S BEES-Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser,,great,Bought it for mom and she loves it. It doesn't strip off all the oil from the skin. After using it the skin doesn't feels dry. It feels kinda nice. The smell is good. 
BURT'S BEES-Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser,,as expected,gentle and hydrating. good alternative to a milk cleanser. lasted about 3 months with twice daily usage. i used this together with the intense hydration moisturiser and they both worked well
BURT'S BEES-Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser,,Fave cream cleanser!,"I tried this because it is one of the cheapest trusted-brand cream cleanser available in the market. I have dry combination and eczema prone skin. This cream cleanser really hydrates my skin. It doesn’t suck the moisture out of my skin to the point I’m Rushing to put on my moisturiser. Though it is not great in removing makeup (especially non-waterproof mascara), I noticed how daily use of this one made my skin more plump and healthy looking. Will definitely repurchase!"
BURT'S BEES-Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser,,Good for hydration,This cleanser gives me enough hydration. No more dry skin. But I feel its not 'strong' enough to clean all the dirt. So I use it in the morning instead as my face are free from makeup at that time :)
BURT'S BEES-Intense Hydration Cream Cleanser,,Sticking to this cleanser!,A bit upset when Burt Bee is closing down in Malaysia. Luckily it is still restock by Sephora. Am restocking a few of this before it runs out of stock again. It is the only cleanser that will not dry out my sensitive skin. Will continue to repurchase again and again. Pls do not make it out of stock.
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,Malaysia,sting a bit,the smell is really sharp and when i applied near my eyes it will sting a little bit. it does gives the hydrating after cleansed and the volume is worth the money. i am not sure i will repurchase this
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,Singapore,not a fan of the smell ,"It’s an ok product, nothing fancy but at least it does not break up for me and with sensitive skin I was afraid it might… I’d recommend for the price but will probably not get again "
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,Malaysia,okay and just okay,"Okay. Not much difference i notice. Very mild effects. Can be used for teenagers or sensitive skin. For me, i prefer more powerful cleanser with different texture. "
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,Singapore,Break out,"It cause break out. And the pimple quite painful. I used it twice, just that the break out getting more. I have stop using it. And get my spouse to use it as well, also my spouse having breakout. So not too sure of the product or our skin. But i wont be buying it."
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,Malaysia,cleans but stings,Bought this during promo as the price was affordable and the size is quite big. It cleans well but it does have a “sting feeling” and may not be suitable for sensitive skin. Will not purchase again
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,Malaysia,too drying,Cleans well but very drying. Skin feels really tight after rinsing. Caused breakout for my skin. Bought in during sale. Now I understand why are they on sale
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,Malaysia,"Not bad, affordable","Got this during sales. First time using this brand for cleansing. Have wanted to try this brand for the longest time and finally got it during big sales. Not bad, price is affordable. "
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,Malaysia,hmm,"Well I don’t hate it but I don’t love it 
I don’t think it suits my skin, after using it my skin feels itchy and it gave me acne even though it feels fresh And clean when applying so I’m confused about this product "
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,Malaysia,cleanser suitable for sensitive skin,Love this cleanser. Super gentle on my sensitive skin. Didn’t cause me break out. My skin feels clean and soft after using. I would recommend it to everyone with or without sensitive skin. A basic cleanser for all skin type. 
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,Singapore,holy grail!,this product is definitely going into my holy grail list. it cleans my face without stripping my skin because of it’s hydration. i especially love love love the minty cooling effect as i’m washing my face with this cleanser. 
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,,My favourite ,My go-to cleanser in the morning. I just love the smell of this cleanser and the cool minty feeling - really awakens me in the morning. I don't know what it is but I just love the smell of this cleanser.
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,,pretty pricy ,"Not much different. I chose for oily face but it is not bad as a facial foam but no impact to skin and no extra effect. Just normal facial foam.i don’t think I will buy again.
"
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,,love this!,"i've almost used up the whole tube and i love it. it has a cool feeling when it touches the skin ans doesnt have a strong scent to it.

since i started using the cleanser, i've been having less breakouts and it's really gentle but thoroughly cleans the skin. 

i actually recommended this to my cousin and she also loves it. "
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,,love the smell ,I love the smell of it everytime I use it to wash my face. It leaves a very cooling feeling making it feel clean and fresh. I would definitely buy this item again. 
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,,hydrating cleanser,"This is by far the best cleanser I’ve tried. It hydrates my face, price is reasonable, pleasant smell, and doesn’t leave a tingly feeling after wash( dry skin). Only complaint is that it has the minty alcohol, which stings my eyes, hence the 3.5 stars.

"
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,,not suitable for me..,"Was wanting to try something more natural so I picked this up. I think it cleanses well but i hate the feeling of cold after i wash my skin, it burns my skin, and I really don't see that much improvement in my skin after using it and it felt really dry. will stick to my physiogel cleanser "
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,,great for dry skin,It's very creamy and leaves skin smooth and plump. Doesn't have tight-after-wash feeling. Big packaging and a little goes a long way with this product. Highly recommend this! Just wished they're more easily available in-stores. 
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,,not too bad,"can definitely feel the minty feel on my face. quite refreshing after washing. cleaner smells great as well. Cleansing properties wise, not too sure since its cream base, which doesn't work the same way as foam cleanser."
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,,chamomile face wash,"I love this product!! First of all, it's a very good price for its size. The chamomile scent is calming and relaxing. The soap itself cleanses very well despite having no exfoliant beads, etc. The minty cooling menthol effect after washing face is very pleasant and my favourite part of this face wash. The minty effect is just right, it's not too cooling. Love this. Will be repurchasing it."
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,,nice,"I’ve bought it 2 times now .it is very good it have the mint feels when you wash with thus product and its working for me .so im going to keep using it .but please have it in store product .rather than to have purchased it on line

"
BURT'S BEES-Soap Bark & Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream,,So-So,I have to say I am quite dissapointed in this cleanser. At first I am fascinated at how the cleanser has a minty effect on my skin. But I notice after a month it did no significant improvement to my skin. 
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil Duo,Singapore,Bobbi Brown cleaning oil ,Is a very good due and good products but without this promotion it’s too costly. Although It seem to be very oily but surprisingly it’s not and very clean . Will recommend to friends and family. Thank you!
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil Duo,Singapore,great deal,Found out this great deal of cleansing oil at sephora and bought it without hesitation. This cleansing oil manage to remove makeup and still keep face clean and moisture
BOBBI BROWN-Soothing Cleansing Oil Duo,Singapore,Bobbi Brown Soothint Cleansing Oil Duo,Very good deal! Removes all traces of makeup and does not leave the skin oily. Very good product but it’s rather pricey for 200ml. However will definitely repurchase the again.

SULWHASOO-Snowise Brightening Cleansing Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Good ,"All the cleansing products from sulwhasoo are great, I use this together with the gentle cleansing foam and does a good job of removing makeup without drying up the skin. "
SULWHASOO-Snowise Brightening Cleansing Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,:/ won’t repurchase ,Always had combination skin. This product Dried out my face and my dried out face ended up producing more oil which made me need to wash more and when I wash my face more with the cleanser it dries more which leads to a vicious cycle. Therefore I won’t repurchase. This is my first Sulwhasoo product. It’s quite drying. I might not purchase from this brand again. 
SULWHASOO-Snowise Brightening Cleansing Foam Facial Cleanser,Singapore,smooth and gentle cleanser,"Highly recommend for those who have oily skin..this foam really soft and gentle to the skin.
Im in love with the soft foam.and yess u cant see the results in a while…but at least its make my skin look better than before.
"
SAND & SKY-Australian Pink Clay - Deep Pore Cleanser,Singapore,Great substitute if you don't have time for their clay mask,"I've tried their start product -pink clay mask, and I must say I prefer this as it can be used daily, more gentle and gives similar effects! Both products use similar ingredients..have the same smell too! I don't feel my skin is as dry compared to using the clay mask. I feel that my pores seem to be less obvious and my complexion brightening up! I'm on my 2nd tube now! "

OLE HENRIKSEN-Splashing Stars Cleanser & Scrub Duo,Malaysia,average products,"I was looking for new skin care brand and this was a good chance to try out. The cleanser is ok, gentle to skin but nothing else. As for the scrub, while being nice to my skin, I didn't feel like it is really exfoliating. They're curr, have nice smell, and won't harm your skin. That's all"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Splashing Stars Cleanser & Scrub Duo,Philippines,Great Duo!,This is a great way to their facial duo! Been wanting to test out their cleanser and scrub especially I’m running out of scrub. Got this on sale and is such a steal! And the size is also perfect for travel! 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Splashing Stars Cleanser & Scrub Duo,Singapore,stripping quality ,The soap was a lot on pressing the tube. And the end effect is rather drying. The scrub was ok and had a nice scent to it. So the scrub was the redeeming one. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Splashing Stars Cleanser & Scrub Duo,Malaysia,good value,"Love both of the products, this is a good set to try out, face wash very gentle and smells subtle orange, very refreshing. The face scrub might be too harsh for some people, but i like it. It feels really like it does the job of scrubbing the dead skin cells, face feels really smooth afterwards."

OLE HENRIKSEN-Splashing Stars Cleanser & Scrub Duo,Singapore,Ms,"i bought this when it was on sale for $23-24 so it was really worth the price! Cleanser worked well, smells really good, it was not drying for my face at all (sensitive skin), face was soft after usage. The scrub was harsher than i thought but it’s okay if you use less force while washing ur face, leaves face soft and smooth!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Splashing Stars Cleanser & Scrub Duo,Singapore,ole ole!,i love the lemon scrub which i have gone and purchased the bigger version now. have not tried the facial cleanser as waiting to take that on trips. the scrub contains AHA which is good to use for brightening. this and the AHA toner in great combination together
OLE HENRIKSEN-Splashing Stars Cleanser & Scrub Duo,Australia,MUA,I really wanted to try Ole Henrikson products so when I saw these at Christmas I couldn’t resist. I loved all products and have repurchased the moisturiser. I am still using the scrub. A little goes a long way.

OLE HENRIKSEN-Splashing Stars Cleanser & Scrub Duo,Singapore,Pretty good ,"First time trying the brand of this scrub . The scrub bits are not the teeny weeny but to be surprise my skin did not react to it . Still pretty gentle on skin , and smells heavenly too . Yet to try their cleanser but I trust it shouldn’t weigh far off . Wouldn’t mind purchasing them again "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Splashing Stars Cleanser & Scrub Duo,USA,Ole Henriksen Splashing Stars Cleanser &amp; Scrub Duo,I’m giving it 1/5 because the product were so little and we’re half full! So not worth any money
OLE HENRIKSEN-Splashing Stars Cleanser & Scrub Duo,Malaysia,Christmas gift ,Bought this for a friend as Christmas’s present. Suitable for traveling and we discuss about this brands so a while and read the review. I am please that he is pleased with it 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Splashing Stars Cleanser & Scrub Duo,Singapore,Super good cleanser and scrub for face ,"It’s really my favourite cleanser as it smell like oranges and very calming to the skin, the scrub is lemon smell and very good to exfoliate due to its mini exfoliate beads inside, love how my skin feels after using both. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Splashing Stars Cleanser & Scrub Duo,Australia,love these ,I love the smell of both these products. the scrub is a great texture and leaves my skin soft and clean. My skin definitely looks brighter and more youthful using these products 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Splashing Stars Cleanser & Scrub Duo,Australia,Not as great as I hoped,"The truth juice cleanser is really nice and mild, but the lemon scrub was a very very intense exfoliator and made me breakout. I will persevere as my skin would need to get used to it, but not my fave. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Splashing Stars Cleanser & Scrub Duo,USA,My New Skincare Routine Favorites!,"Lemonade Smoothing scrub feels so nice on my skin. I use about twice a week. 

The Orange Fruit Water (Truth Juice Daily Cleanser) is my favorite of the duo even though I bought it for the scrub! The smell of this cleanser alone makes it feel refreshing. The texture of the product is also smooth and lathers really well."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Splashing Stars Cleanser & Scrub Duo,Malaysia,Lit from Within,"This star cleanser and scrub duo is so worthy to purchase. It's an average exfoliating scrub, not too harsh. Smells v good if you love lemon and citrus!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Splashing Stars Cleanser & Scrub Duo,Malaysia,Testing,First time buying this duo set. Got it for 20% off. And got some mini trial products too. Anything that smell of lemons and oranges is definitely a must try! Let's see how good these are!!
LAURA MERCIER-Skin Essentials Collection,Singapore,Laura Mercier Basic Set,"Thanks to this Laura Mercier 4 pcs set, it started my LM journey, thereafter buying & using the translucent loose powder & brushes. lash curler is also another must buy, uts so professionally curled too."
LAURA MERCIER-Skin Essentials Collection,Singapore,great starter kit ,cleanser and micellar water are full sized. moisturiser and eye cream are so tiny!! starter kit is affordable and i’m so excited to try! heard good reviews about it 
BYBI BEAUTY-Crystal Clear Gel Cleanser,Australia,😔,"unfortunately this product didn't suit my skin at all it made my face looks more oily and itchy, pimples straight away I threw it away I don't use it maybe it suits for people who have dry/normal skin I have oily skin maybe for this reason it didn't suit my skin"
BYBI BEAUTY-Crystal Clear Gel Cleanser,,Great Cleanser!,I love this - it's a really nice gel texture and foams up so you get that squeeky clean feeling but it's not drying and stripping. I love the smell it's a bit medicinal and minty.
BYBI BEAUTY-Crystal Clear Gel Cleanser,,not value for money,"for just 60ml, the price point is a bit high. I bought it because of the unique ingredients but I dont see much difference in my skin. bybi uses eco friendly material for their packaging which I appreciate but i don't like the dispensing of the cleanser from this tube packaging. sometimes too little comes out, sometimes too much"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Heavy glass bottle,Selecting a heavy tall glass bottle for a cleanser is peculiar design choice. This bottle gets slippery when you WASH YOUR FACE. Mine smashed to the ground after a handful of uses. Think long and hard before you buy this because cleaning it up after it breaks is a major bummer.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,Not worth the price IMO. It’s gentle but doesn’t take off the very little eye makeup I wear even with a second wash. Would have expected more for the price/hype  and I have other equally gentle cleansers that I feel work better. Will be switching back to Fresh’s Soy cleanser or Shishedo’s cleansing oil after this (both of which I like more and take off all my makeup easily).
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Gentle Touch,It feels gentle on your skin. A small amount goes a long way! Your skin feels hydrated through out the day!
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,Canada,best cleanser I’ve used,"This is gentle, but it cleans well. I use 3 pumps at night and 2 in morning. It removes eye makeup, leaves skin feeling fresh. I find it lathers very minimally. Wonderful stuff."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,"Repeated purchase. Will continue to buy, worth the price tag. Leaves face feeling smooth and clean."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,Canada,Better cleansers available - doesn’t lather,Looks great. Feels great but doesn’t really clean. I don’t have time for triple cleansing. I don’t wear make up either.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Great cleanser!!!,"At first I wasn’t sure, now I can’t live without this cleanser. I use all my AB products in the AM. The change my skin has seen is amazing.  Gets your face clean and feels soft and hydrated."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,"my new favorite cleanser, ever.","I've just finished my first bottle of this cleanser..time to review! I have been using another good cleanser for years, still love that one. I absolutely love Augustinus Bader products so I decided to try this one. It has a very medical grade type of smell, that is not unpleasant. I actually prefer cleansers to not have much fragrance anyway. I use my Shiseido face brush and massage it in and let it sit for one minute and rinse. Not only does my skin feel amazingly smooth and clean, it has ABSOLUTELY cut down on my breakouts, soothes the blemishes I already have, my skin is clear and radiant in a way I did not notice before using this cleanser. A must have, I absolutely love it and is my new holy grail."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,The best cleanser I’be tried,"Absolutely love this cleanser! It leaves the skin so soft. I have oily/combination skin but prefer gentle cleansers that would not dry the skin out. This one is perfect! I noticed that even the skin around my eyes feels very soft after cleansing my face, no cleanser I used before was able to deliver such result. I don’t think this cleanser drastically improves the skin tone over time but the skin looks calm and hydrated after washing the face"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,Canada,Gentle but doesn’t clean well,"I like this wash because it’s gentle and doesn’t break me out or agitate my combo skin. However, it doesn’t really clean your face that well. I washed off light bronzer and cream blush. I used a peel after and it just picked up too much it left behind. Great if you double cleanse daily. (See photo for residue picked up with BHA post cleanse)"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Love,"This cream feels wonderful on the skin, it lathers well and a little goes a long way. My skin didn’t feel tight and dry after using but it did feel clean and refreshed."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Leaves skin so smooth and soft!,"As usual, I've waited till the last possible minute to write this review. I prefer to make sure I am giving products the opportunity to perform as  promised.


While The Cream Cleansing Gel doesn't take off my makeup well, in all other ways, I am a big fan of this cleanser's capabilities. I use it at night after working remotely and not wearing makeup. It's soothing to my skin, and in conjunction with Augustinus Bader's The Cream, leaves my skin feeling smooth and supple.


One thing I hate about certain cleansers and soaps is when they give you that squeaky clean feeling. Like there's a film on top of your skin that grips things. It's the worst! That said, The Cream Cleansing Gel is not like that at all! About 2 pumps work for my whole face. I lather a little in my hand, rub on my face using gentle circular motions, then rinse with warm water. Contending with makeup in the TX heat means I have to do a double cleanse at times. I really enjoy this as the 2ndary cleanser to leave my skin feeling exactly as I want before applying my evening serums and moisturizer.


The results seem to be more pronounced now that I'm using it in conjunction with The Cream. They work well in tandem together as a skincare system (symbiotic ingredients I'm gathering).


Very happy with this cleanser and I still have a ton left! It's a higher price tag item but it does deliver on minimizing pore size, evening out texture, and boosting radiance. Plus it's evident that my skin is being pampered, which I love!"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Cleanliness Worth the Price,"I was immediately impressed with The Cream Cleansing Gel. It didn’t take me a  full two months of sampling before making that conclusion. I can’t say that very often about a facial cleanser. Firstly, it has no scent, which leads me to believe they’re not adding any extra ingredients. Because of this, I believe it could be suitable for someone with sensitive skin. A little goes a long way from this beautiful bottle. Two, maybe three pumps is all you need for the soft luxurious lather. By no means after using this did my skin feel tight and stripped. It felt soft, moisturized but not greasy and overall CLEAN. Very impressive for a facial cleanser. I used this in conjunction with the Augustinus Bader The Cream moisturizer. When using the two products together, my skin felt immediately firmer, lifted, and evenly moisturized. I used The Cream a couple of times without using the Cleansing Gel and I noticed The Cream “pill” a bit while applying, which leads me to believe that The Cleansing Gel has something extra or no extra that can’t be found in other cleansers in the same price point. I have continued to use this cleanser since sampling for two months because I love the way my skin feels. I’ll also probably purchase this when I run out, which won’t be for quite a while. Overall an exceptional product and well worth the price."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,My face definitely felt refreshed and clean after using this cleanser. I really loved how well it lathered before it was applied to my face. A little goes a long way and this bottle will last for a while. The packaging is luxurious as well.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,Canada,Not special enough to justify the price,"It’s a very, very good cleanser - moisturizing without being oily, and my face felt clean but not stripped after using. But, at this price, it’s not that much better than cerave’s moisturizing cleanser. 

I’m not a particularly price sensitive customer, and their moisturizer has changed my skin - I love this brand. But the cleanser isn’t special enough for me to keep purchasing. It’s just not a smart buy."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Best Thing Ever,"I’m very difficult to impress with skincare products. I’ve seen every miracle claim you can imagine and they’ve all fallen flat-until I tried this stuff 

In the interest of full disclosure, I received this cleanser for free through Influenster. I’d have never dreamed of spending this much on face wash, but I’m going to from now on. 

To start off, this stuff makes you feel really elegant when you use it. The bottle is made of really pretty cobalt blue glass and makes you feel really fancy and well bred. This initially freaked me out, but it’s really heavy duty and has survived a couple tumbles. 

This awesome wash dispenses a tiny amount of product, which is fine because you barely need any to clean your face. Like, a plop that’s half the size of a dime is plenty. The pump is easy to use even if your hands are wet. I wash my face in the shower, so this is valuable consumer information to have if you do the same. 

When you emulsify it between your hands, it’s a really lush feeling gel that’s almost like a shower lotion. It foams up a little, but not aggressively. If you like sudsy cleanser, it might be weird to get used to. 

It cleans your skin super nicely. Like, I can’t get over how gentle but effective it is. My face feels clean when I rinse it and my skin is super soft. It almost feels like I’ve applied moisturizer to my face. I’ve been using the matching moisturizer to this product and I don’t think my skin has looked this great like, ever. 

Save your pennies and budget for this line of products, humans. They’re absolutely worth it"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,"I really like the consistency of this cleanser, it's the perfect mix of cleansing but still hydrating and doesn't dry my skin out. It has a pleasant scent, but you have to get used to it not lathering like regular cleansers. I received this as a complimentary product to try and review."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Cream cleansing gel,"I really like the consistency of this cleanser, it's the perfect mix of cleansing but still hydrating and doesn't dry my skin out like some cleansers do. I'm still testing further to be sure I don't break out because I've very acne prone but no issues yet. I did receive this product from Influenster but my thoughts are all my own."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Squeaky Clean,Made my skin feel squeaky clean after using it (and not stripped.) My face felt so smooth afterwards too. Absolutely love it!
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,"I have dry skin and was hesitant about using the cleansing gel, but this cleansing gel is something different didn’t dry out my skin at all. A little goes a long way one pump is enough. Been using it morning and night. It’s luxury bottle."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Holy grail for me,"I have sensitive, eczema prone skin and this cleanser has been amazing for me! It's not drying at all.. I usually have a flare on my cheeks and chin and even when it's calmed down, I still have hyperpigmentation. I've been using this cleanser and the cream too, and my skin hasn't looked this good in literally years! The red patches are GONE! I haven't had 1 eczema flare since using this line! It is a gel cleanser so it doesn't lather as much as others.. which doesn't bother me at all. But if you rub it in your hands before applying, it does lather up pretty good."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,Works well! Cleans well with my PMD Beauty brush and leaves skin feeling clean and soft. No stripping.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,The Cream Cleansing Gel,"I like the product because it’s not harsh on my skin and it leave my skin feeling hydrated, but I don’t like that there’s little to no lather"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Really nice and hydrating!,"Creamy, hydrating, great for my skin and did its job very well! For the price I probably wouldn’t go for it again, but I really did enjoy this cleanser!"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Great moisturizing cleanser.,"This is a very good cleanser. It’s very moisturizing, so it will clean the skin, but will not let it dry. It is also a good product for sensitive skins. The texture is not too light, is like a hydrating milk. There is no fragrance and the packing is very fancy."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,"I’m not sure if I would recommend this product just because you get such a small quantity for such a high price, but I definitely like the way it felt on my skin and I would recommend other people try it out. I received this product for free from influenster and all opinions are my own."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Amazing,I absolutely love this cleanser it was beyond my expectations it is fragrance free gentle on my sensitive skin but tough enough to clean it I have been using it every day for a few weeks now and it was the perfect addition to my skin care routine I highly recommend this product
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Light and lathers quickly,The packaging is simple and nice. The pump is solid and dispenses product easily. This cleansing gel is really nice and light. My face definitely feels clean and it lathers well. I really like this. I feel like the price point is really good and I'd be interested in purchasing in the future.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Bright and tight!,"Love this facial cleaner, but not so much the price. It’s an amazing cleanser! I’ve used it for 3 weeks straight, and it has outperformed my expectations! My face is bright and squeaky clean! It does leave a minuscule tightening feeling, but it is not bothersome at all. I do use a makeup remover before using this wash, as it will not take off the makeup by itself. I would definitely recommend double cleansing. This face wash will definitely be worth the price for women who are concerned with dullness and older skin. I’m only 36, but my skin feels like it’s 62 most days. Since I’ve been using this cleanser, and the cream that goes with it, I can definitely tell a major difference in my skin."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Light formula,"This is a cleanser that does the job well. I like the packaging because it’s durable and deposits small amounts of product so you’re not likely to over use. I use 3 to 4 pumps. It’s a smooth formula and only lathers a tiny bit. If I’m wearing a full face of makeup I do have to double cleanse to make sure all the makeup is broken down and my face is actually clean. So this cleanser is definitely gentle. My skin doesn’t feel dry right away, so I don’t feel like I have to immediately reach for my moisturizer, my skin is comfortable.  It dries down matte as well after I rinse. My skin hasn’t had any negative response to this product but it’s not life changing. Definitely check it out if you have sensitive skin and are looking for a really light formula!"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Honest review,"The cost is ridiculously high for 100mL. It is lightweight, lightly scented, and does all the claims. Also, great for sensitive skin.  The cleansing clean feeling is hydrating and not thick. If it was not prices so high I would look into purchasing. I use this on a regular basis and have Not had any residue or drying of my skin. I did receive this product for free for review purposes and this is my honest opinion.  #AugustinusBader #Complementary #HonestReview #Free #contest"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Creamy and Hydrating!,"I didn't expect a lot from this product, since I hadn't heard of anything other than the Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader, and I was so pleasantly surprised! It is a very gentle creamy formula and a small quantity of it left the skin so hydrated! I used it as my daily cleanser for a month just before sleeping and absolutely loved it! I would place it in par with Drunk Elephant and Dermalogica which used to be my regular ones. Also this helped reduce breakouts in my case so big plus there. All and all, yes it in a little expensive but I might end up buying this again!"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,This product was life changing.  The higher price point made me hesitant at first but it totally transformed my skin
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Very Hydrating,This is a great product. It is gentle and very hydrating. I noticed a difference immediately! My skin absorbed it and I could feel it working to make my skin smooth and brighter.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Gentle cleanser,This is a gentle cleanser that you can use every day. I use it as a first step in my skin care and will usually clean my face twice. Or I will use once and then go in with a scrub. I absolutely love how fast it takes makeup off. It leaves my face feeling nourished and hydrated
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Refreshing,"This is a fabulous brand! I am impressed with the high end packaging. This cleanser does a great job, but doesn’t fully get my makeup off. I would use it paired with a makeup remover. I love that it is fragrance-free because I usually don’t like that for my skincare products. My skin feels refreshed and clean without any drying effects!"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Works good but does not lather up,"This cleanser is gentle and has no fragrance. I have oily skin and it worked well with my skin type. Only downside I feel like it is creamy but does not lather up as much as I would like. So it I felt like I needed to use it twice in order to properly cleanse. Also, it is a little more pricey then other cleansers."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Great hydrating gel cleanser,I have tried many many gel cleansers and am very picky. I want them to make my skin feel clean without being squeaky clean and stripped. I can tell when a cleanser is drying and strips natural oils and this one is one of the better ones. Id put it in my top three with Krave and Drunk Elephant!
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Gentle Effective Cleanser,"I tend to gravitate towards cleansers with acne fighting ingredients but was pleasantly surprised at this gentle, creamy cleanser. It is very hydrating and feels like luxurious when you use it. Even though it does not really foam, you still feel as though it’s getting off any dirt and lingering makeup. Also, I had no new breakouts while using it, which is definitely a win. Although I received this product for testing purposes, this review is my own."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Real results u see,"I like this product! I liked how it felt, how it made my skin look, and I like the fact that it provided visible results too"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Clean after,"I received The Augustinus Bader Rich Cream Cleansing Gel complimentary in exchange for my review. I was so excited about that vox box. I have been using that cream for about 3 weeks in a row,  and I will say I'm very impressed, light scent, 100% vegan, and gluten-free, nice texture gel evolves into hydrating milk when applied onto damp skin and then morphs into a gentle lather. Consistently remove all sorts of makeup (even waterproof mascara) leaves skin feeling ultra-clean, hydrated, nourished, and radiant. after (2 times I had felt that my skin is very dry after, but maybe it just me )I use 2 pumps and it looks enough. I like a bottle imagine and most of all that the bottle is glass."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,5 stars!,I am going to start with the packaging of this product. It is very simple and sleek but I like that. The bottle itself is a gorgeous royal blue and dark gold. The product has a very slight scent. I am not sure what it smells like but to me it isnt unpleasant. The product makes your skin feel very clean. The leather is good and foamy but you do have to get the product good and wet first. I would give it 5 stars for sure. I would definitely purchase it. This was received to be reviewed.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Great Cleanser,I received the Augustinus Bader gel cleanser compliments of Influenster and have been using it for about a month in combination with their cream. I enjoy that it doesn't have a scent and it leaves my skin so soft and clean. I would highly recommend it.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Nice cleanser but nothing extra about it,"I received the Augustinus Bader Cream Cleansing Gel to try for free to provide an unbiased opinion. The Augustinus Bader Cream Cleansing Gel has a clean, neutral smell. There is no fragrance. It is not irritating to my skin. The Cream Cleansing Gel develops into a nice light, creamy consistency when lathered up. My husband says his beard feels soft after use. With a full face of makeup I would have to double cleanse to remove all traces of makeup. For the price of the cleanser, I can get the same result using a cheaper option."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Not live up to the hype!,"The gel has creamy texture. The best part is the bottle has a pump, (and I love the copper cap and copper pump) so the product is dispensed efficiently. I usually take 1-2 pump for my skin. The gel will be absorbed in your skin as its free from fragrances, parabens and other heavy metal ingredients it won’t smell heavy, and it won’t lather too like a strong foamy frothy thing if you are used to you won’t get that sort of experience. But, when I keep applying the gel to my face, it will keep leathering a bit like small bubbles will be there and it feels like any milky cream cleanser but not too heavy one. But does it feel soft, smooth and super luxurious considering the hype the product and the brand has? Yes, it does feel luxurious. Remember not to use it to clean/wash off your makeup as it’s a cleansing gel. I first used make-up removing towelettes to remove my makeup and then use this product to clean the residue. It does make my skin looks supple and hydrated. I’m ok with this product. But it doesn’t live up to the hype for me. I love the Rich cream experience better than this one. My skin does feel little patchy, dry and stiff around the sides of the temples of the forehead and near smile lines. 
Product’s ingredient list is fantastic from rose flower water to aloe leaf juice. This gel clams, soothes, nourishes, hydrates and cleanse the skin while maintaining its natural balance. 
Pros-
Creaminess 
Packaging and color scheme is attractive
Easy to understand directions and Ingredient’s list
Patented technology 
Hydrating formula 
Amazing list of ingredients 
They donate 5% of your order value to the select charities. 
The product is 100% vegan and free from gluten, parabens, heavy metals and fragrances. 
Price range of $65 for 100ml is a very good price for a product that is formulated with breakthrough technology.

But I might not switch to the Augustine Bader Gel for sure that I have also used with the Rich cream. As there are far better cleanser gels products"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Noticed improvement,Very hydrating and great for daily use. My skin felt so smooth and soft as well as noticeably brighter after regular use
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,The A.B Gel is a great cleanser. I found it left my skin feeling soft and clean. I didn’t find it stripped my skin so that’s always a plus with any cleanser. It’s a great product but nothing I would scream aloud for. For the price I think .. there’s better out there . I mean it’s good and if you have the money try it! But if not .. there’s others for a better price.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,"Great cleanser, gets my skin clean without drying it out. Amazing for my sensitive skin!"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,I just love these products,I was so excited to try this product line out since I had seen ads pop up on my YouTube channels. The packaging is beautiful and very luxurious.  I personally enjoy gel based moisturisers however the consistency of this cream was not too thick and looked beautiful under makeup. I absolutely love this cream so much I just wish it was a bit more affordable
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,I typically am always looking for the next best cleanser but after having used this for a month as much as I wanted to love it it made me break out. I was very disappointed and the packaging is beautiful and luxurious but my skin is sensitive
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,"I received these products for free from Influenster and Augustinus bader in exchange for my honest review.  I was so excited to receive this cleanser as I have heard amazing things about this brand.  I read through the ingredients and had such high hopes for this cleanser, but unfortunately it is not a favorite for me.  The cleanser felt very creamy as I massaged it into my skin, but that's really the only positive.  I feel like it barely removed any of my makeup and it left my skin feeling very very tight after rinsing and patting dry (I have dry skin).  I tried using a couple of times with different amounts, with/without a wash cloth and it just wasn't my favorite."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Great Face Cleanser,This cleanser was so great! It lathers so well and doesn’t leave a oily residue. I have combo skin so it worked well with my type of skin. I would recommend pairing this off with the moisturizer! The amount of product you get is great. Well worth the purchase.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,God of Cleansers,"I really put this cleanser to the test to see if it was any different from any of my other cleansers. I have Dry / Combo sensitive skin with early signs of fine lines, hyper pigmentation, and dark spots. You can see before and after photos below, images were taken 4 weeks apart. 


Quality / Ingredients
The quality of the cream cleansing gel is great all the ingredients are top notch and clean. You also have the secret key  (ingredient) technology from Dr Bader which is the TFC8 which took years of research to develop. 

Packaging
Feels very high end and is gorgeous, I work in product development so I know how much time the little details on the tops, quality of the glass etc can take and I truly appreciate it. Also the boxes that the bottles come in are made fully recyclable FSC-Certified paper. 

Application
Cleansing gel applied so easily to the skin and did not strip the skin from it’s natural barrier and oils which was great! 
I only used this cleanser during the 4 weeks to fully test it out twice a day morning and night. 

Does not have fragrance did not irritate my skin and was super gentle for my sensitive skin. 

Overall
I think the cleanser is actually fairly priced compared to the rest of the line. I think it’s a high quality cleanser and really does help cleanse your skin fully and receive all the ingredient benefits."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Bomb!!!!,"I finally found my stable product. Love this cream cleansing gel. It feels amazing on the skin. The cream cleansing gel is a revitalizing daily cleanser that is formulated with soothing botanicals to gently cleanse, purify, and renew your complexion."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Great cleanser,"I love how gentle this cleanser is. It doesn’t have an overpowering chemical smell, it lathers up nicely, and it leaves my skin feeling very clean yet noticeably SOFT. I definitely recommend using it with The Cream moisturizer by the same Augustinus Bader line. Those two products together are dynamic duo of what I look for in skincare. Anti-aging hydration!"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Nice everyday cleanser!,"It’s nice everyday cleanser, no fragrance, light texture. I use it as a second step for double cleanse, lives my skin soft but a little dry. I think it’s too expensive for this product, I like and trust the brand but will not repurchase it again."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Love it!,I love this cream! It leaves my skin feeling super soft and clean. It also helped clear up the acne I get around my period. I received this as a free sample from Influenster.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,"The cleanser is fine - it’s just a basic creamy cleanser and does a fine job cleaning the face and not stripping the skin. There’s very little product in the bottle for the price, it’s about $20 per ounce of product. The really nice cleanser I generally use is about $3 per ounce and they serve the same function. It feels a bit like washing money down the drain to me. The packaging is also super frustrating - handling a heavy glass pump bottle is a bit dicey when your hands are wet."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Love!,Absolutely love this product. It has helped my skin so much! At first the smell was meh but I did get used to it.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,"Love it!  I have really dry skin with occasional breakouts, fine lines, and hyperpigmentation.  I have a 6+ step skincare routine that I’ve used for several years.  I did the recommended 28 day challenge using only two products...the cleanser and The Rich Cream.  I thought my face would be a hot mess but instead it looks amazing.  After a solid month of use, my skin looks and feels hydrated, firmer, lines are diminished, and my face has not broken out at all.  My face felt smoother and cleansed without feeling stripped.  The packaging is nice.  I love the colbalt blue bottles.  They look amazing on my vanity."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Gentle cleanser,"The cleanser is a creamy liquid. It doesn't really lather, it gets more foamy. My skin feels really clean and refreshed after cleansing with this product. I use it as a 2nd cleanser, as I need something stronger for makeup removal. It's very gentle on my skin and I love that it's lightweight and not greasy."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,You need more than 2 pumps,"This product is ok. The packaging is nice, I believe it’s glass. Like others mention , it doesn’t bubble up, but it still feels clean afterwards.  The scent is kinda soapy, idk how to explain it but it’s a fresh scent, I’m not a fan of it.  Over all it does the job the consistency is not too creamy a bit runny. I use like 5 pumps because I use an electric face brush and they work great together."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,"I love this as a gentle everyday cleanser. It has no harsh smells and my skin looks fresh after using it. It cleanses well and has a nice texture. For a product that’s not on my skin very long, the price seems high, but that’s my only complaint. Very happy with the results of the product."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Luxurious and fragrance free,"The packaging is luxurious, and I really appreciate that the product is fragrance free. I wouldn’t use it directly to remove makeup, but more as a cleanser after having removed the majority of my makeup."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Luxurious cleanser,"I really enjoyed using this cleansing gel. I was always only into cleaning balms or oils and now this changed the game for me. It has such a luxurious texture and high-end feel. It's creamy and silky, with a little lather that leaves my face feeling clean but not stripped. The packaging is a beautiful navy glass bottle with copper colored lid and accents. It's a nice size and I only needed one pump to thoroughly cleanse my face. I love the glass pump and how it's way more sanitary than a jar. It's dispenses the product perfectly and isn't wasteful. The ingredients list is simple with no silicones or anything bad. It's fragrance free which is something I appreciate in high-end skincare. It has sweet almond oil, rose water, and cumber extract. This also contains peptides and aloe. It's overall a great cleanser and totally worth the price in my opinion. This will also last a long time and I'm excited to have it. They put a lot of thought into this brand and it shows."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Love it,I love this cleanser.  Takes my makeup off and my skin feels so clean. Makes my face so soft. I love it
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,"Clean, but make it luxury","This cleanser is gorgeous, and makes my skin feel amazingly soft. I love the subtle fresh scent, and it works great to gently rose my makeup and dirt off after a long day. It pairs so well with the Rich Cream, and using both in tandem have completely changed my complexion. I will absolutely repurchase!"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,LOVE this,I love this cleanser! So gentle and good. Removes my makeup well and doesn't damage or dry my skin out. Also didn't cause any skin irritation either which is rare bc I have sensitive skin. I definitely plan to continue using and recommend this cleanser. Worth it.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,"I received The Augustinus Bader Rich Cream Cleansing Gel complimentary in exchange for my review.
This cleanser has a light scent, nice texture and leaves skin feeling ultra clean. You have to use two pumps, it's not very foamy. I have sensitive skin and I haven't noticed any irritations and my skin didn't dry out. I definitely recommend this product."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,"This is a solid second cleanser. It doesn’t consistently remove makeup but it does clean the skin without stripping. The packaging is luxurious and the ingredients read as very high end. The price point is quite high which makes this not a total win for me, especially if I have to precleanse to use it."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Excellent cream cleanser,Loved this cream cleanser. Was great for my dark spots and redness. Really helped with evening out my complexion and leaving my face feeling clean and refreshed.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Such a great cleanser!,I really like this cleanser. It does a nice job of removing dirt & makeup without drying out my skin. It’s not heavily fragranced which I really appreciate. I would definitely recommend it for anyone with dry or sensitive skin. (I received this complimentary in exchange for my honest review)
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Ehh,The pump comes out very sparingly. you need at least 2 to 3 pumps to wash your full face. I suggest lathering it onto dry skin first. I also would recommend removing make up before washing your face with this face wash. I am not in love with this product and I would not purchase it.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,love!,This cleanser is awesome! It definitely cleanses my skin and removes any leftover make up but is very gentle and was not irritating at all. I received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,So far so good,The cleanser doesn’t really lather but that doesn’t matter to me because it still does it’s job. I LOVE that it’s odorless and my skin has had ZERO irritation or breakouts from it and I have fairly sensitive skin. It’s gentle on my skin and it’s a great size bottle but I do need to use 2 pumps and that’s when not wearing any makeup (I haven’t worn makeup yet since using this) so I’m not sure if it’ll require more when I do wear makeup.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Nice Cleanser!,"The cream cleansing gel is a great cleanser! It leaves my face feeling clean, but not taut. It seemed to control my oil well also. I prefer a cleanser that doubles as a makeup remover, so I probably would repurchase, but it is a great cleanser if you don’t mind two steps."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Perfect cleanser for sensitive skin,I received this face cleanser from Influenster in exchange for my honest review and I have to say that I like it because it’s light weight but you know that it’s cleaning your skin while hydrating it. I appreciate the fact that it doesn’t have a scent and it is not rough on your skin so it’s the perfect face cleanser for anyone that has sensitive skin. In terms of the price it’s a little expensive but not so high so I think it’s worth it.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Luxury Skin Care,"I integrated the Augustinus Bader Cream Cleansing Gel into my morning and evening skin care routine for the past four weeks. The gel slightly foams and is one of the gentlest facial cleansers I’ve ever used. My skin felt neutral in moisturization; not overstripped but also not increased in moisture. I didn’t see a dramatic improvement in my skin after four weeks that I was expecting with a high end luxury product, but I did notice a brighter skin tone and less dullness.  My fine lines look the same as before. My skin is fair, combination, non-sensitive, age 34. The packaging is very nice, but I will say I do not feel this product is a good cost value to me as my results are subtle."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,"Gentle, Thorough Cleanser","I love this cleanser! It doesn’t dry my skin, but it does leave it squeaky clean. It’s a bit pricey, so I don’t think I’d buy more when I run out, but I do like it."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Best face wash,"The Augustinus Bader Rich Cream Cleansing Gel  is one of the best face washes that I’ve used. It lathers up nicely and feels so amazing while I’m washing my face. It’s been great with keeping my face moisturized, clean, and soft. It only takes a small amount to get my face clean and free of makeup. A little of this goes a long way. The scent is natural and clean. After using this for only a few weeks, I notice my face has brightened and I have less fine lines. I’ll be purchasing again in the future when this bottle starts to run low."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,"Nice cleanser overall. I did not notice a smell, it made my face clean, and I liked the results. It did not remove my Lancôme mascara, but I didn’t mind to use a separate eye makeup remover beforehand. The packaging is lovely; it’s super luxurious and looks nice sitting on your sink. This cleanser was not my favorite, but I certainly enjoyed testing it out and using it and will continue to do so. Great product!"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Cleeean,"When I test skin care products, I like to start applying it alone without my usual skincare products just so I can get a realistic idea of what the product is capable of doing to my combination dry skin. 

I typically double cleansed just because it makes me feel cleaner. However, I don’t double cleanse with the gel cleansing. I feel like this product does get all the makeup and dirt out but it sort of leaves my skin a bit dry if I don’t hurry and apply my toner or moisturizer. I cleanse with Augustinus Bader gel cleanser first and then cleanse again with my CeraVé Hydrating Facial Cleanser just so it can feel more balanced and hydrated. 

After using doing this for a whole month along with the Augustinus Bader Gel Cleanser, my skin has appeared brighter, even, toned and regenerated and it’s texture has looked smoother and firm."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Nice cleanser,I love the ingredients and that it’s unscented. I tend to have dry skin but can get breakouts so I was excited to try this.  First thoughts are I like the packaging. It’s a pretty color scheme and it’s a heavy duty glass.  It’s very gentle on my skin and doesn’t dry it out. Doesn’t lather a ton but feels luxurious on the skin.   I was hoping to be a bit more impressed considering the cost but I do like this cleanser.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,This stuff is the truth. It breaks down oil and dirt like it’s nothing! I usually use a balm or oil to remove makeup and on some days I just reach for this and it gets the job done without drying out my skin. I was excited to try this when it was sent to me and will be purchasing when it runs out. This paired with the the moisturizer is a match made in heaven.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Great Cleanser!,"I got this complimentary and have been using daily the last week. It’s a cleansing gel, so it won’t foam up too much, but create more of a milky/lather solution. I have oily skin, so this is the perfect formula for me. My skin doesn’t really feel too dry afterwards and I like that it’s gentle with good ingredients."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Amazing,"I really love this cleanser. At first the consistency felt a little odd, however i really like how light it is, and it doesn’t dry out your skin. One of the best cleanser I’ve used so far. Highly recommend!"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,Gel formulas aren’t really for me. It feels like a serum and I’d prefer a lathering cleanser. It has good ingredients but just isn’t my type of cleanser.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Worth it,"Love this cleanser - but only after pre-cleansing. I am not a fan of the lack of scent, it sells a little like plastic... but - it does everything it advertises! Especially when used with the moisturizer! I now could care less about the scent - it works amazingly!"
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,"This cleanser is nice, the gorgeous blue glass bottle with gold top is very elegant packaging. I really like how gentle it is especially since I have sensitive skin. It gave me no issues with my skin at all which was a plus. I used 2-3 pumps each time I washed my face. After using this product my skin feels hydrated even prior to putting on the moisturizer. The price is pretty high so it’s definitely a splurge but I think for those willing to pay the price it’s worth it."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Amazing!,This is a brand new product line for me and I’m quite impressed! I have extremely dry skin that gets worse during the New England winters so I have to be super careful about not washing it with harsh cleansers that strip whatever little moisture I have left on my skin. The creamy texture of this cleanser is great (even though it doesn’t lather up much) because it leave my skin super clean without leaving it feeling tight and stretched. You know what I’m talking about!
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,This product is amazing! I used this product and was very pleased with the results. My skin feels smoother after each wash. I have noticed that my dark spots have faded and my pores have diminished. Excellent product! Highly recommended!! I received this complimentary product for reviewing purposes.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Great cleanser,First off I love the packaging and how sleek it looks. You do need at least 3 pumps in order to clean your entire face. It doesn’t get quite foamy or bubbly like other cleaners which is nice. Circular motions and you can feel the dirt and make up coming off. Leaves my face feeling fresh!
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,This cleanser is so hydrating and leaves my skin feeling like I just came out of a facial. It completely removes makeup without stripping the skin at all - my skin actually feels more hydrated and healthier after using this product!
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Fresh face,Gentle cleanser that removes makeup nicely. It had a nice lather even with my hard well water. It removed my makeup and didn't leave a residue. I liked the feel and how clean my skin felt after use.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Works great,"I really like this cleanser! It  cleanses my face and doesn’t have an overpowering scent at all, just a subtle natural smell. I feel the price is a little to high for this cleanser compared to others, but I love that it comes in a gorgeous blue glass bottle with gold cap that looks so elegant."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Augustinus Bader The Cream Cleansing Gel,"Much like The Cream, this product is unscented. Decent cleanser overall, but did not remove trace amounts of makeup left after initial removal. Doesn't dry me out as much as some cleansers, but also did not see any real difference in my skin versus my normal daily cleaning products."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Moisturizing Cleanser,"The Cream Cleansing Gel was also easy to add into my skincare routine. My sensitive skin was not agitated at all. I liked how moisturized my skin felt after using. I definitely would recommend using a precleanse or makeup remover before this cleaner as it’s not great at removing everything off my face like my usual cleanser. I use 2 pumps and massage on my face, there is no lather. I followed with The Cream moisturizer at night and loved the two together. I had no skin sensitivity nor breakouts due to this product. It is pricy, but nice for a splurge now and again as it’s effective."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Amazing Clean!,"I can’t say enough great things about this cleanser. First of all, the packaging is perfect. It’s both functional and pretty. The consistency is perfect. I love the way it makes my skin feel. This cleanser is very gentle on my skin while cleansing extremely well. There is no greasy or sticky residue left behind at all. Only clean, hydrated skin. Immediately after the first use, my skin felt hydrated and soft. After continued use, my skin appears much healthier. All of my dry patches are gone. My skin tone looks more even. Even the fine lines seem to be disappearing. I’m in love with this cleanser and will definitely continue to use it. I would highly recommend it to everyone."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,Pretty good,This is a good cleanser but the price is a little high. You can get a cleanser that works just as good for half the price. The scent isn’t too strong which is something I do look for. It lathers up ok and does a pretty good job of cleansing your face.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Cream Cleansing Gel,USA,"Amazing, but don’t love the price tag","Okay this cleanser is pretty great. I love how gentle it is while also being effective at removing makeup. My skin always feels soft and hydrated after using it - never stripped! It’s also a great makeup remover, including pesky mascaras. The only downside for me is the price point which is why I gave it 4 stars. The Herbivore Pink Cloud cleanser is equally as amazing and less than half the price!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,Philippines,rather strong ,This is a rather strong acne cleanser so maybe it’s best to alternate this with a milder cleanser so the skin stays hydrated. A little goes a long way so no need to apply too much. 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Great Product,"I bought this product for my teenage son who started having breakouts, and he used it without fail every day. It has helped clear up his skin and he really likes it and makes sure he doesn’t run out."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,helps facial acne,"This is one of the only face washes with active ingredients that I am using for more than 2 years. It definitely helps to fight acne. I used this both for face and body. I would say it helps body acne much more than it does help face acne. But I have noticed that I get more acne on my face if I skip this face wash for a week. So it doesn’t get rid of the acne completely, but I would probably have only one to two acne on my face if I am using this face wash every day. I only wash my face once a day with it to prevent dry skin."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,Singapore,This works!,I been using this for 1 week as I have acne cyst and my colleagues see great difference in my skin just after 3 days. First of all it really shrink all the acne and reduces the clog pores . It does dry the skin but I pair it with a awesome moisturiser that’s acne cyst friendly. I don’t have breakouts anymore. It’s managed my current acne cyst and. Acne cyst scares really while. Can’t wait to see the improvements in my skin after 3 month. I actually repurchase a second bottle since I notice  this runs out of stock easily online and in stores. 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,Philippines,peter thomas clearing wash,"thank you very much sephora... the delivery is super fast... i love this product because it really works on my skin, i just use small amount and it totally cleanse my skin"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,"I love the peachy smell, and it's a very effective cleanser! Like all PTR cleansers, I wish the bottle wasn't a twist-off - I somehow always pour out too much cleanser. Still, a small packaging downside for a great product"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Back Acne Clearing Wash,My 14 year old daughter had really bad back acne (cysts). She incorporated this in her shower routine and this was the holy grail. She only uses this to wash her back. It took about 3-4 months to start seeing a difference but this cured those embarrassing bumps. We tried everything. This was better than what the dermatologist prescribed.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,I purchased this in March 2021 and have about 1/2 of the bottle left.  My dermatologist told me to use something with Salicylic Acid to help my breakouts.  I got this along with several products from the Peter Thomas Roth Acne line and my skin has improved.  A small amount of this goes a long way and lathers very well.  This cleanser smells like grapefruit or something that I don't really enjoy but I will repurchase anyways because I think this is really helping to improve my skin.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,I recommend,I’m still breaking out with cystic acne but I live this face wash does not leave a residue. I use tea trea oil in combination with it when I break out. It has helped clear up my face a lot tho.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Acne cleaner,This is my first time using this acne cleaner for back. So far I don't have a problem with the product.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,A skincare staple,If PTR ever discontinued this I would cry forever. I’ve been using it for four years now and I swear by it. I had really oily and acne prone skin until I started using this. I use so many other PTR products because I loved this one so much.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,Malaysia,PTR Acne Clearing Wash,Good product but doesn't help with acnes that much. I have acnes beneath my skin and it will not work on those. I have tried MARIO BADESCU Acne Facial Cleanser as well but same and non will work. It smells a bit orangy and comparing to BADESCU Acne Facial Cleanser make your skin dryer.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,Philippines,Love it,This facial wash is really amazing it definitely worked in controlling breakout specially those attributed to prolonged wearing of mask. I live the smell  it also does not dry my skin. Will definitely repurchase this product 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,Malaysia,Peter Thomas Roth ‘Acne Clearing Wash’,"During this trying times when donning the mask is mandatory, it’s highly likely impossible to not have mask acne. For anyone with insanely oily skin not just on the T-zone, but on the U-zone as well like me, this is definitely a godsent! Oh, and it smells divine and nothing medicinal despite 2% salicylic acid as its core ingredient."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,"this product did wonders for my skin! i’ve been struggling with acne and this clear my skin up so much! i got the acne clearing kit and i highly recommend this and the moisturizer. works great for teenagers struggling with acne, it’s a must try!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,very helpful if you remember to moisturize after,It makes a real difference for me in fighting existing breakouts and preventing new ones. Make sure to moisturize though! It is somewhat drying.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,Malaysia,too strong,This cleanser too strong for daily use. My face feel too dry and tight after twice daily use causing new break out and pimple due to dry skin. May not repeat the order . Need a milder cleanser for my face
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,My Go To Product,"I’ve been struggling with adult acne for years now. I’ve tried just about everything out there, until a friend recommended Peter Thomas Roth and I will never use any other product ever again!!! I got the Acne-Clear Essentials kit and after those 30 days I decided to buy the products individually in the big bottles. It’s pricey but definitely worth it. I’ve seen improvement in my skin, even now during the pandemic where I’m wearing a mask everyday and get irritated."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,NOPE.,"The fragrance in this cleanser is strong, it bothers me. My skin became red after using it. Normally I would use a different cleanser with the same amount of salicylic acid (2%) and that certain cleanser never gave me problems. In fact, it was cheaper than this product and it gave positive results for me. I plan on returning this."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,IN TWO DAYS.,"TLDR- I'd completely wrecked my skin in a few days with a bad product and had a full middle school breakout on my face, neck, and decolletage. Tried a few things with minimal results and bought this out of desperation- in TWO DAYS I have seen weeks worth of results. The spots are flat and dry, the texture spots are 80% gone (what's still there is 50% feeling better), and my skin has a healthy glow.  Life saver!!!!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Cleans well but has fragrance,"Cleans well but the fragrance makes my skin sensitive. 
Love the smell though, it smells like a fresh grapefruit"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Must have for acne prone skin,Ok wow! I love this cleanser so much it replaced my previous daily cleanser. I have cystic acne which I have been able to keep under control with a clean diet and strict skin regimen. However after using this I noticed that I had less breakouts surrounding my period and sometimes even no breakouts at all. I LOVE this product! Must have if you have acne and sensitive skin.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Holy Grail,"This product truly is my holy grail face wash. It’s gentle and doesn’t burn when applying to my face. I’ve been using it for over a year now and FINALLY I’ve found a face wash that my face hasn’t gotten used to. I suffered with pretty bad acne (especially cystic acne) and now I rarely get breakouts. I use this face wash 5 days a week and an exfoliating face wash (proactive) the other two and it works perfect for me. A little goes a long way so the bottle lasts forever as it’s a good size, and the price is completely reasonable for that reason alone. If you’re on the fence, try it. I don’t think you’ll be disappointed!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,Malaysia,Hands down to the best face wash ever for acne prone skin!,"Unfortunately it's already out of stock as for now. can't wait for sephora to restock the item again. its hard to find a good face wash. suitable for oily, combination and acne prone skin. less foamy and effective! "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,BEST PRODUCT FOR ACNE,"Have always struggled with acne. I have tried every product there is and this is one of the only products that I see a drastic change. My skin has never been this clear EVER!! No matter what the circumstances are my skin looks AMAZING! The best part about all of this is that even though it has salicylic acid in it, which can be drying and stripping, my face still feels hydrated. 12/10 recommend this!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Smells Great,LOVE THIS PRODUCT. it seriously helped my acne plus it smells amazing.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,No Noticeable Change,"I have acne-prone combination skin that tends to fall more on the dryer side. This didn't necessarily help my acne but it didn't make it worse. I never noticed any change in the OVERALL appearance of my skin - I actually noticed that my pores on my nose were 10x bigger after I used this. I have NEVER noticed this with any other facial product and I've been using a lot of name brand facial products for years. I still would recommend this to someone who suffers from more severe acne as I do think this could help. It never made my acne worse. 
Make sure you get a good lather with it when applying. A little goes a long way with this product! This has also lasted me over a year so you do get your money's worth with the amount of product you pay for. 
For reference: I'm 22 years old, have light acne and have very sensitive skin."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Would not recommend,This product did not work on my skin. (Dry acne prone sensitive) I wanted to like the product but it’s just another product going in the garbage. My skin didn’t improve at all while using this product.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,It Was Okay,Used this product every single day and it was okay. It didn’t really make a difference in my skin. Would I buy this again? Nope. Would I invest my money in a better product? Most def.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,Malaysia,too pricey,"This product dries out my skin after a few days of using it however it serves its purpose by reducing the amount of acne. You just need to get the right moisturizer, essence & serum to use after using this cleanser."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,I came into this store looking for something to clear my skin cause i have really bad acne and oily skin and i asked they suggests this so i tried it and its amazing it clears my skin it fades my dark spots and works really quick so now i stick with that brand
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Didn't work for me,"Unfortunately this face wash did nothing for me. I have mild but consistent acne with combo skin. This dried me out in all the wrong places and I saw zero difference with my breakouts. I wanted to give it a fair shot so I used the whole bottle, but unfortunately it never showed improvement."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,best face wash for oily skin,"All throughout high school I had pretty bad skin and a lot of redness, when I started using this face wash my skin has been completely clear and the oils on my face are much more controlled. I definitely recommend this for anyone who is struggling with breakouts and oily skin. I’d say it’s worth the money."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,Malaysia,Mr,"it heals the pimples, antiseptic funtion effectively but does not dry up the skin, won't feel tigthness after several wash off, gentle yet antimicrobial feeling"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Great Product! Will buy again!,"I’ve incorporated this acne clearing wash into my face routine for about 2-3 months now... it has been the best decision ever. It has cleared up my acne on my cheeks. High price, but worth it considering its volume."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,bring back the buffing beads,"I used to be a fan of the PTR budding beads acne wash but they discontinued that unfortunately. So, I went for this without high hopes. It does the job for cystic acne around my chin. I use it 2 x a week with a combination of a light exfoliant, so it doesn’t Cecile over drying. I have stubborn acne scars, within a week, it’s clearing up. Don’t forget to moisturize!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,"If you have acne that’s persistent and can be cystic,  get the orange one instead. You’re welcome."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Cleared up acne and completely clears makeup.,"As someone who is into makeup, has to have it on a lot for acting, and is a teen boy with oily skin, I started to break out worse than normal. I started washing my face with this and completely loved it. It clears all of my makeup off just with my hands. I’m sure if I had a Clarisonic this would be even better for me. It has salicylic acid in it but it doesn’t dry out my skin. It makes my skin feel less oily but not dry. I use this with a full routine, and only get occasional breakouts now. I’m am going to be purchasing this for a while as my cleanser."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Best acne wash around !,"I’ve tried Proactive, I’ve tried many over the counter face washes for acne. None of them work like this wash! It’s the best!!! Makes my skin feel good and clean and my acne is clear. Thank God!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,I wish I would’ve tried this before!,Absolutely love it! Best product ever to get clear skin if you’re naturally oily.  Totally worth the money!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,,loving it..,"this facial wash helped me with my acne, it’s true to its claims that it is not drying.. it’s a bit pricey but little goes a long way.. hope it will go on sale. The product itself is really good.. "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Love! Great for teen/stubborn acne,"I waited a few weeks before writing a review to see if it really worked.  Well it does!  I haven't had any cystic or infected acne since the first week of using this wash.  I did break out the first week, probably from the acid clearing out what was already there, but after that my face has been clearer than it has in months.  I've been on antibiotics and topicals for acne for several years now, and now I've stopped using all topical treatments and lowered my antibiotics.  I use the wash once a day with only moisturizer after.  My face is pretty used to strong chemicals by now so I wasn't sensitive to the wash, but if you aren't used to acids then I would test this out first.  I highly recommend this wash for anyone dealing with that stubborn infected acne.  It totally works!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,This isn’t for me I guess. I LOVE PTR products absolutely some of the best in the market but for me this face wash hasn’t done anything I expected. I have adult hormonal acne and I thought this product would help prevent or calm down some of it but it hasn’t. The quantity for the price is amazing and the cleanliness of this product is amazing. When I use my clarifying lotion afterwards there’s no missed grime left on my fasts which I love but I unfortunately it hasn’t helped control my acne. I won’t return I’ll continue to use it until it’s gone then I’ll try another one of their similar products
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Under Control,This has been a lifesaver for my oily skin. I've tried many other products and this brand is a five star across the board. Within a month I've noticed many benefits for using this not s. Shine in my t-zone is under control where my foundation doesn't feel like it's sliding off. My skin feels so clean and doesn't have the feeling of residue. My pores and skin redness is tamed. What is most important is my acne is under control. Within a week of using the entire skin line my breakouts during my menstrual cycle are finally under control.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,,not good ,not at all effective.  too harsh for skin not doing  anything  what it saying made a mistake to buy this one😕😕😕........................ ..................
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,needs new packaging,"Love this product but the bottle is terrible. It has opened up and spilled inside my travel kit countless times ruining everything inside including my bathroom bag. Wish they would make an alternative bottle because the product is great, but I won’t use it due to the impractically engineered bottle."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,"I have very dry skin, and for the past year or so I have suffered from sudden acne along my upper jawline (late twenties). Drugstore stuff didn’t work, Murad didn’t work. I’ve been using this cleanser followed by the aha/bha gel every morning and evening and they’ve definitely made a positive impact already. Seem to be clearing up existing acne by at least a third or half, and equally importantly, not making my dry skin worse! Would recommend the kit to test out to anyone with similar issues."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,"good product, but be prepared :)","when i first started using this product, it was great. my skin already showed signs of clearing after about two days of usage, and it was easy to manage into my daily schedule. however, after about a week’s usage with the product, dry flakes appeared beside my nose and eyes, and though they were hardly noticeable, it irritated my skin in those spots. while i do recommend the product for clearing skin with bad acne issues, i would say a hydrating moisturizer is very much needed with it, or the same problems for future buyers might occur."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,THANK YOU PETER THOMAS ROTH THIS SAVED MY SKIN,I have never had acne issue until about a year ago... cystic acne on my chin/forehead tried everything you could think of... so then I started looking for products that were acne prone products and came across this and the therapeutic sulfur mask and this saved my face! I’m a hair stylist so I usually have makeup on 5 days a week which plays a part on my skin... this definitely dries you out though. I recommend finding a heavy cream to put on your face at night. I used the tatcha dewy skin and it works great! Pricey face moisturizer but it actually works along so with this face wash and the mask! Definitely try out if you are having some cystic acne problems!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,,holy grail,This product issa holy grail for oily skin or acne prone skin. It helps me. But quiet sting. But overall it really helps me. I really love this cleanser but quiet pricey but it last long cuz the bottle was so big! 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,I never should have left you,I’ve been using this face was for about a year. It has made my skin infinitely better and i get so many compliments about my skin. I recently didn’t repurchase it because I try my hardest to not use products that are not cruelty free. Less than 2 weeks with my new cleanser and i am breaking out LIKE CRAZY. This may have to be an exception I must make it’s that good.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,i can't believe it WORKED!,"I have combination, moderately sensitive skin. I also deal with a lot of redness and pimples/acne. The acne has been an issue for over 10 years for me and I have tried what feels like everything, from eating healthier to going to a dermatologist. I've been going down the list basically of all the acne cleansers at Sephora, since nothing I have tried so far has really worked for me. After using this cleansers morning and night for about 4 days I could already notice results. I have been using it now for almost 2 months and will keep repurchasing because it has almost cleared up all active blemishes and stopped new ones from forming. I literally can't believe it. I'm not saying this product will work for you, because I know I heard that countless times on products that never worked for me, but give this one 7 days and if you don't see any results you can always return it. It is worth the TRY! I also followed it with their whole acne line and I use Caudalie VinoPerfect Whipped Moisturizer in the pink tube, and Ole Henrikson Vitamin C serum."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,It Actually Works!,Great acne cleanser. Gentle on skin (I have sensitive skin and it didn’t burn at all) yet effective. I’ve struggled with acne all my life & when I started using this product daily (2x a day) I noticed a significant improvement in not only active breakouts but also with hyperpigmentation on my face in general. 10:10 highly recommend. :)
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,really does work!!!,"WOW! So recently, since summer started, I’ve gotten really bad acne. My face was just covered in big pimples and redness, then I came across this acne started kit at sephora which included this tiny version clearing wash. Within a week I already saw inprovement! This stuff really helped clear up my skin. My acne hasn’t gone away completely but I can see it already going away. I will say though I didn’t use it for one day and I broke out bad. So I believe you have to use this every day to see results!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,,not bad,"This doesn't feel drying at all. After washing, my face felt soft and non-greasy. However, it does leave some makeup residue on your face. Best used as a second cleanser. The lemon scent can be a bit cloying, but if you focus on the benefits of the active ingredients, you can see past it."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,,good purchase,"it really cleanse out my acne, its worth the price, you can see improvement within a week
but have to use it wisely, i used it before aha and had  little breakours on cheeks
highly recommend to whom has acne problem and wants to simplify the skincare routine "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,,Non-drying,"Vey late delivery aside, this cleanser lathers up nicely and is non drying. Ive used it for just a couple of days now so i am still waiting for its effect on my oily and acne prone skin"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Cures break outs!!,I have Combo VERY sensitive acne prone skin. This stuff doesnt give me a crazy flare up like most products do and seriously gets rid of my blemishes. The only reason why i rate a 4 and not a 5 is because it can be a bit drying. Great for anyone with oily skin but if you are normal or combo just make sure you have a good moisturizer! But its great it will get rid of big blemishes in about 2 days and i will see a serious decrease in redness and size within a few hours of using this.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Was okay for me,"I bought this product twice because it seemed to get the job done. Using this on my skin did not stop my breakouts, but it did help control them in some way. A downfall was that this product was a bit drying on my skin."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,,cleared skin,i used twice a day everyday and my acne just cleared up after a week. it has a consistency of light and watery gel and has a strong fresh medicated smell. love it! 
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Thankful for this cleanser!,"I started using this over a year ago and don’t want to use anything else now. It clears and controls my acne breakouts. I have gone through so many acne cleansers in my life, and this is THE ONE I will continue using. I highly recommend trying it."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,My new go-to!!,"This is my new go-to! I switched from Clinique Acne to this without a problem. It made my skin feel so much smoother within a week. Hormonal acne has really subsided. I love this! It smells weird at first (sickeningly fruity), but you get used to it."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,,perfect for acne skin,"this cleanser was so affordable, as we all know peter thomas roth is high end product. u received 250ml product and could last you more than 4months.  i used it on evening only because it maje you skin feel dry.  but helps to treat your acne. "
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,"Purchased this product specifically for acne. My acne has stayed the same, now I don’t know if it’s  just me or the product, but it did not help me out with my acne, and I was desperately hoping it would given the price of this product. Maybe it’ll work for others, but personally, didn’t work out for me."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,it works,I think this is a good product. It took about a week for it to really work it’s magic but my skin has cleared substantially and looks more even and vibrant I’m giving it 4 stars because of the time it takes to see results.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,,new fav,if you have oily combi acne prone skin this will change your skincare regime. my fav used to be the black bottle boscia cleanser which is no.longer available. but this PTR one has sooo much more product for the price and it works.my pores are less congested and hardly have any new breakouts.love!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,,acne clearing wash,"I like that its not harsh and that its mild enough for daily use when skin has cleared. Removing one star due to its price; worth it when discounted. Without discount, I'd go for the Mario Basdescu acne wash."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,"Nice face wash, it definitely helps reduce acne and prevent it but slow to aid in actually getting rid of stubborn problem acne. I’ve been using this product for two weeks and my hormonal acne has improved but is not cleared."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,It works,It works. Believe me. It has cleared my acne.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,This saved my face!,"There was a while I had acne that was bothering me so I decided I’d get a Neutrogena face wash that I have used before and worked... as I used it it RUINED my face! I broke out so bad! And looked like it gave me a rash all over my face, a rash with giant pimples.. anyways I needed a new face wash obviously I I picked this face was up! And let me tell you it savedddd my face! It took away almost all my acne! Now I have like acne scars and unfortunately this face wash doesn’t help with that, but this face wash will get rid of your acne! I will say though, pay attention to your face and when your acne is all gone start to use a lighter face wash that’s not as intense, or this will over time dry your face out. But if you have bad acne and don’t know what to try anymore this is your holy grail! Promise."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Didn’t help :(,"Lots of product for the money, but this did not help clear or improve my skin at all."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,it works!!!,This is the only face wash that works. I’m sooo shocked with the results!! I will def try the other products now as well.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,"Did a great job in taking off whatever makeup my wipe didn’t take off, but that’s about it. It didn’t help clear my skin at all"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,This stuff dried out my skin. It's really strong so you probably only need to use it every other day.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Great Acne Wash!,Good scent and works well! I use 2-3 times a week!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Love this,Use this product all the time have went through 4 bottles keeps me looking fresh and my skin firm
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,best acne wash/acne system I've ever used!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Works well.,"I have adult acne, primarily hormonal so I've just gotten used to the idea that I will always have acne. I don't have cystic acne though. This actually works really well. When I first started using it, it worked great, but when I repurchased it, it didn't seem as effective. I won't blame it on the product because my skin always does that. I feel that maybe I should switch to a different product for a while and then come back to this one."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Favorite PM cleanser,"This has become a must have in my nightly routine (I use SR Ceramic Slip in the AM). This stuff has completely obliterated my acne. My skin has never been this clear in my entire life. It smells like peaches, which is just an added bonus"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,I gave it my best try,"After using this for 4 months, I’ve decided to finally change after I run out of this bottle. Overall I have liked it but it definitely has not cleared up my skin. I’ve also been using it with the max correction clearing pads and the sulfur mask as a spot treatment and occasionally as a mask. There are positives though. My face always feels clean after using and not dried out and the scent is nice. It does an okay job. You do get a lot of product for the price. I would recommend purchasing the trial size kit before purchasing full sizes. After I switch to another acne system I will continue to use the max correction pads which are amazing!!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,This stuff + the acne scrub they have saved me from a summertime acne episode that I usually get this time of year
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,Have to precleanse your skin or this doesnt give a good clean because it’s more of a gel and doesn’t lather. I’m so oily this summer and it’s alright but I’m still looking for my holy grail.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,I use this daily.,"Love this face wash! It has a wonderful scent and a nice consistency. It helps keep acne at bay, but I still need to use a topical cream afterward. It doesn't dry out my face like most acne washes. PTR's products are hit or miss for me, but this is one that I will repurchase."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Amazing,"I have stuggled with acne for over 20 years. I've tried everything from peels, oral and topical treatments but nothing seemed to worked. My face looked so horrible that I could never look persons in the face .  I recently tried a new Esthetician who recommended this product to me. My first week of using the product I noticed a significant difference in my skin. Its been three months and my face is flawless. This acne wash is a life saver."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,PTR products are in a league of their own.,I absolutely love this product!!! I have battled Ance half of my life and this wash with my PTR Ance clearing gel has cleared my skin dramatically. I love the smell and the slimy texture the cleanser has it just spreads so easily over my skin without over drying.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Feels Good But...,"This face wash feels good on my face. I love the smell of it, it's more of a Citrus smell. But it's not helping out my acne. I won't be buying this again it's just not working out for me. But it might for others."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,Love the way it makes my skin feel. Haven’t had it a week yet but it looks like it’s helping....
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,my skin is very dry and this product hydrates very well. My acne is sooo bad i have been trying to get rid of it for the past 6 months and nothing has worked but then i tried this and it has helped my acne so much i had under the skin pimples and zits and whitehead’s and it got rid of it all.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Amazing cleanser!!!,I have been using this cleanser to treat my acne and I feel like it has made a huge difference! I recommended to a friend and she loved it as well. I don’t think I could ever go back to any other cleanser that I have previously owned. The scent is pretty great too!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,only cleanser that works for me,"I absolutely love this cleanser! It is the only one that truly works for me. I’ve tried Murad, Lancer, Ole Henriksen, Belif, Kate Somerville, etc. None of them work as good as this one. My skin is oily/combo and very acne prone. I’ve already gone through 2 bottles of this and I’m about to start my third one. Now I will say this product may dry you out but as long as you don’t use too many acne/mattifying products you should be fine. So PTR do not discontinue this!!!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Good Stuff,"This stuff really works, it's not super drying, but it gets the job done"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,One of the best face washes I’ve used!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,THE WORST EVER,"i used this product once and will never use it again. I have normal skin, never oily or dry. this product made the skin on my face peel off because it dried it out so much. i now have dry patches all over my face where skin is just flaking off. i am still trying to get my skin back to normal after two weeks."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,This is a great cleanser for acne,I really like this cleanser although it can be a little drying. I use it when my skin is breaking out alot. My only issue is that it is quite expensive
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Disappointed!,"I absolutely loved the Beta hydroxy acne wash that was discontinued, it helped keep my acne in control. I bought this version and it does nothing to keep the acne at bay. It doesn't even clear my breakups fast like the beta hydroxy. So disappointed this is the replacement."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Great product,"This is a fantastic product! I really can't say enough about it. After years of treating my acne with antibiotics and prescription topical creams (as well as medicated washes that dried out and irritated my skin), I tried this wash. It smells wonderful like grapefruit. It prevents acne without drying or irritating my skin. Now I rarely have a breakout. In addition, I only have to use a little at night to wash off my makeup. The large bottle lasts forever, so the price is actually very reasonable. It works so well that I even take it in a travel bottle on trips. I have very sensitive skin, and this is the only face wash that has not broken me out or dried out my skin. It's phenomenal. Thank you PTR! Love this! Highly recommend!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,It worked,It worked for me for the first 2 weeks and then after it started to intensely break out my skin. Also has a scent.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,Made me suuuuuper dry and now i have redness and bumps all over my face and im usually super oily :( almost looks like i had an allergic reaction to it
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,Great for an every day cleanser for problematic skin like mine! Smells great too!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Acne Clearing Wash,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Acne Clearing Wash,"After 24 hours of use I can already see a major difference. I’ve literally not seen anything like this before, nothing has worked this well and this quick. Normally I don’t leave reviews on skincare products so soon, but this was so quick and I’m impressed. I can’t wait to see how quick it’ll clear up my skin"

CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish Solutions Cleansing Gel,Australia,Too drying,Even though I have very oily skin I found this product to be too drying. It made my skin feel tight. Because it drys out your skin it made me more oily during the day as my skin was compensating for the lack of moisture.

CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish Solutions Cleansing Gel,Malaysia,Cleansing Gel,I loved all the products in this line. Cleansing gel is good but I honestly prefer the cleansing foam over this gel one. I feel that it doesn’t get rid of all impurities on my skin as effective as the cleansing foam. Won’t be repurchasing. Will stick to the cleansing foam for now. 
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish Solutions Cleansing Gel,Singapore,anti blemish gel,The delivey was so fast and as I opened the bittles it smells good. will surely use later before sleeping 🥰 and if it wirks ... will surely reorder these items. thanks sephora !

CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish Solutions Cleansing Gel,,Helps Control the Breakouts ,"I LOVE this cleanser. I have found it helps me since introducing this to my morning and evening routines. I have been using it for about 6 months now, and it controls my problematic skin. I also use this with the moisturiser in the same range. I find it definitely helps, and the breakouts tend to go away in a more timely fashion. "
CLINIQUE-Anti-Blemish Solutions Cleansing Gel,,review,"Cleans my face amazingly, my skin has improved since using this product. I’ve never had great skin but since introducing this product into my skincare routine, my skin has improved. I also use many other Clinique products in the anti blemish range "
WANDER BEAUTY-Drift Away™ Cleanser,Singapore,alright,probably hoping to treat existing breakouts and make pigmentation from past acne scars disappear. hope it works
WANDER BEAUTY-Drift Away™ Cleanser,Australia,Lush,"I love this cleanser, it feels like silk on my skin. I use it every morning and it doesn't feel like it strip's my skin. I will definitely be ordering again. "
ELEMIS-Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm,Singapore,Beautiful scent,"My first experience with a cleansing balm and wow. I look forward to my night routine, the scent is so relaxing and spa-like. The product removes makeup well and I do a double cleanse with my usual cleanser. "
ELEMIS-Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm,Singapore,good,"I prefer this to eve lom as it smells better and is better value, cleans very too.

Deducted half star as it is runny or watery.  so it can get messy when you use it."
ELEMIS-Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm,Singapore,Holy grail,"The best cleansing balm that I've ever tried. It's a very rich oil that melts the makeup easily (I've only tested with non-waterproof stuff). In touch with water, it turns into a milky formula. It comes with a tiny towel to remove the product as indicated. You can also double as a mask, with clean skin, leaving for some minutes. Super moisturizing! Spa-like smell. "
ELEMIS-Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm,Singapore,Best Cleansing Balm Ever,LOVE LOVE LOVE..  expensive but worth every cents..  Really makes u feel like u are in a spa..  Love the smell.. So many ways In using it as makeup remover..  Cleanser and mask.. 
ELEMIS-Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,Superb! ,5 star product! spotless after this balm cleanser... Skin feels supple even after double cleansing... Mild essential oil fragrance feels soothing... Overall: Best cleansing balm I've ever tried.. 
ELEMIS-Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm,Malaysia,The Best!,"I have tried many cleansing balms and I must say this is the BEST.  It spreads luxuriously on the skin and very easily removes any type of water resistant make up especially stubborn mascara. Most importantly for me, it does not irritate my eyes at all and leaves my dry skin feeling soft and moisturized afterwards. No oily or sticky residue. It does have a strong lavender scent which smells divine to me, reminds me of a spa but if you are sensitive to strong scents you might not like this. It is also on the expensive side. The most expensive cleansing balm I've seen so far but when you try it you will feel the difference. It's definitely a splurge but worth the money.  Love it! "

INNISFREE-Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam EX,Australia,Velvety foam,You only need a tiny pea size bit and it foams up great. I actually use the foam as shave cream as well and liked it. Not overly drying for me. Downside is the smell is a bit basic (was expecting spa scent not chemist discount bin). I will try the green tea one next for this reason. 
INNISFREE-Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam EX,Australia,Holy Shi…grail,I bought this entirely on a whim. I needed a second face wash bc I felt that mine wasn’t doing what I needed it to. Well this truly strips and gets into my pores. I love the smell and the consistency as well. My face feels extra clean after use. I will admit I won’t use it daily because it’s harsher for my skin but it works like a gem especially after those long days of wearing make up and sweating then drying. 10/10 would recommend.
INNISFREE-Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam EX,Australia,So Good,I actually love this product I’ve had it for 2 weeks and it has made my skin feel amazing. I struggle with hormonal acne and sensitive skin and it doesn’t make me have any flare ups which is amazing for me considering literally everything makes my skin flare up. Plus the smell of this cleanser is DEVINE!

INNISFREE-Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam EX,Singapore,Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam Ex,It’s my first time using this product. It’s value for money - a small amount lathers into foam easily. It’s lightly scented and gives a refreshing and clean feel after use. I think this tube will last for awhile..
INNISFREE-Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam EX,New Zealand,Kaur ,"Don’t go in it’s price, it’s awesome product to cleanse your pores/face. The creme become into such a great soft foam after being in contact with water you won’t believe and cleanses every dirt out of your face. I used to double cleanse my face because of my makeup but with this cleanser just one pea size of product and that’s it. I am in love with it😍"
INNISFREE-Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam EX,New Zealand,Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam EX,This is a good size product and the value for money is great. Unfortunately I found this cleanser really stripped and dryed out my skin. Removed makeup okay but I wouldn’t repurchase. I have combination skin and would recommend this for oily skin only. 
INNISFREE-Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam EX,New Zealand,cheap and affordable ,this product has really helped me minimize my pores and its cheap and affordable. I would recommend this product if you have pores but not if you have severe pores but it really does help to clean out the pores.

xx"
INNISFREE-Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam EX,Singapore,Absolute value for money! ,"I’m a big Innisfree fan, and absolutely love this cleanser. Innisfree is absolute value for money. A deep pore cleanser, the texture is creamy, and it creates a nice lather. I use it about 2-3 times a week to exfoliate. Absolutely love it, and would highly recommend it. "
INNISFREE-Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam EX,New Zealand,Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam,"Good product, good size, good price but don't think I'd repurchase. Has some small beads? in it that strip your skin. I've never had dry skin before but this definitely made it feel parched. Not a bad product though just not for me."
INNISFREE-Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam EX,Australia,Drying not for combo sensitive skin,"Really wanted this fash wash to work but it is too drying even though it cleans well, it makes your skin oil up really fast through out the day and cause a lot unwanted breakouts. "
INNISFREE-Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam EX,New Zealand,M,I really love this product you only need a small amount to lather up in your hands then apply to your face when washed off leaves skin really soft and not feeling dry 
INNISFREE-Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam EX,Australia,unfortunately didn't suit me,I have used this face cleanser 2 times before writing this comment actually it cleans well but it dried out my face and it caused itchy especially in the cheek area. This is my experience with this product.   
INNISFREE-Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam EX,Australia,Fantastic product for oily skin,"Lovely, gentle cleanser that actually helps with the excess oil problem. Only a tiny amount is required to get a beautiful, foamy lather so it's great value for money. Leaves my face feeling fresh and clean but not stripped back like some other cleansers can."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Canada,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Cream Cleanser,"I love this cleanser, but for WINTER & FALL MORNINGS ONLY! I have oily skin but I live in a very dry place. I find that all I need in the mornings during the colder months is to basically wash off my skincare from the previous night. This cleanser is PERFECT for that! A gentle and moisturizing way to start the day. This really helped me combat the seasonal dryness I experience in the winter. I do really wish this product was better advertised for this purpose, it it really not suitable or enough for makeup removal or an evening cleanse."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Singapore,Undecided ,"I'm undecided over this cleanser, it's not bad and does a cleanser should do but I can't seem to love it. Still prefer my foaming cleanser. This cleanser feels like it takes a little more effort to wash off. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Canada,Great For Dry/Sensitive Skin,"As someone with very dry, sensitive skin, finding skincare/makeup that works is an endless battle. This product ticks off all the boxes - very moisturizing and luxurious without the irritation. I use it for the morning cleanse; it's not meant to remove makeup."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Canada,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Cream Cleanser,Doesn’t even take off your eye makeup. Nice texture and smell though.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Malaysia,Cream Cleanser,Non drying cleanser! The most hydrating cleanser that i have used in my life! Love how the cleanser dispense the right amount of cleanser for me every single time! 
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Australia,Cream Cleanser,so so so obsessed w kora's cream cleanser!! use this beauty morn & night for the softest face you will ever have!! most amazing product & really love miranda's ethos for using clean ingredients that still achieve that envious glow 
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Canada,Parfait!,"C'est le meilleur. Il est doux pour ma peau sèche et sensible, en plus d'être efficace. J'ai essayé tous les autres conseillés par Doctorly, Dr. Dray, Kassandra, Hyram, James Welch, Shereene Idriss.... et aucun ne bat celui-ci, alors j'ai décidé d'arrêter de chercher! Hihi!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Australia,gentle cleanser ,"Product feels like silk on the skin, suits sensitive skin, feels hydrating after use.However, wont get ride of makeup. Good if you have no issues with yourskin , wear no makeup. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Australia,Best,I do like it. If you have dry skin or sensitive skin then Kora Organics Cream Cleanser would be worth trying. I have dry skin and the cream cleanser works well for me. I prefer creamy cleansers.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,New Zealand,Amazing ,Wanted to try something different and this works wonder. Tried it and it was so good. Texture is so creamy and you dont need heaps of product. Will try more products from Kora.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Australia,Good morning cleanser ,"She’s 4 1/2 stars because it’s not revolutionary, just simple cleanser that is my fave to use first thing in the morning. I’ve lost count on how many times I’ve re-purchased her!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Singapore,First cream cleanser ,It’s my first time trying cream cleanser and it’s not too bad for an organic clean product. It is quite therapeutic to use and not stripping on skin. It’s not fantastic cleanser in my own opinion but good to use when I wanted something not drying on face after washing. 
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Australia,lovely product,"Absolutely love Kora Organics products. Been using this cleanser since it came out. (A couple years?) yes it is quite pricey but it lasts, as you only really need one pump when mixed with water. I love how soft it makes my skin feel. Great for sensitive and acne prone skin as well. One bottle lasts me a few months which is definitely worthit. I do have bad acne and the only con is it doesn’t really heal it or anything, but that’s not what this cleanser is made for. It’s great just to prevent your skin from getting worse and cleanse away those dirty pores. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Canada,Smells like bleach.,"LOVE Kora Organics, but this product isn't very good. It also smells like bleach."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Malaysia,Creamy Milk ,This product removes all the impurities in my skin when I wore make up. This cream cleanser is very important before we apply foaming cleanser because it is like a double cleanser that removes all the dirt that sticks on our facial skin after a long day of exposure. I really like the texture of creamy milk and the smell is so good. 
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Canada,"Love, love, love!","I’ve been using this cleanser for just over a month now and I’m loving how this makes my skin feel. It leaves my skin feeling moisturizer and supple, and the smell is nice - not very fragrant, just a nice, natural scent. I agree that this may not work best on heavy makeup days, however on those days, this would be a nice second cleanse as it really leaves your skin feeling beautiful. Doesn’t strip, doesn’t cause any skin irritation or breakouts whatsoever, and I find I don’t have to use that much in order to have enough to massage each area of my face and then rinse off. The bottle is great, too - easy to dispense. I would say if you are using this cleanser twice each day, you’ll get about 2 months out of one bottle. Can’t wait to try other Kora products!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Australia,"It’s ok , but not for me ","The cleanser is OK, I felt that it cleans my face, doesn’t strip away much that leave my skin dry like other harsh cleanser. The downside for me is it doesn’t foam much that I ended up using more. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Canada,Gentle and Effective,Purchased this on a whim while I was on vacation in California because I forgot my cleanser at home. I loved it! It was gentle enough for sensitive skin but still cleaned off all my makeup. The scent is light but pleasing. I will definitely repurchase this cleanser!
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Australia,gentle and effective ,"Soft and gentle on the skin, but effective in removing the days’ makeup, dirt and sunscreen. Perfect for morning and evening, and has a subtle and nice smell to it. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Malaysia,Creamy and gentle ,"Great if you are looking for a mild and gentle cleanser. Comes in 100ML which is perfect for travel. Does not have a strong scent. Suitable for dry/sensitive skin. However, it goes out of stock pretty fast. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Canada,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Cream Cleanser,"I’ve been searching for a clean face cleanser that works for my skin for several years now. I’ve struggled to find one that is gentle, doesn’t dry out my skin and helps me avoid break outs. This one is it for me. I also like that a little goes a long way."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Canada,best cleanser for dry irritated skin!,"I love this cleanser! It's so soft and soothing on the skin, and cleanses the face perfectly, leaving skin feeling fresh and soft. Also works greatly to remove makeup."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Canada,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Cream Cleanser,"I started using this product while living in Australia. I had super sensitive, combination acne prone skin in Canada and consistently had breakouts - but once i was in Aus and using this they completely went away. I thought maybe it had something to do with the weather but since i've been home (6 months) my skin has still been great. The only issue I have with it is that it doesn't remove makeup, so I use a remover before and cleanse with Kora after. I will definitely continue to buy this product, it is the only cleanser that my skin has really responded well to!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,,hydrating and organic ,"One of the better performing organic Cleansers. Very light and gentle and doesn't strip
Your skin. Also comes in  travel friendly size (100ml).if you like the clean and foaming cleanser feel, this is not for you. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,,sensitive skin,"This product is soft and lush against my sensitive skin. 
I use it in the morning. it's doesn't removed make up that easily but does provide a clean feel after using make up remover. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,,Not Sure How I Feel,"Back to using cream cleansers as I don’t wish to strip my face of its moisture with foam cleansers. Bought this to try. Not sure if I’m liking it being cream cleansers are products that need to take some time liking, at least for me. Doesn’t have a strong perfume scent so it’s great. Skin doesn’t feel tight even after washing my face twice with it so it’s great too. Not sure if once is able to cleanse my face well since I exercise and have got lots of sweat and oil on my face after as cream cleanser doesn’t produce any foam. A tad pricey for a cream cleanser. But also understood that it uses great ingredients."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Canada,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND A MUST!!!,"The best cleanser ever! I’ve been using Kora Organics products for almost 2 years now and I honestly LOVE it!

I have a dry and a bit sensitive skin and using this one is the best decision I’ve ever made. It so gentle, leaves my skin moisturized and very soft. I usually get acnes a couple of days after using new products but this one didn’t that’s why I’m sticking to it. I highly recommend it for sensitive and dry skin."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,,Excema friendly!,"This product helped with my excema, in conjunction with the rose mist and Hydrsting Moisturiser. I only use organic products and the price point is good, too."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,Canada,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Cream Cleanser,Unfortunately this cleanser does nothing for me. My nose feels bumpier than usual and I don’t find it does anything special. I do have oily skin so maybe this wasn’t targeted for my skin type. I also don’t enjoy the smell of it. I won’t be repurchasing.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,USA,Great product,"Is a great cleanser, definitely takes two pumps not one to wash off full coverage makeup. It makes my skin feel great and I didn’t have a reaction changing from my old face wash. The only thing it could improve on is its ability to remove mascara."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,USA,LOVE this cleanser,"I’m in love with this cleanser, I have terrible acne prone, verrrrrry dry skin. I did not buy this in hopes or helping my acne but ever since I have used this cleanser my skin hasn’t broken out at all, actually it’s been improving dramatically in ways I wasn’t expecting. It feels amazing while cleansing, so gentle. I was on the hunt for a clean cream cleanser because foam cleansers irritate me so badly. My face feels baby soft after and never tight, & the smell is so mild. I’m obsessed. My new go to I’m so grateful to have found this!! Couldn’t be happier"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Cream Cleanser,"This cleanser is the best product I ever used on my face. When you wash your face with it, your skin immediatly feels so soft and hydrated! Your skin feels so smooth and glowy!!! I won't use anything else on my face, I won't stop using that product. It really changed my skin!!! Get it now if you have dry and delicate skin, you won't regret it!!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Cream Cleanser,USA,so far so good,"I got this cleanser a week ago and so far it hasn’t broken me out, which is all I have been looking for in a cleanser. My skin is super sensitive to anything and everything but is loving this!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Australia,The best gel cleanser,"I have used many a cleansers in my time and buy far this would have to be my most favourite. It’s clean, it’s got beautiful packaging and it doesn’t strip the skin. It’s perfect."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,Miss,I really wanted to love this but I felt like it doesn’t do much. It doesn’t foam that much either if you use it with a Foreo Luna device. I do appreciate the packaging though with the pump!
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,mrs,Excellent cleanser smell so good very satisfied. I would buy it again. I have sensitive skin with redness. My skin has got better since using Kora organics. I recommended for anyone who has trouble skin. Pimples or any skin conditions.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,Great organic facial cleanser after Estlle & Thild,"Any certified organic skincare is good for me. Since Estelle & Thild, this is another alternative. Tried Fresh before, but not suitable for my skin."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,Kora Facial Wash,"Cleans well, but it is quite stripping on the skin when compared to Fresh Soy. Would not be re-purchasing as its quite costly too. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Australia,beautiful cleanser,"I don’t wear heavy makeup and so I’ve been looking for a cleanser that was cruelty free and gentle on my skin. This has been perfect for me. I’ve can use it morning and night without it being overly drying. The only downside is that it doesn’t remove lip products very well. I have to remove it with a remover to do a perfect cleanse. Other than that, will definitely be repurchasing :)"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,Gentle on the skin (oily-normal skin) ❤️,"Lasted me about 4 months (i used 2 pumps daily). Before this I used harsh cleansers, & when I switch to this, I could see a big difference. Love how it does not leave my skin feeling overly cleansed. My skin became smoother & plumper. I used it with a facial sponge.

However, i don’t think it can fully remove makeup. 

I highly recommend this cleanser if you are looking for a gentle cleanser. Its quite expensive :’) but a little goes a long way, & with the results I’m seeing, I will keep on repurchasing it❤️❤️❤️

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,love this!,"I needed something without fragrance, and this pretty much does it’s job.  I’m very used to fragrant cleansers though, so it was a bit weird to use initially. But My skin feels clean and refreshed after using this; doesn’t feel tight. Would definitely recommend if you’re looking for a cleanser from the clean beauty section. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,foaming cleanser,"My face feels clean and great after using it, it’s gentle and effective, it has a pleasant lovely subtle smell. It works amazingly & definitely recommended 👍🏻"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Australia,Great Cleanser ,"Beautiful  on  the  skin,  face  full  of  makeup   and  felt  super  clean  after  1  wash.      Didn’t feel  that  I  needed  to  double  cleanse. Amazing  smell












"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,love it ,"Love this product! 2nd time repurchasing it but I think I might switch to the cream cleanser and try it! As I love something abit more hydrating. But nothing to complain 
"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Philippines,BEST FACE WASH EVER & WILL LAST LONG,"I have been using face wash since I was 12... Now that I’m 24 (and 30+ tried of different face wash brands later), I’ve finally found the best for me! 5 stars for the ingredients, 5 stars for quality, 5 stars for value money, 5 stars for the packaging! The amount you get in 1 bottle is also so so generous. Will last you a long time. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Australia,must buy ,"I’ve been using this cleanser now for over a year and it has been the only cleanser product I’ve used (in my adult life) that has actually cleared up my skin and not plagued it haha (I’m sensitive/combo). 

I find 2 little pumps enough for me to wash my face with (twice daily) and it lasts a few months as a result! Very much recommend this to everyone :)"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Singapore," Clean ingredients, gentle, yet does the job!","It is SO HARD to find facial cleaners that do the job and have clean ingredients (esp one without Phenoxyethanol, fragrance and all the nasty stuff). Have tried a few and this one definitely works! Face feels clean yet not dry. And my eye lashes have stopped dropping (due to the harsh chemicals) that happens with most other facial cleansers! Only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars is that it can't get rid of blackheads; u prolly need a separate scrub."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,Clean and soft skin,I really like this product for its ability to clean my normal to dry skin without stripping. I don’t feel like I need to apply moisturizer right after. The scent is kind of unusual for a natural product as it smells a little bit medicinal but you get used to it. Would recommend. 
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Australia,A favourite,"I’ve loved and used Kora Organics since they were established. I have bad acne and sensitive, dry skin but this cleanser gives me no reaction, leaves it smooth and refreshed. You also only need a pea sized amount which will make it last for months. Although it is pricey you don’t need to use much at all and like I said it lasts longer in the long run. I advise you to try the trial/sample/travel bundles of the different cleansers before you splurge on a big size. As each one are created for different skin types. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,Gentle,I have sensitive skin but this is gentle enough. It also doesn't strip off the moisture and foams up nicely.  2-3 pumps is enough for each usage it can last for quite awhile. The only downside is that it smells a little weird. 
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,Pretty good for a organic cleanser. $$...mmm? ,I don’t usually change my cleansers but decided to try the Kora Organics Foaming Cleanser. Been using it for alittle over a month. If you have sensitive skin...I think this product is recommended (for all skin types). It produces tiny bubble foams when washing in circular motions. It doesn’t harm your skin or feel “thick” in anyway. Your face doesn’t feel dirty and your skin feels light. If you use it regularly with one pump per day/night wash...it should last you for 2 months (I’m at half tube now). Maybe for some individuals...you can stretch up to 3months depending on your usage. $43 for an organic cleanser...doesn’t come as a surprise. But I would agree for 100ml is abit pricey. 
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Malaysia,Gentle to the skin,"This is the best gentle cleanser when you wake up in the morning and you know you'll cleanse your face again for your afternoon workout during this MCO period.
It's light and perfect for beautiful morning or at night when you need to relax!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,Singapore,Loving it,Was using cetaphil prior to this. Bought this because its Organic and gentle. No harsh chemicals and doesn't strip moisture off your skin after every wash. Great for sensitive skin. After using this for a week I noticed my skin is looking akot more healthy?
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,,Amazing!!,This cleanser makes my face feel so fresh and clean after use plus it foams up so well with just one pump! Love the smell of it and will definitely buy again :)
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,,Cleanses and smells good,"This cleanser leaves a fresh, clean feeling on the skin without feeling dry or tight. Loves the smell too. Will definitely keep buying this and try other products in the range. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,,best gentle clenser!!!,"i always struggle to find a gentle clenser that isnt harsh on my skin, but this one is so nice feeling and makes my face feel so smooth after a couple of days using it i already see a diffrence. will purchase again!!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,,suits my skin,like this cleanser alot. the sensitive skin cleanser from Korea doesn't seem to leave my skin feeling cleansed but this does the job without drying my skin out. have noticed fewer breakouts since using and love the natural ingredients

I will definetly buy this product again. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,USA,AMAZINGGGG,Absolutely love it! I have oily/sensitive skin. I break out at the drop so a hat and my skin just always feels oily/greasy. This cleanser completely evens everything out! My skin has never felt this good! My new obsession!! Highly recommend!
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Foaming Cleanser,USA,Nothing Special,"Suspiciously light tube with a push pump dispenser, the cleanser smells uninteresting and rather unpleasant.It doesn't really ""foam up"" as advertised, only light bubbles.  No difference after 2 weeks of use, skin drys and then rapidly becomes oily (even when well moisturized). The price point and clean ingredients are the only positive aspects of this product."
BURT'S BEES-Sensitive Facial Cleansing Towelettes,Malaysia,wipes,"The material of this really thin and the smell not really good, but i love function of this wipes on my face, when i clean my face with this wipes, make my face more refreshing. Overall 3/5. "
BURT'S BEES-Sensitive Facial Cleansing Towelettes,Singapore,Don’t Like,"It is moist and good to use for make up remover however the smell is too strong and very strange. For me, i like sweet smell or no smell. So, if for ppl like me, I am not recommended for this product coz smell is strange. "
BURT'S BEES-Sensitive Facial Cleansing Towelettes,,Ms.,"The scent is actually a little off for me. I really have sensitive skin that’s why I bought this one. However, I experienced redness while using this and I’m not sure if it’s because of its contents or because of pressure I put while cleaning my face. The redness fades away for few minutes, nevertheless. I like that it actually leaves my face smoother and clear."
BURT'S BEES-Sensitive Facial Cleansing Towelettes,,"moist and clean, but strange smell","The towels are moist eventhough I used it only after buying 3 months ago.  It doesn't give a lingering shine or scent like some other facial tissue. The scent is a bit strange however, not sure how to place it. "
BURT'S BEES-Sensitive Facial Cleansing Towelettes,,uggh no,its funny how it specifically says for sensitive skin but then it broke me out? I like the cucumber one better which is the one with the green packaging 
BURT'S BEES-Sensitive Facial Cleansing Towelettes,,easy go,Just put this set inside your handbag and make it on the go. doesn't consume so much space and alsoI I can just take off my make up anywhere without straight away wash it with cleanser and yet feel comfortable along the way.
BURT'S BEES-Sensitive Facial Cleansing Towelettes,,my favorite to-go makeup remover,"gentle, no scent, 1 piece does the job the remove the makeup of my whole face, including eye and lip makeup. really convenient when you are on travel. hassle free and wouldnt worry that i will spill the conventional eye makeup remover. and the best thing, i no need to bring cotton pad too! i even used it as a refreshing wipe/cleansing wipe when i was on a night plane."
BURT'S BEES-Sensitive Facial Cleansing Towelettes,,Burt's Bees Sensitive Facial Cleansing Towelettes,The towelettes were quite dry and I really had to rub it into my skin to use it as a make up remover. In the end I resorted to using some other form of make up remover. It's probably not to be used as a makeup removing wipe and more of a refreshing towelette...but it also didn't leave my skin with a refreshing feel. Will not purchase again 
BURT'S BEES-Sensitive Facial Cleansing Towelettes,,$$$$$$,"Did not realise how expensive this was (per sheet) when I bought it!! :OOOO does its job for face makeup, but mascara and liquid lipstick do not come off as easy with these wipes. Also, the packaging is bulky and it kind of leaves a slight tingling sensation on my face for some reason.. "
BURT'S BEES-Skin Nourishment Gentle Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Convenient and gentle on skin,"The scent is very slightly botanical/herbal-like but that doesn't bother me. I like the ease of usage, just 1~2 pumps is enough foam to cleanse and my skin does not dry out thereafter. I would prefer if the bottle was clear so I can see how much liquid is left as I use it."
BURT'S BEES-Skin Nourishment Gentle Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,Really good cleanser,"This is one of my all time favourite cleansers. Even though it's a foam cleanser, not drying. It cleanses properly and has a mild fragrance. Unfortunately, it's quite expensive in Malaysia compared to US but I got it during the 40% off sales and the price ended up the same as in US. "
BURT'S BEES-Skin Nourishment Gentle Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Not for me ,I dont like the smell . Sorry Just nothing great or special about this cleanser . I have breakouts after using it . Just disappointed on this cleanser . 
BURT'S BEES-Skin Nourishment Gentle Facial Cleanser,,Good stuff,"For the price and the quality ingredients, this is a go-to cleanser. Good for all skin types and I strongly recommend this product to anyone seeking brighter, youthful skin."
BURT'S BEES-Orange Essence Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Love it as it makes my skin supple.,"First purchase and I'm loving it. Unfortunately it is frequently out of stock. It does not dry up my skin. i love the orange citrus smell. After washing my face, it does not feel oily or dry. However, it makes my skin soft and supple. I recommended this to my mom and sister and they love it too."
BURT'S BEES-Orange Essence Facial Cleanser,Malaysia,nice orangy,"Just tried for two weeks and i can say it is suitable for me. I have sensitive and dry skin. Easily to remove your light makeup, orange-scent (which i really like it), and it does not irritate your skin. Yes, it has natural ingrendients which i like the most👍👍👍👍👍👍"
BURT'S BEES-Orange Essence Facial Cleanser,,it too natural ,it have texture like cethaphill cleaser i do like becase he smell of orang it has but im not kind of comfortable because i feel after clease it make my skin oily 
BURT'S BEES-Orange Essence Facial Cleanser,,BEST MORNING CLEANSER,I use it in the mornings and it wakes up my skin! Leaves my face plump and moisturized. Has a nice orange scent not too overpowering. It doesnt irritate your skin but doesnt really leave it glowing. It can also remove makeup. Oil based 
BURT'S BEES-Orange Essence Facial Cleanser,,nice scent ,"It has a nice citrus scent and if you a lover of citrus smell, you would totally enjoy using this cleanser. I could see improvement on my skin in terms of clarity and brightening. However, it is not convenient in terms of traveling as it is watery"
BURT'S BEES-Orange Essence Facial Cleanser,,Horrible product ,"Orange Essence Facial Cleanser has more than orange essence; it irritates skin with orange and rosemary oils and is not recommended. It isn’t even a very good cleanser, making it a waste of time and money."
