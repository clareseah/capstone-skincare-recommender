SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,couldn‚Äôt find any better than this,"Perfect sunscreen for my under eye area! I‚Äôm concerned about premature aging there ...and have searched for a sunscreen that smooths under concealer, doesn‚Äôt irritate, and stays put. This is it! (I‚Äôm reluctant to try it all over my face because it‚Äôs high-silicone...which is likely to clog my pores...But for under eyes, it‚Äôs perfect.)"

I'm a brown woman who's been looking for the perfect sunscreen for years, and this is IT, folks. it is gamechanging. the formula makes the sunscreen translucent for no ghostly cast, gel-like for fuller coverage and with this sort of fine grainy feel for a matte finish & fragrance free for the sensitive skin folks. I have combi/oily skin and it hasn't irritated my skin or caused breakouts or anything of the sort. I am SOLD and I'm not turning back. if you're a brown Asian woman like me who's been looking for the perfect sunscreen for too long, just get on this one. take my word for it. it is pricey but it is worth it."

Fast absorbing and not sticky at all. Best part skin looks natural like. 
"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 50ml,"this looks fine on the skin but the texture of it makes my face feel dirty/greasy. it doesn‚Äôt make my makeup pill, but it does seem to speed up the breakdown of my foundation/concealer."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,All-time fav,"I never looked back since! I use this for gym, and even underneath my makeup - which BTW works like a primer. And gives semi-matte finish. I love how it doesn‚Äôt give off a white cast. OILY SKIN GYALS, get it."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Cult classic for a reason ,"This remains one of the easiest sunscreens to use, it feels like nothing, gives a lovely matte finish, and it doesn‚Äôt give you any sort of a cast (for reference I am medium brown skintone). Main problem is the price is ridiculously steep for the amount you get."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Depends on texture,"I love the fact it is see through, but I don't enjoy the texture of putting it on. It has a velvety feel, which some people may like, but to me it just feels oily."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 50ml,fine under makeup as a primer occasionally but using regularly broke me out bad
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Good sunscreen but too expensive!,I definitely like this sunscreen but the value for money is very less. There are so many similar sunscreens out there who do the job which are priced less or offer more qty.
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,fav everyday sunscreen,"blends well, wears light, clear on skin, non greasy after application. a very good makeup base. this is my go-to chemical sunscreen. texture might feel weird to first time users on application but that 'oily' feel goes away. "
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Love this! ,Really like how lightweight and non-greasy the formulation of this sunblock is. It absorbs quickly into the skin too and makes for a great base for makeup. 
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Amazing,"True to it's name ""Unseen"". Very smooth texture and non greasy formula. It does actually ehat it says. I recently introduce this to my skincare routine and perfectly satisfied. Apply everyday before stepping out and then apply make up.

SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Disappointed,Disappointed after hearing lots of people rave about this sunscreen. It feels nice going on however you can‚Äôt wear it with makeup at all.
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Ms ,"If the SPF could be 50 PA, it will be perfect. Lightweight and easy to apply on face, gives the skin a good sunscreen protection invisibly. Good product. 
"

SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 50ml,"This is the perfect sunscreen makeup primer that I love using daily. However, if I need true sun protection for a day out in the sun (i.e beach, hiking, picnic, etc), this alone will not be enough. So with that said, do I recommend using it as a daily primer with added benefits of some sun protection? Yes. Would I recommend this as main sun protection? No."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,love it,"My skin type is dry and sensitive, and this product works perfectly for me. I dislike the feeling of having products on my face but this does not feel oily or have a film on my skin. Love love love this."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 50ml,"I love this product. It is so light and airy, and truly is ‚Äúunseen‚Äù - no white streaks, you can‚Äôt tell you‚Äôre wearing sunscreen. It‚Äôs so tough to find a good sunscreen especially gentle enough for the face, and this does it! And a little goes a long way"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Great for combo or oily skin,"I had the mini one to give it a try and I loved it! It‚Äôs not greasy, super light, no scent, and it gives a glow look to your skin without looking too shinny, if you have oily or combo skin you‚Äôre going to love it!"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Needs no introduction,"This product is a winner. A HG of Supergoop. Glides well on skin, it has that velvety matte look and feel. It acts as primer as well. Blends well with most foundation. Love it!"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"BUY IT! great primer, too.","Long story short; Pairs well with my skin routine and works well under my foundation as a primer. No irritation and is an awesome primer. Makes skin feel nice. No smell, feels nice on the skin. Does its job. Nice matte finish and very easy on the skin :) Cons; cannot re-apply over makeup, makes my face cakey. I want to try the other products like the mist or brush to re-apply.


Detailed review; I have combo skin and I am avid make-up user in Miami. I use a drunk elephant skin routine (Protini Polypeptide Cream, C-Firma Fresh Day Serum, B-Hydra Intensive Hydration Serum, Marula Oil) under this sunscreen primer and it works sooo well with the Lanc√¥me Teint Idole Long Wear Foundation and Tarte Shape Tape concealer. I've also paired it with the Maybelline Fit Me foundation and works well, too! 

It goes on LOVELY on the skin and is a great primer. It feels like a matte film that dissolves into the skin after a minute. My foundation also has sunscreen, it pairs well. Its been nice to wear with my make-up routine. The only con is, I cannot re-apply it over my make-up because it gives it a cakey texture. The cost is very high for me but after using it daily (pea size goes a long way!) it has been a great bang for my buck. I purchased it in March of 2022 and still have some in my bottle in October of 2022! I don't have to buy more for another month or so. No skin reaction at all! Nice matte finish. Buy it! :)"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,must have,non greasy! glides well. doesn't give acne. doesn't irritate.
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Unseen sunscreen,"The texture of this sunscreen is like wax. So when applied on the skin is like applying a layer of wax. I personally do not like that feeling. At the same time, I find it oily as well. Maybe because my skin is very oily to begin with. "
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Too Oily,"I looked this product. But my complaint is that it is way too oily, but it could be a help to dry skin. It‚Äôs a bit better when shaken."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,feels like a film on skin,product is pretty easy to apply and blend. makes a good primer. and its true to its name. so far it does goes well with SG weather but unfortunately this product is not to for me.
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,must-have in my morning routine,love love loveeee this sunscreen! I have oily skin and this was lightweight didn‚Äôt make me shiny throughout the day and worked great under makeup!
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Best sunscreen for all skin tyoe,"Totally clear, weightless and scentless with a velvety finish, this innovative, antioxidant-rich multitasker has a unique oil-free formula that glides onto skin while providing broad spectrum SPF 40 protection against UV and infrared radiation and helping to filter blue light ‚Äî all with major skincare benefits in the mix! Doubles as a makeup-gripping primer under foundation when you want a little more coverage, or on its own if you want a more natural look. It‚Äôs a totally game-changing way to wear sunscreen daily!"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Philippines,Ms.,"Love this, grips my makeup and it‚Äôs kinda velvety. Good for sun protection too! Love how my base looks like when i put it on top of this. Definitely worth the price."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Ms,"Unlike the rest, this sunscreen is a bit oily for me and my face became oily very fast. It also feels abit too heavy around my T-zone area. As this does not really suit my skin, may not repurchase again "
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,My tried and true ride or die!,"I have extremely sensitive skin that does not react well to sunscreens. I have tried many, many sunscreens (Josie Maran, Beauty of Joseon, Dr. Jart, Fenty Skin, even other Supergoop sunscreens), and they have all left my skin red, irritated, and itchy. This is the only sunscreen I've ever used that hasn't irritated my skin. It has a very unique texture (similar to the Benefit Porefessional) that is very blurring and smoothing, while still being soft and hydrating. It has great packaging and little to no scent (at least that I can smell). Supergoop knocked it out of the park for the sensitive skin folks on this one, and I hope they never reformulate."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Philippines,super!!!,"i've repurchased this over and over again. it is oerfect under makeup. perfect when you're under the sun. and perfect for kids as well. no irritation, no smell, ni oily feeling. this has been my forever go to sunscreen. "
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,I love it ,"As the name says, it is unseen. Love this as a makeup base. Easy to reapply. Love the texture. As an oily skin girl I appreciate that I don‚Äôt look like a grease ball after applying the sunscreen. Would I repurchase it? Yes definitely have done so multiple times . ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Love this sunscreen."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Great product!,The sunscreen actually works! Tends to get a bit oily in very humid climatic conditions but does a wonderful job of protecting the skin while being very light.
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Love this sunscreen!,"This sunscreen is completely transparent and does its one and only job. I wear it pretty much daily. I apply it after my usual day skincare products (toner, serums, cream) and before putting on foundation. No irritation or weird colors. Holy grail facial sunscreen right here!"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,don‚Äôt really like the texture ,"Bought this cos my friend recommended this to me. It squeezes out like a Matt gel but once u start massaging it in it feels very oily and once you are done it feels like nth on the skin. I have no complains about the product, just personally I don‚Äôt like the oily feeling I get whenever I rub it in. "
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,matte sunblock,This sunblock is not really suitable for dry skin. Instantly skin look matte after applied to face even after rich moisturiser. Will try other type from this brand next time. 
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Go too facial sunscreen ,I got this for my partner and he loves it so much! Easy to use and he likes how it doesn‚Äôt make his face look shiny. The reason it‚Äôs not 5star because it‚Äôs expensive haha
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,worthy,This sunscreen is awesome. I‚Äôm using this product more than 3 months and it is still not finish yet. The best thing about this sunscreen is that it leave no scent and not oily at all. 
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,holy grail! ,"My oily-acne prone skin just cannot with other sunscreen. Im not sure im already at how many bottle. The only downside is the price and it‚Äôs getting expensive over the years. Tried to google and purchased any sunscreen that is dupe in the pharmacy, but i always go back to this one."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Supergoop!,Always love this brand's sun screen. This particular one is great as it's light weight and does not leave my skin dry nor irritate it. But I personally prefer the other one that makes my skin appear a little dewy after applying. Supergoop is really super good!
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Best There Is,"If you're looking for sunscreen for under makeup, this is probably the best you'll find. It's not greasy, absorbs fast, and has the texture that can be comparable to Smashbox's Photo Finish primer (like a dry gel). It's great as a primer or just on it's own. I don't get any negative effects from it, just protection I need."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,A definite for facial sunscreen!,Absolutely love this sunscreen its light and it does its job!
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Does What It Says,"I love to use this sunscreen during the summer. It has a skin-like finish and is never shiny. It doesn't feel heavy on the skin and it doesn't interfere with the way my makeup looks. I also wear it during winter sometimes, butI have dry skin so I like to opt for something with a little more moisture during that time. I highly recommend!"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Keep going back to it,I have pretty much every Supergoop product and this is the one I keep going back to. It just makes my skin look better and is really the perfect primer for both powder and liquid foundations.
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,There‚Äôs definitely better out there,The consistency is weird and I feel like it scratched my face when I put it on. my face started to break out into a bunch of tiny little bumps and some hives. I didn‚Äôt like the matte effect either. Plus the price is way too high.
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Love this so much,"This is hands down the best sunscreen I‚Äôve ever used! It‚Äôs so light and sinks in the skin immediately, you don‚Äôt feel it,yet you know it‚Äôs there doing it‚Äôs job! I will repurchase for sure!
Will"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,THE BEST SPF/PRIMER IN ONE!,"It truly is invisible spf. Goes on like silky velvet drying to a natural finish, doubles as a make-up primer, it grabs and holds make-up in place while leaving face feeling fantasticly soft & smooth"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,super light,I was stopping wearing sunscreen for years (I know I shouldn‚Äôt do that) because most of the sunscreen that I used was really greasy. This sunscreen is really game changer for me as it is really light and I don‚Äôt feel anything when I wear it! Love it ‚ù§Ô∏è
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not thrilled,I was hoping to like this but it seems to change how my foundation sits on my skin and not in a good way. It goes on nicely otherwise.
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,must have,"I absolutely love this. I always sweat through sunscreen when I put it on my face and it always gets into my eyes, this was the first sunscreen that immediately absorbed into my skin without being greasy and it stayed even though I was sweating, I will never go back to any other sunscreen"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,GOOD!,"This is a good sunscreen, it didn‚Äôt break me out or cause any irritation but the feeling left on my skin was a bit more of a primer feel. Its also very hard to get out once you‚Äôve reached the end of the tube."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,loooove but expensive,"This sunscreen is so nice and it has a balm-like texture! I tried it out about a month ago, and it was so smooth and velvety! I would wish that the price would be lower, but other than that it‚Äôs a super great sunscreen!"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,It's ok,"I tried the mini size before purchased the big one. It was OK but after using for a while, I feel that it is very slippery, like I got another layer on my face. Now I'm trying to look for a new kind of sunscreen.."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,A must!!!!!,"I love this! My face is so matte, it is a must for me!"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Bottle comes half empty!,I am a big fan of the product itself but the bottle comes half full and lasts about a month at best (using dermatologist recommended 1 tsp of spf). There are much more affordable sunscreens that last much longer so please save your money.
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,the BEST sunscreen for oily skin and makeup,"I love this product so much and I can't find anything like it. I am really not a fan of the price but it works so well with my oily skin (not greasy, honestly don't really notice it's there). it's also an excellent makeup primer"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Most have for protection!,Love this sunscreen.  It's great as a makeup primer with no shine.  Projects the skin.  No scent.  My third time buying.  MUST BUY!
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Eye itching,"Eyes itches a lot. I think I rubbed it on the eyes too by mistake and it was just horrible. It‚Äôs very smooth in skin, but I wish they had spf 50"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Philippines,fave sunscreen ,This is my favorite sunscreen so far. It really lives up to its name and doesn‚Äôt interfere with make up even with retouches. No sticky feeling or residue and zero white caste. Love this. 
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,clear sunscreen ,"Its in the name of the product, it is really unseen. the texture is reminiscent of a silicon primer but a little oilier. It works for my oily skin, the cons are the sunscreen smell and the price for me"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not for fair skin,"I bought this sunscreen to use everyday. I started to notice sun spots on my face maybe 8 years ago and it was advised I wear sunscreen daily. The active ingredients to look for are Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. This sunscreen does not have these active ingredients, they are inactive. This did not provide the protection that I needed. I am choosing another option that goes on more milky white and be a better protection for my skin."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Added to my daily routine,"For awhile now I kept seeing posts of this product but I was using neutrogena sunscreen. So when it ran out I decided to give this a try. Not disappointed at all except for that I didn‚Äôt switch sooner! It applies nicely, no smell & my makeup can sit on top with out breaking apart.  Bought the sample just in case but I will be back for the big one."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Holy grail,"My all time favorite sunscreen! and it doubles as a primer for makeup. If you don‚Äôt like greasy sunscreen and want one that dosent pill, I highly recommend this one."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Sunscreen like a primer.,This has the same consistency as a clear primer such as Smashbox. It‚Äôs perfect for sun protection under makeup. Completely unique
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,It‚Äôs Transparent! ,"So far, this is one of the best sunscreen that I‚Äôve used. It‚Äôs literally transparent upon application and it‚Äôs super lightweight. The texture is great as well and it‚Äôs super easy to use"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Try at your own risk,"I really like this sunscreen because it doesn't leave any residue, is light weight and leaves a flawless finish but it made me break out really bad. My skin was clearing up but after using this sunscreen for the first time, my skin started to break out like crazy on my face I typically don't have acne. Will still continue to see how it is on my skin overtime because it is on the more pricey side and I wouldn't want this to go to waste!"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Philippines,best sunscreen ever,"i tried almost all sunblocks becauae my work entails staying out in the sun at exrended hours  so far, this has the best texture, finish, consistency (not greasy), lightweight can be used as.makeup primer, a little goes a long way. i's kinda pricey though"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Better sunscreens out there,"I gave it a try for the whole summer and liked it at first. But then the heat got to me and I feel like I made my makeup melt. Realistically, only protected you for like 40 minutes. It also made me break out."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not for me,"It leaves my skin feeling dry and I did not like the feeling, it was oily but matte at the same time."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Velvety feel,I love this sunscreen product! It leaves your skin feeling soft and velvety while protecting it from the sun. 
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 50ml,Horrible!!! Made me break out like a teenager! Never again! Avoid this one if you have sensitive skin!
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 50ml,I have been using this product for a couple weeks and am loving it as part of my new morning routine. The consistency reminds me of the smashbox primer I used years ago. Applies and stays great on my oily skin!
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Just buy it!,Just buy it. I took this with me to New York and definitely did it‚Äôs job. Went to the beach out there with this on and my nose this time around didn‚Äôt get burned as usual. You need this!! I just wish i had bought the body lotion also! since i was sun burned
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not right for my skin,"I heard that this product was great to wear under makeup. Although I haven't tried doing that yet, it probably is because it is extremely mattifying. Unfortunately, this is also what I don't like about it. My skin feels uncomfortably dry after I put it on. It has a very weird texture, and after wearing it for a week straight I was quite disenchanted. On the plus side, like all Supergoop products, it is cruelty-free and reef-safe. I absolutely adore this brand and use a LOT of its products, but I won't buy this one again."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not the best for Oily skin,"I have oily skin, and this sunscreen gives you a glow so I just look like I‚Äôm sweating. Take the time to work it into your skin to avoid piling. I feel like it might work for dry skin, will be trying the mineral ones next."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,sunscreennnn,"amazing product! love how i can use this as a primer! 2 in 1! transparent application no white cast! would recommend to anyone that is trying out sunscreen. it can be alittle pricey tho! shes a 10 but she‚Äôs expensive, 7/10
"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,my favourite sunblock,"Many2 times purchase sunscreen from supergoop. Unseen, glow or matte sunscreen. Love all the sunscreens. It suits my skin well. This time i‚Äôm purchase 20ml size to easily bring it out to travel."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Poor Clogger,"It blends in beautifully with your skin, which is the reason I tried to make this work multiple times. Unfortunately, every time I‚Äôve used this product I‚Äôd wake up with white heads the next morning."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,It's ok. I'm not sure if 40 min is average ?,"can't really wear this under make up, as it's a serum and pilled on me. I would certainly wear this alone, over a moisturizer."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,sunscreen,All time best sunscreen from the high end.. Supergoop did an amazing job.. No white cast and blends seamlessly.. I love this and with so many other finishes just wow.. Go grabs urs guyz..
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,You can buy it if you want to take the risk,"It's probably good sunscreen for many people, but not for me. This got me pimples every time that I used it."
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Worth the money!!,This is my third repurchase! I have yet to be sunburnt on my face this summer because of this product! It sinks into the skin very nice and overall is a 10/10 in my book and my moms!
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,THE BEST,I use every day on top of moisturizer & put foundation over the unseen sunscreen. My skin is sensitive- no break outs ever. I've gone through several tubes. I never have pilling at all when I use this product. To me it feels light & not heavy at all. Amazing- absolutely love it.
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Must have!,"I wear this everyday and it never breaks me out. I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin and I never have any issues. I use it as a makeup primer too. This product is a daily must have!!"
SUPERGOOP!-Unseen Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Pills REALLY BAD,"This sunscreen pills REALLY BAD if you try to wear anything on top of it, and it sometimes pills if you have other skin care underneath it too.

SHISEIDO-Global Suncare The Perfect Protector SPF 50+/PA++++,Singapore,love it!,"One of the best sunscreens I‚Äôve ever used cause there‚Äôs literally no white cast at all. Only downside is that it‚Äôs not a fully physical sunscreen so if you apply too much especially around the eye area, it could sting abit. Also abit on the pricey side but was able to get this at 20% off."

SHISEIDO-Global Suncare The Perfect Protector SPF 50+/PA++++,Malaysia,Great for the tropics and outdoors,"Second bottle I‚Äôm purchasing of this because I just love it so much. I have oily to combination skin type and I do a lot of outdoor sports and also sweat a lot since I‚Äôm based in the more humid region of Malaysia and this stays on the face leaving it matte the whole day. So impressed. I do admit that it is a product that really sticks on, so I would usually wipe face down with miscellar cleansing water before cleansing with face wash. But at least I know I‚Äôm getting my money‚Äôs worth by not being able to wipe it off with just a swipe after sweating. & the best of all it did not cause me any breakouts. Smells like sunscreen but with its own twist. Texture is liquid based which makes it easy to apply evenly. With just two fingers worth of product, it is enough to cover my face and neck. A bottle have last me for 3.5 months. Now this is a product true to all what it says, and I think you definitely need to give this a try."

"

SHISEIDO-Global Suncare The Perfect Protector SPF 50+/PA++++,Singapore,May require more tries,"Really wanted to enjoy this on first use as it‚Äôs so difficult to find a sunscreen that wouldn‚Äôt pill and doesn‚Äôt smell like chemicals. This smelled pleasant and didn‚Äôt pill under makeup. However, it did turn into a strange yellow colour! The yellow colour residue also transferred onto and stained my disposable mask. Not sure if it‚Äôs due to oxidation, mask-wearing during this pandemic season, or if the product is simply defective. I didn‚Äôt wear any form of makeup on top of the sunscreen so was surprised this happened. Perhaps I‚Äôll have a more objective review once we can go mask-free and hopefully it‚Äôs just the mask-wearing causing this!"
SHISEIDO-Global Suncare The Perfect Protector SPF 50+/PA++++,Malaysia,the smell :),"it's clear, doesn't have any tint so you can always layer sth else on top, I was most surprised by the smell! whatever tech it has, yes, that's the drawing point, but for me, it was the smell. it smells so good and it stays so I keep smelling it. it is a bit powdery on my skin but it's ok"

SHISEIDO-Global Suncare The Perfect Protector SPF 50+/PA++++,Singapore,So-so product given the price ,"Almost nearly identical to Anessa sunblock (which is also manufactured by Shiseido) but this sunblock has an oilier finish and less effective in controlling shine throughout the day.

SHISEIDO-Global Suncare The Perfect Protector SPF 50+/PA++++,Singapore,Too drying,"This sunscreen feels good when you apply it due to the velvet finish.

SHISEIDO-Global Suncare The Perfect Protector SPF 50+/PA++++,Singapore,Ok product,See many good reviews for this but I guess it doesn‚Äôt suit me that well. It‚Äôs lightweight and absorbs well but skin is still oily after few hours. Overall still a decent product. 
SHISEIDO-Global Suncare The Perfect Protector SPF 50+/PA++++,Singapore,Love the texture ,"Love how it feels on my skin after application, not greasy at all!

SHISEIDO-Global Suncare The Perfect Protector SPF 50+/PA++++,Singapore,Holy Grail sunscreen,"Keeps your face matte throughout the day but doesn‚Äôt dry it out, a decent base under makeup, lightweight and does not change your skin tone either.

SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,great as sun protection and as a primer,"This is such a good sunscreen for no make up days. The sunscreen act as a primer and because it is also tinted and matte, it can be used alone without any foundation. Just add some gloss to your look and you are good to go!!!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Meh,"Got this specifically bcs I‚Äôm breastfeeding & we have limited options for sunscreens. I love the application on this. It comes out as a powdery texture instead of liquid. However, it certainly does dries out your skin more. But I guess that‚Äôs supposed to happen when it‚Äôs a mattifying sunscreen "
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,good for oily skin,"I really like supergoop suncreens..one of the best on the market‚Ä¶this matte spf is nice for oily skin; however, I do feel it can feel quite drying mid day‚Ä¶face can feel a bit tight..at initial application, it leaves a subtle pink hue on the face but that disappears after a while‚Ä¶"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,matte screen,Really love it and recommended if you have oily skin. I used it on my oily warm tone skin and get the amazing results. Sometimes I used it instead of foundation.

SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,favourite ,"I have oily, acne prone and sensitive skin but this product is suitable for me. Previously, I dreaded applying sunscreen as it is usually sticky, shiny etc. With this mattescreen, I am looking forward to applying it. It gives a velvety finishing. I would suggest using a non-water based moisturiser underneath it. There is a some minimal coverage due to tinted. Although the matte effect lasted for 3-4 hours for me, I am still satisfied. 
Overall, I really love this product!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Causes small pimples,"I‚Äôm sensitive to this product. I think it‚Äôs the tinted ingredient that causes me small pimples on my forehead. Perhaps it‚Äôs not suitable for me. I had to return the item for a full refund. Also, if you have sweaty palms, it will affect the effectiveness of the product."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Mineral Mattescreen,I used this product long ago and it works well on my skin. But i stopped after it went out of stock for very long time. I guess this new improvised one doesnt work on me anymore... my skin itch and bumps the next day. not sure why. 
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,best sunscreen I‚Äôve ever tried,"This is the best sunscreen I‚Äôve ever used.. my face is combination oily and dry, and I have acne prone skin. This sunscreen blurs my pores, and keeps my skin not oily until the end of day.. best part is it doesn‚Äôt break my skin out.. "
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not water resistant!!,So irritated. I sweat a lot and need a water and sweat resistant mineral face sunscreen and this WAS it. Now that they reformulated it‚Äôs not water and sweat resistant. Now on the hunt to find a new sunscreen.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Protects well, stays matte, blurs skin - love!","Literally obsessed. For the longest time I hadn‚Äôt been wearing SPF on my face (I know!) but every time I tried a sunscreen it became so oily and was such an unpleasant experience. My sister recommended this to me, raving about how matte it is and how it can be used as a sort of BB  cream even, since it‚Äôs slightly tinted and doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast, and simply blurs the skin. She was so right, it does all of those things. Pricey but I can‚Äôt imagine using any other product now, it‚Äôs so soft and smooth. Does at times pill a bit when first putting it on but just pat it out a bit and it‚Äôs fine, still very much worth it.

Oh and it definitely protects against the sun!! I wore to the beach several days, other areas of my body got burned or tanned but my face was untouched (whereas usually it would also have become red!)"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,supergoop superstar,I love the texture. Not oily at all and spreads really well. The only issue is that it is a little too light for my dark skin. This is my third tube so still happy with it. 
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,"bad texture, leaves a white cast and pills ","for such an expensive sunscreen, i expected more. firstly, it comes out in chunky bits. secondly, it pills like crazy. and thirdly, it leaves a white cast on medium/deep skin tones. the white cast does fade a bit after time but it is still visible. the supergoop unseen sunscreen is better imo. will not be repurchasing. "
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Surprisingly Well Done!,"Initially the first uses I had difficulty with this sunscreen, if you use this under makeup you have to make sure you don‚Äôt pair it with any water based creams beforehand, I would prep with water based serums and put this on top and it would pill and was so annoying, but I love the blurring affect this gives is great! And definitely provides some evening throughout the skin"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 45ml,"I‚Äôve tried so many sunscreen but i don‚Äôt love any the way i love this one. i was consistently looking for tinted sunscreens that didn‚Äôt drip off my face throughout the day, this was my perfect match. the only real con of it is the fact it doesn‚Äôt come any other skin tones but other than that i love this for my oily skin"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 45ml,"This sunscreen is good, I love how it goes on the skin, it has a minimal blurring effect to even our skin tone. BUT it is so drying. I‚Äôm having to work harder than ever to keep my skin hydrated because if feels like this just sucks all the moisture out. I think I will have to switch products."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,A must-have,Love this product!! Very light to the skin. I have fair skin and the darker shade in the sunscreen still matches to my complexion. I have used mostly all of supergoops‚Äô sunscreen and this is my favorite!
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Best sunscreen I‚Äôve used so far! ,"I don‚Äôt normally leave reviews, but I am so amazed by the quality of this product I need to leave a review to share how good it is! I have combi skin type and it is really difficult to find a sunscreen that doesn‚Äôt make me look oily after a long day, but this sunscreen did it. Not only that, it acts as a matt primer for me as it blurs the imperfections on my face. Although it leaves a slight metallic smell on my face (since it is mineral base) the smell will fade away. Definitely my new favourite! 
"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,game changer!,"i was very skeptical at first. after my first application, almost decided to return it because it feels cakey for the first good minute. but guys im so glad i gave it a chance. the cakey look dissolves very quickly and your face end up looking fresh and matte. i have oily skin and had always hard time finding a good sunscreen, that i can also wear under makeup. never have been this impressed. it is perfect for my brown and oily skin. highly recommend it."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,A must have to skin and makeup routine,Not oily at all like most sunscreens  Recommend this to everyone leaves such a beautiful matte look perfect primer for makeup I have really oily skin and I skin prepped then used this and the charlotte tilbury setting spray and am never looking back best combo ever made my skin last so much longer then usual
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,mattescreen,was recommended by my sister in law so I tried it myself. not bad at all. the matte finish is something I really like. wear this everyday when I fetch my child as the weather can get really scorching hot. keeps my face from being sunburnt!
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Best face sunscreen I‚Äôve ever used,"This sunscreen feels SO silky when I put it on, it‚Äôs amazing! Smooth and NOT greasy at all. I have oily skin and large pores. It‚Äôs a little hard to tell from my pics but Supergoop Mattescreen is very mattifying, and it blurs my pores. The texture is incredible. I could use just this as makeup. Because it‚Äôs a small and pricey bottle, I‚Äôve been applying my cheaper sunscreen around the edges of my face and this one in my T zone where I need it. Worth the money spent though."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Amazing!,Absolutely love this! I have oily skin and this goes well with it! It almost covers my pores and looks great under makeup!
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,dumb asf,I don‚Äôt understand the purpose of this sunscreen. It clogs ur pores and makes ur face looks gressy and super oily. Don‚Äôt recommend at all dont waste ur money
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Matte and no white cast,I never missed applying sunblock. I love the texture which is matte. This is my repeat purchase and always my go to sunblock because I have oily skin. Most sunblock will get oilier or white cast. I love how this product set on my skin. I wish it will have in SPF 50++++ for greater protection since I‚Äôm paying so much for sunblock. 
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,ms,"i heard a lot of good reviews for this sunscreen! I intend to use this on my no-makeup makeup days! Also I received this pretty fast! Can‚Äôt wait to try it hehe 
"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Love this sun screen ,My friend recommended this. Went to Sephora to get the travel size one to see if it's really good. Tried and have been in love with it since then. Sunscreen is not too thick and greasy. Made my skin matte and pores less visible. No white cast. Can be easily removed. 
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 45ml,"I have dry skin, but this sunscreen works wonders for my face. I tried a trial size but ended up getting a full size cause I liked it so much!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Love/Hate this,"I have a lot to say about this sunscreen. I kinda love & hate this lol. I love that I always receive compliments from my friends, and MY GUY FRIENDS LOL, whenever I wear this. They know I don't wear makeup on a daily basis so they always question what I've been doing to my skin. I guess you can say that this sunscreen is like a filter for your skin. It smoothens out the texture of your skin. And since it's tinted, it helps to evens out your skin. 

But I had to remove a star bcs I have a combination-oily skin, my skin will feel tight & dry after a few hours. Sometimes there's dry flakey skin by the end of the day. So it's definitely made for oily skin only. 

Removing another star bcs Sephora keeps increasing the price of this sunscreen. I've been wearing this sunscreen for years so yeah I notice the price keeps changing. For something that you have to wear everyday & keep on reapplying, I hate it."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,LOVE,"Love this mattifying sunscreen for us oily girlies. It‚Äôs slightly tinted so can be thrown on for natural looking coverage. For the price, I wish you‚Äôd get a little bit more but it‚Äôs a staple for me."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,repurchase,second time user but i am quite satisfied with the result.  i can feel the difference that it make and am happy with it. will continue to use and will repurchase.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Ms,"Mad love. Live up to its name. MATTE!! This is my top fav on my list. Will try the glow version some day as it would have that korean make up glow under make up! Superb. No regret buying.
"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Love this product,"I really like this product, but my only issue is it leaves a slight bit of an ashy look on my skin. But overall this product is great! The Matte finish definitely helps control the oil on my face. I would definitely use this as a primer before applying my makeup. I plan on using the Unseen version which I was told won't give me the ashy look on first application. I would highly recommend this product."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Always be my favorite sunscreen,I have tanned skin and i love this mineral sunscreen because this would never make my skin looks ashy. I think the slight tint helps a bit in color correction and makes skin look natural without foundation. This is my 3rd tub and im loving it every single day. 
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Make-up Primer,"I have been using this product for the past 3 years as a Make-up Primer before my make-up.
The formula has since changed from 100% Mineral to < 100% now. And the exact name of this product has changed and the color of the package has also changed from light blue to yellow now."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 45ml,clogged my pores gave me blind pimples a total disgrace
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Philippines,mattescreen,"My only concern is the shade and packaging, the tint is too dark for me, I am NC20, I prefer a lighter shade that can brighten up my skin tone since I don‚Äôt apply any make up, application wise is smooth and easy to blend, complaint on the packaging, I felt like half of the content is air, I had hard time squeezing out the product and it would squirt all over my shirt and it is tinted! "
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,My new essential!,"I was introduced to this magic by my girlfriend and I am so so amazed by the product! I suffered from oily skin whereby within an hour of putting on my make up, my face will shine like nobody‚Äôs business. This primer, with sunscreen, holds my foundation, and my face did not shine till the time I got home! At the same time, my skin does not feel dry, although I do find I need extra effort to remove my makeup. This totally solve my oily skin problem!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Philippines,Love the matte finish,I got a sample a few years back from buying in the app and I could not imagine not having this! It is very light and tinted yet provides that protection on your face. 
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,one of the best,I cant say enough about how much i love this product. Loveeeee it. I dont need foundation after using it. It‚Äôs finely covered up the pores and i just need to top it up with loose powder and walla! 
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 45ml,it‚Äôs so comfortable and lightweight. literally feels like primer
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Let it sink in!,"I found that this product was not matte but its not bad either. I thought at first that it made my skin look bad but then I realized that I needed to let it sink in before proceeding with my makeup. If I did it straight away my base makeup would break up! It‚Äôs super silky on, like a whipped silicone primer texture. It‚Äôs clear (at least it is on my fairer skin) and makes my skin look like it just has moisturizer on once it sinks in."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Amazing!,I've been wearing this every single day since I tried it! I finally found a product I can use as a sunscreen and primer. It works perfectly for minimizing the appearance of pores as well! Highly recommend to give this a try if you have oily skin.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Safe AND super effective,I love this matte sunscreen under my foundation and I didn‚Äôt even need to reapply after being in the sun all day with fair skin. Supergoop is the best plus it‚Äôs nontoxic!
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Highest praises!!,I absolutely LOVE this sunscreen!!!! It is so light and fluffy and makes your skin so soft! I prefer matte versus gloss/glowy so this is perfect for my skin. I also bought the mini just to test and it's lasted FOREVER!!!
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,New HG!,"I have never love a sunscreen as much before this wonderful product existed! It applies smoothly, buttery and finishes off matte. I always struggle to find a perfect sunscreen for my oily, sensitive skin. I always end up with my skincare interfering with the sunscreen and it balls up flakes on my face. This brand doesn't give me any of the issues I'm facing when using skincare before sunscreen. The Unseen sunscreen is also a favourite of mine. This tops it 100%!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Finally!,I have finally found a sunscreen that I can wear on my face that A) doesn't burn B) doesn't dry out my skin C) doesn't pill and flake and D) isn't greasy! I actually look forward to using this in the morning. I apply it after my moisturizer and it goes on really smoothly and the texture reminds me of Dream Matte Mousse from the early 00's which is fun and nostalgic.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,game changer,"I have an oily skin a very oily T zone , I was struggling to find a sunscreen that would keep my skin looking Matt and out of grease along the day, I felt like this was expensive but No believe me this sunscreen definitely worth every dollar I paid , I‚Äôm enjoying using it also blends perfectly with my foundation it gives me the soft Matt finish for my makeup it does work as a primer ‚Ä¶ love it!!!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Smooth, soft and lightweight",love this. super soft and lightweight. not tacky at all.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Must have!,"I bought this product bc a coworker recommended it to me and I really like it. I have been wearing for about 6 months and honestly since I bought it, I have maybe used my foundation about 3-5 times because I use this as my primer/ foundation everyday. It leaves your skin feeling so soft and even. The tint is beautiful and it matches my skin tone very well. It does not leave my skin feeling oily hence the name."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 45ml,"This is the best sunscreen I've ever used. Chemical sunscreens give me a lot of brown spots from the heat, so I have to stick to physical sunscreens, but they often make me break out from leaving a residue even with double cleansing, and also feel thick and heavy with a white cast. I have tried every possible other sunscreen, cheap, expensive, popular, korean, dermatologist recommended, none work the way this one does! Protects, feels lightweight (I don't even feel it after 10 minutes) doesn't make me break out, doesn't leave a horrible white cast, doesn't look like I'm wearing a layer of foundation. I don't wear makeup during the day so I can't speak to how well it works under makeup, but for me it's absolutely perfect. Please don't ever stop making this. The only bummer is it does stain white clothes, but I still wouldn't give it up."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,worth it,"I‚Äôm sure everyone knows by now that these are the holy grail for spf thats also a make up primer! All of them are amazing and if you haven‚Äôt tried them yet, get with it people!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,SILKY and MOUSSEY + sun protection,SILKY and MOUSSEY + sun protection. Love it. Please make this forever. The travel size is great. Only thing is wish the shade were brighter and not so neutral.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,expensive,"A little doesn‚Äôt really go a long way. I reckon you‚Äôd need quite a bit and the tube will finish fast. The texture is really nice and it blends well, although it might feel oily after a while. "
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,My secret weapon!,"I‚Äôm very surprised by this Sunscreen. Let me start by saying this I am an oily gyal with beautiful brown skin. This sunscreen is a secret weapon for me. It does leave a slight cast on your face if you have darker skin, but that is ok. I love the MUFD HD Foundation but it never lasts on me; until NOW. I wear this under my foundation and it helps my make face last all day even through sweating. Protect your skin at all cost. Here is a picture after sweating. Protect yourself and and look good at the same time ."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,BEST SUNSCREEN EVER!,Best sunscreen ever!!!!! This is my go-to for everyday sunscreen. Even my husband uses it. It‚Äôs tinted and leaves the skin looking so natural and it‚Äôs non-greasy No one can yell you have sunscreen. Make sure you use a light moisturizer before using this sunscreen; makes it even better and it won‚Äôt smudge. This us my holy grail!! I hope they never stop making it.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"No white cast, shine or settling into fine lines","Been trying a lot of mineral sunscreens recently since Replenix discontinued my favorite one, and finally found my new favorite. There is no white cast, and the tint blends nicely with my light brown skin (my tone is like Halle Berry). My favorite 2 features - which are missing from all the other mineral sunscreens I tried - are: 1) this is truly matte with no shine, and 2) it gets absorbed properly (after about 5 mins) and is not just sitting on the surface of my skin; this means it does not collect in my fine lines and does not just rub off when I touch my face. I can use a generous layer of it on my face and know I am protected well from the sun without looking like a shiny ghost."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,great!,My boyfriend has oily skin and he loves this sunscreen
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,tss,"We oily girls must keep this a secret. This is a lifesaver! It‚Äôs like benefit pore primer - blurs all powder and smooths the skin AND controls your shine! I can wear any foundation with this as a primer- and it will not slide off my skin! Love it, holy grail for super oily skin! "
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Supergoop,"Mattescreen's sheer tint helps to mask the white cast from a 100% mineral formula and allows it to blend across a broader range of skin tones, however it does not work for all skintones. For an invisible formula on any skintone, try Unseen Sunscreen."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Love it,"Wonderful sunscreen, light and with a nice texture"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Mattescreen ,Ever since I got this I have been using it in my makeup routine. Finally a SPF product that does not make me feel greasy after application especially in this horrible humid weather !! I will surely repurchase this and the other Supergoop unseen sunscreen. 
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not the best with foundation!,"Hello, i have oily skin hence i tried this out as i loved the unsunscreen one! I would wait 5 mins plus to settle my oil free moisturizer, this sunscreen and then my primer and foundation. It sadly moved my foundation. :( not a fan! I prefer their main one!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,works well as primer too!,"I love this stuff, I've been using it for a year, I managed to make one bottle last that long! I love this sunscreen, though sometimes it does pill I found that when I add more sunscreen it doesn't pill.( also, don't press to hard when applying)  I love how it makes my pores look invisible after using, my face gets greasy easily so on really bad days I'll avoid it but it rarely gets that bad. this saves my skin and it's my favorite primer as well for makeup days! it comes out whipped and fluffy and blends in to be invisible. perfection!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Miraclescreen for acne-prone babe in Caribbean,"About me: I am a very fair-skinned 31 year old who has the joy of sensitive, acne-prone skin and nasolabial folds/forehead wrinkles from laughing all the time. I live between the Pacific Northwest in the US and the tropics of Latin America. So not only am I traveling a lot, but I'm also contending with mega UV exposure, full sun, humidity, year-round, during sweaty activities like hiking, running, and surfing. Sunscreen tends to clog my pores and build up, cause rashes, give me deep underground zits that sit in my skin for 1-2 months (which are not common for me), build up in my wrinkles and cause zits there, make my hair horribly greasy, not actually protect me in wind/water, or not playing nicely under/over makeup during casual wear. For a while I just gave up trying to look attractive while also wearing sunscreen which kinda sucks cause it's a daily necessity. That was until Matte Screen.

About why I love this sunscreen: Because I have so many skin concerns that are aggravated by chemical sunscreens, the mineral formula of this is necessary. I even find that my skin is clearer after using it. It's not a wet-greasy formula as much as it's a whipped smooth texture (kind of like silicon primer). The coverage mattifies and smoothes the skin while not looking like you're wearing foundation and caking up with sweat/water. I find that if I apply it every 2 hours when I'm just out and about and every hour if I'm in the sun doing activities (surfing/hiking/swimming) I don't get burnt, or even get color (which is ideal for me). It lasts for 1-2 months w/ regular use

Other sunscreens I have tried and rejected:
‚ÄîNeutrogena Clear Face Liquid Lotion Sunscreen for Acne-Prone Skin, Broad Spectrum SPF 55
‚ÄîShiseido Urban Environment Oil-Free Sunscreen Spf 42
‚ÄîMurad Acne Control Oil and Pore Control Mattifier Broad Spectrum SPF 45 PA++++
‚ÄîCoola Classic Face Sunscreen SPF 50 White Tea
‚ÄîAlba Botanica Facial Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 45
‚ÄîSupergoop Unseen Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Worth a Try!,"I have a love/hate relationship with this sunscreen. It goes on smooth, doesn't leave a white film on my skin and overall kept me matte the whole day. However it did make my skin feel greasy, but I never appeared oily. I definitely will continue to use this sunscreen, it's the best one I've been able to find so far for my oily skin."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"a decent product, not worth the high price tag","this product does the job, but definitely isn‚Äôt my favorite. it leaves a little bit of a white cast, and it isn‚Äôt worth the price in my opinion. still a good product."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 45ml,Love this! It has a silky texture and no sunscreen smell. You just need to add a little bit at a time so it doesn‚Äôt pill.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 45ml,At first I was skeptical because of the price. I use matte screen because I have oily skin. A little goes a long way! Will be repurchasing.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 45ml,"I love this product so much! However, I‚Äôm disappointed that this particular one is only 1.5 oz and the others are 1.7 oz and they even just released a few in jumbo sizes. Why not this one? Doesn‚Äôt make sense to me."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 45ml,"This is my go-to tinted moisturizer with spf. I've been using it for years, and while I've occasionally tried other new products, I keep coming back to it. Depending on the season, I sometimes need to lightly moisturize before applying or I get some dry spots. It's the perfect light coverage for me that lasts all day and keeps a natural matte finish. Be sure you shake it up before applying- it should be a soft, whipped texture."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,mineral matte screen,"Absolutely my fav sunscreen!!! Mattifies and acts as a primer, creating a very good base and helps with the longevity with foundation, while giving sufficient sunscreen protection. 
Always sold out, so I grabbed 2 at one go. 
Highly recommended."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Loved it!,This is just perfect! It doesn‚Äôt cover my freckles and the texture is so soft and smooth. I love it!
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,good but pills a bit,"Have been looking for a good matte sunscreen other than Coola. This one is good, the smell is faint and not overwhelming. Goes on matte and tint suits my fair skin. Only thing is that it pills when you apply it. Also quite pricey. "
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Just ok, packaging sucks","Sunscreen is okay, I like the concept of a primer/SPF but it does feel like a layer on top of my face and I can't imagine the tint is universal for everyone since it doesn't blend in all the way? The packaging is what really gets me - the orifice is super small and there are a ton of air bubbles in the formula so the product spits out a lot, I have to hold it away from me. I'm also near the the end of the tube and need to crumple it to get product out, but there's kind of a significant amount leftover that it's been like this for 2+ weeks now. Honestly, the entire experience was annoying enough that I won't buy it again."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,So natural! Doesn't cover my freckles!,I love it so much! It is perfect!!!  Doesn't cover everything. Very natural.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Eh,"The matte idea is great but when rubbing this into my skin, it would ball up and almost peel off of my skin. Works better on a hand than on a face. Maybe it‚Äôs because of peach fuzz but I just wasn‚Äôt a fan :/"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Awesome,"Totally love this sunscreen, bought the second one. It‚Äôs not oily and very suitable with my skin type. It‚Äôs also matte my face which I like. The downside it‚Äôs always sold out and need to wait long time for new stock come. "
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Combo Sunscreen/Foundation/Primer,"Love this sunscreen.  This replaces my foundation on casual days.  It is very matte, great coverage, works almost like a primer as well.  I wear sunscreen year-round, and with moisturizer, primer, sunscreen, foundation, etc. it is a lot of layers.  With this, it cuts it way back, and seems to do the trick.
I had avoided this brand, as I assumed it was connected with Gwynyth Paltrow, but it's not."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Excellent mineral sunscreen,"I love this sunscreen so much! I put this on top of my morning moisturizer and bam, it‚Äôs silky smooth matte perfection. My skin doesn‚Äôt feel irritated or dry whatsoever and it feels like barely anything is there. Absolutely no white cast on my skin (though I have fair skin, so I am not sure how it is for people of different skin tones). This is a dreamy facial sunscreen from a brand I‚Äôve long been a fan of. My one and only gripe, and the reason it‚Äôs not a five star product is that you pay quite a hefty price for this product. Considering how much sunscreen is needed to protect the face and neck area, I feel like it‚Äôs a luxury to use this product, when it is something I use everyday. I would hope they could increase the size of this product because I‚Äôd love to see a larger size available, but the price point feels prohibitive."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,favorite spf product,"Have been using for 3 years now and it‚Äôs the only thing I will use.  As a minimal makeup person, it has a great natural look that blurs the skin really well and blends into so many complexions nicely.  The mineral formula doesn‚Äôt feel greasy and controls shine throughout the day.  Holy grail for me."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,good!!!,"This is really really matte! Was skeptical of sunscreen being matte but this really acts like a primer. Even though there is still a strong sunscreen smell, i would repurchase because i love how lightweight and matte it is! As if i didnt apply anything "
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,This is it!,I'm combo skin (oily in my t-zone) and this gives me a great matte finish all day. It's an immediate blur that is great under foundation or with concealer. A little goes a long way and make sure you take the time to rub it in completely and set for a few seconds. Highly recommend.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 45ml,I use this everyday as a smoothing and oil controlling base. Works well under foundation or on its own. I find it‚Äôs evening enough to put blush and bronzer on over it
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,take time to rub and blend into skin!,"I really love this sunscreen! It‚Äôs matte but not drying and feels great on the skin and I love the texture it leaves‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs very silk like BUT YOU HAVE TO KEEP RUBBING IT IN. This isn‚Äôt something that you rub on your face for 5 seconds and it‚Äôs fine‚Ä¶ no. You have to rub it in for about 30- 45 seconds and after you will see how it blends and sinks so well on your skin otherwise it will just sit in your skin and it seems like it‚Äôs pilling when it‚Äôs not. Yes it may take longer than you‚Äôre probably used to but it‚Äôs the only sunscreen that doesn‚Äôt make me oily, greasy, or smelling like sunscreen. Also this doesn‚Äôt irritate my skin either because it‚Äôs a mineral sunscreen and It sits so well under makeup. I have medium/tan skin and it looks great on my skin tone."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,IT DOESN‚ÄôT PILL!,"It does not pill! Initially when it goes on the skin it looks like it‚Äôs pilling, but it‚Äôs not. You just have to continue rubbing it in. I tested this on freshly washed skin with no other skincare products then put my Kosas foundation and concealer on and it was perfect. I have very oily, acne prone skin and this kept my makeup on all day, through a workout and nap. Give it a go and if you hate it, return it- But great for oily skin!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,The Best,"This is my all time favourite sunscreen and I have tried dozens from different brands. It has a slight tint that helps to prevent a white cast and it does not sting your eyes. Also, it doesn't leave your skin greasy like many sunscreens do. "
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,the best.,One of the best products ever made! I have been using this for about two years now and I use EVERYDAY! It‚Äôs amazing by itself and UNDER makeup (confused on someone saying they used it over makeup and hated it). I burn very very easily and this does a great job at protecting my skin! I also have dry skin and sensitive skin and have no issues with it affecting my texture or pores.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"PILLS, no further explanation needed","This is the second supergoop sunscreen that I‚Äôve tried and been disappointed with. This sunscreen does not play well with other products. If you try to layer this over anything it will pill all over your face. I love how it looks when I wear it alone but that‚Äôs not realistic. There are so many other sunscreens that don‚Äôt have this problem, it‚Äôs just not worth it."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 45ml,"Me fascina este producto, es matte y muy buena textura. Lo recomiendo!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Great Sunscreen for Oily and sensitive Skin,"I have been using this sunscreen for 2 years now, great for oily skin. Keeps my face matte throughout the day only need a couple of tissue to keep my face oil free throughout the day. Even with oil i do not get any shine. However when i paired it with some of my moisturizers it can peel/ clump up during application. If you use a moisturize that does not contain silicon this sunscreen will work wonders! 

I have gone through so many brands of sunscreen and i always go back to this! IT has a mattifying effect and slight tint that goes well for my medium skin tone! "
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Change back the formula!!,I used to LOVE this product and it was my go to! But they changed the formula and I have noticed my skin is breaking out more and it has a horrible smell when you rub it in! I will be returning and need to buy something new! :(
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Love this!,"I love this product.  I use this on those days where I'm not putting on foundation but I want a little bit of coverage and definitely sun protection.  It starts out looking a little orange, but I'm about as pale as you can get, and surprisingly it blends in and looks pretty natural, even on my ghostly pale skin.  It keeps my skin matte and I feel it looks really great for a minimal makeup look.  I don't think I'd ever wear this as a primer under makeup, but I also don't feel like I need to wear makeup over it as it blurs well.  This is pretty much the only thing I wear for vacations now and I love that this is all I have to take for complexion products!  Definitely a fav I'll continue to buy."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Just no,"Felt weird on the skin, dries out my oily skin in a bad way, and moves around so much on the skin"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"ironically, not for oily skin","Really wanted to love this. I DO think it‚Äôs a great, incredibly smooth sunscreen with a bit of tint. But under makeup? Just don‚Äôt. This was literally the only thing I did differently in my normal makeup routine, and it made my completely separate and cake in my T-zone. Would probably be fine for someone that doesn‚Äôt become oily with makeup on throughout the day. Normally I use Lanc√¥me foundation, Dermablend translucent setting powder and Mac Prep + Fix spray and I get a bit shiny lateen on but it stays smooth looking. I‚Äôll still probably keep this just for the sunscreen, but I‚Äôm sad I won‚Äôt be able to use this as a primer as it claims it is."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++ - 45ml,"I have acne-prone skin and this product did not break me out at all! My first purchase I was a complete fan and I loved how smooth it went on to my skin and it lasted me a good while! My second purchase didn‚Äôt go as well, I felt like it was harder to apply evenly (even when I shook the tube before applying) and it also got this really weird smell that wasn‚Äôt there the first time. I also went through the tube a lot faster as getting a good amount of product was difficult. Not sure if it was the batch or there was a slight formula change. But I ended up not enjoying it enough for the price, so I am no longer purchasing. I do recommend though, good for acne-prone/sensitive skin and a great starter for those getting into sunscreen. Could be better on redness coverage but the tint is still there."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Mattescreen SPF 40 PA+++,USA,a primer feeling spf!,This stuff is not heavy- if you‚Äôve ever used benefit porefessional this is exactly that. It‚Äôs mousse like and light. The tint doesn‚Äôt leave a tint- it blends in totally clear on me. Was so sick of heavy sunscreens feeling like tooth paste on my skin. This is one of the most comfortable ones I‚Äôve ever used.

SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,Buy at your own risk,"Extremely bad experience after i bought the 162ml version. The cream turned watery & patchy, sometime if not well-shake there's yellowish (oily) substance. Wrote to both Supergoop - cos im interntional customer so im not well taken care, and Sephora - not extending helps but gives standard replies relating to their 30days policies (it's 162ml, not expiring yet.. how to finish within 30days to judge the quality turned bad). "

It feels amazing and has a dewy sheen without being sticky. I always keep a back up!
SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++ - 71ml,"I really enjoyed this mini, was great to carry in a bag for reapplying and a good way to test this formula. The superscreen from supergoop is my go to face sunscreen. Since this cheaper and offered in more sizes, I wanted to try this for face and body. I wore it a few times on my face and didn't love it for that: it's heavier/greasier than the face-specific supergoop offerings, and made my (dry) skin feel congested after wearing it twice. It also has a cooling sensation from the eucalyptus. But while it may lack the cosmetic elegance of their other spfs, this is still a great offering. As a body spf, this feels moisturizing, rubs in quickly, and offers solid protection. Since it's offered through FSA/HSA, we've already repurchased a larger size."

SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Meh,"too greasy and sticky for my oily, acne-prone skin. Will use up the bottle on my body, but even then it‚Äôs still so uncomfortable on the skin. Will not repurchase."

SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Everyone needs.,"I've used this for my face for over 5 years every single day; 365 days a year. Most sunscreens get into/burn my eyes. This will not. I have experimented with plenty of other brands and the only other close competitor is colorescience. But with how much you get for the price here, this is a better choice to make financially! Wonderful and even though it is not sold as a primer, I would use it as one back when I used to wear makeup beforenthe c.virus days."

My skin feels hydrated and great. It has become my daily use sun screen.
SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Holy grail for my dry skin living in a dry climate,"Staple product. So hydrating, so gentle. It‚Äôs my holy grain sunscreen for my dry skin in a dry, Colorado climate. 

In some seasons it does replace my daytime moisturizer. In general, J don‚Äôt tend to like mineral SPFs because they can be too dry, matte, or pill-y on my skin. But it‚Äôs important for me to use it in direct sun exposure because of my melasma. I‚Äôve found that layering Play under my mineral actually helps! Sure, that‚Äôs probably unnecessary. But it does work for me ‚Äî even if I only do this on my forehead."
SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Malaysia,New Favourite,"I purchased the largest size available and will continue to do so! This has the most perfect glossy finish on top of moisturiser, leaves zero white cast and protects skin from pollution all day. "
SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,Perfect size,I like supegoop sunscreen but they do have white cast. anyhow I needed a small size sunscreen to move around.  This one is just too perfect for me. and price range is also good
SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Malaysia,Correct way of usage. Value for money!,"At first it was great, then a month or so after opened, I noticed the formula of the product became wayyy too oily. 

But worry not, I figured out the correct way and to keep the product not oily. Simply just shake your bottle/tube each time before usage. And always warm up the product on your palm rather than straight away apply it on the face or body.

It gives glowy & dewy look. Great for base too.

Best value for money product and definitely will repeat! 

Thanks me later ;)"

SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Good but hate the packaging,10/10 triggering to me that this bottle doesn‚Äôt lock for travel. Every time I go somewhere it squirts all over everything and it‚Äôs annoying and a waste of the product that I actually enjoy. I have tried a million times to lock and it just keeps popping back up
SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,no white patches,"Easy to apply and not feel tacky at all I don‚Äôt even need to apply my powder. Think of buy the big size cause I use it twice a day. Scentless and no watery

SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,On my 3rd bottle,"Favorite SPF for every day use. I especially live this u see my makeup for an added dewy look. It‚Äôs lightweight, not greasy BUT can make my eyeliner run if I apply carelessly around my eyes."

SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Truly the best everyday/ all the time sunscreen,"My whole family loves this sunscreen. We all wear it regularly. It spreads very easily and does not leave a cast. I use it every day on my neck. My husband likes it because it spreads easily over his very hairy body. :) My kid likes it, too. We keep it in a jug on the kitchen counter to easily pump and apply on our way out. I keep the small version in my makeup bag, plus small and medium for day trips and plane travel. I have never been loyal to a sunscreen brand/formula until this one!"

SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Malaysia,Supergoop does no wrong!,I bought this as a sunscreen for my body and i love it to bits. It can also be used on the face so it is super beach-friendly for reapplication and overall body sunscreen. Does not leave my skin feeling sticky especially in humid climates and does not have that weird sunscreen smell.
SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,poor packaging (18oz),"The product itself is amazing, super absorbent and no white cast. However, the packaging for the large bottle is really bad and in order to seal it for travel I wasted a lot of this sunscreen, which isnt cheap. If you plan to bring the large bottle on vacation, I recommend only doing so if you have minimal travel/stops involved. Otherwise, much of the product will be wasted just trying to close it"
SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Malaysia,Ms,I cannot recommend this enough. I used to NEVER use sunscreen because of the oily feeling or whitecast. This godsend changed that. I put on sunscreen every. single. day.

"
SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Malaysia,Decent Sunscreen but oily,"Honestly I bought this as a more affordable option for a mineral face sunscreen. I love this brand and have tried most of their sunscreens, this one is great on body but of course a little oily on the face. The longer I have the product, the stickier I find it gets over time. If you won't be using it up within a couple months, maybe consider a smaller size. "
SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,No breakouts,Love this sunscreen! Most brands make me break out but this one is a dream. Smells great and goes on easily. I even use it on my face which is acne prone and does cause any issues
SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,Decent product ,"Been using it a month now. All I can say is it works best just by itself without the use of other products like makeup or serum or creams.

SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Philippines,Very oily,"I bought this trying to convince myself that it won‚Äôt be as oily as what other people‚Äôs reviews said.

SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Love this stuff,"I love this sunscreen, it feels light and moisturizing and not super gloppy or hard to rub in. Most importantly, it works. I feel like you never know if you‚Äôre sunscreen is truly keeping you protected but as my photo shows, today I went to the beach, I applied my sunscreen once before heading out. I reached the top of my back and my shoulders and everywhere else I needed it but couldn‚Äôt quite reach my back/didn‚Äôt use it there. You can see a clear delineation where the supergoop sunscreen reached lol. Whoops! But glad to see the product works."

SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,Really good but hard to know if it broke me out,"So I actually really loved my experience applying this sunscreen because it‚Äôs not easy to find one in Asia that 1. Isn‚Äôt THICK and heavy in our humid climate and 2. doesn‚Äôt leave a whitish cast on brown skin. As a bonus, this also doesn‚Äôt have an unpleasant scent. 

However, I really couldn‚Äôt be sure whether this broke my skin out, or if it was something else like what I ate or use of surgical face masks (back when we were still new to doing so). So I got scared and stopped using it but sold this to my friend who LOVES it. So I think it‚Äôs a rly good product but if you can just try in a smaller quantity first! "
SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Malaysia,not for me,I dislike the finish texture that it leaves on my skin. My skin looks oily however there is no white cast which is good. This product is supposedly safe to use on kids with eczema. 
SUPERGOOP!-PLAY Everyday Lotion With Sunflower Extract Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,holy grail finally!,"I am obsessed with the play sunscreen‚Ä¶ every other sunscreen I‚Äôve ever tried broke me out on my face except this one!! It‚Äôs so nice, I can just skip my moisturizer and apply this and I‚Äôm good to go! I have dry skin and this is extremely hydrating. It does tend to look a bit greasy but I set it with Laura Mercier translucent powder for like a flawless face. It also works great as a makeup primer. I initially had tried the unseen sunscreen but that pilled with every makeup product. I‚Äôm on my second tube of play and it has never caused any issues. My daily go to routine for college is the rare beauty liquid blush + bronzer on top of the sunscreen and setting powder! (Sometimes also a liner/lipstick/mascara) It looks lovely without any foundation/concealer."

SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,ITS THE BEST!! ,I high key love this one because it‚Äôs very very easy to reapply when u using makeup!!! tbh the packaging itself very compact and easy to bring around! 
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Malaysia,EXPENSIVE,It is convenient to reapply sunscreen over makeup but gives that overly matte powdery effect. Not sure how effective but would prefer to get the medium one for my brown skin. And it is overpriced in my opinion.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Great product if you don‚Äôt wanna ruin your makeup!,"I don‚Äôt like the packaging on this at all, but the product is great! Perfect if you take sunscreen application seriously like me but don‚Äôt want to ruin your makeup by applying lotion."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Malaysia,LOVE LOVE LOVE,Been using this few months already. easy to reapply when have the makeup on. the brush is soft. look small but it lasting quite long. definitely will purchase again 
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Malaysia,For quick fix above make up,Useful for application above make up. I don‚Äôt like the smell. But better than the trouble of applying SPF lotion above make up. Need to rub (swipe?) the brush to get the powder out.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Malaysia,ok,"I can't really tell if powder was going on my face, I dropped this a few times I'm quite clumsy and the brush came out of the body it seemed like they superglued it together, it's quite flimsy "
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Not for Sensitive Skin,I wanted to like this product but ended up returning it :( looked a bit cakey and irritated my sensitive skin. Really cool concept though and love the little brush packaging. Big fan of other products by the brand.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Protects & no breakouts,My fav mineral spf powder! Easy to use packaging & it doesn‚Äôt cause breakouts.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Malaysia,easy retouching,"A bit on the pricey side, but a decent powder sunscreen that one can use to top up your SPF while re-setting your makeup/blotting away grease on the skin. Takes a while to get used to the dispensing system but otherwise not bad. Would get again during sale time"

(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++ - Translucent,"I really like the idea of this. But the packaging does not work  properly‚Ä¶ big headache.

SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Malaysia,NOT SO GOOD ,The finishing not very smooth and I think it not suitable for my dry skin. Easy to apply but the powder goes everywhere so better to use cream spf. Thank you 
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Love it!,"This powder sets your makeup, fixes any unwanted shine, and adds sun protection to your makeup routine! I absolutely love it, especially as someone whose face is almost always shiny. It helps so much with that and I love not having to worry about putting lots of sunscreen on my face with this and the spf in my foundation already on there. This is definitely worth a try! I have the medium shade. There is also a light and dark shade as well as a translucent powder option. The powder comes through the brush, so it‚Äôs very convenient and is great for traveling. The only thing that is a bit annoying is you have to remember to open and close it, but it‚Äôs just a tiny extra step you have to take. I love this product!"

SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Two Defective Applicators,"Bought this twice thinking I was using it wrong.  Followed the YouTube videos and discovered I opened applicator correctly, put it on open and no powder came out.  While powder might be great the applicator stinks.  In fact I never even got enough powder out to try it.   I went back to my tried and true ColorScience."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Philippines,Convenient,Great product for reapplying powder on the go! 
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Fair skin friendly,"I have very fair skin (like, the lightest shade in Fenty complexion products) and this translucent powder does not darken my skin tint. Works excellent with very thick and oily sunscreens like Supergoop Everyday Play and can be reapplied while still looking natural."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,convenient ,Bought this during a sale and it has been very easy to bring around as I have wanted to start reapplying sunblock without messing my makeup. Works well and no spillage so far carrying it around in my bag 
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,"Great on, but not great application","While I think this product is a good idea, I don't think it was executed well. Once it's on your face, it looks nice and has nice coverage, but the issue I have with it is the application. When applying it on your face, the powder gets EVERYWHERE. It makes a big cloud of powder around you making it difficult to apply quickly and discreetly. It also has a sunscreen scent (yes I know it has sunscreen in it, but I don't feel like their face primer/ sunscreen has a strong scent like this.) It is nice that it has the brush included, but I think I would like it better if the brush and powder were separate so that I could control the amount of powder that comes out."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Malaysia,easy,Easy to use. Can just put in my mini handbag. Nice packaging. Soft brush. All good and perfect. Matte. Didnt transfer. I like it so much. Thank you. Love it
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,YASSSS,"Tbh such a great sunscreen, I love it, I love sunscreen"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,great for oily skin but packaging needs help,"I love this product. I have very oily skin so being able to powder over make-up with smearing and without extra shine is fantastic. If you aren‚Äôt oily, this might be too drying or matte for you. My only negative comment is the packaging which could be way more functional. Also hard to squish the brush back into the cap."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Philippines,super handy!,"i always carry small bags so I really like how this can fit in all my bags. a few strokes on my t-zone after a long day, i look fresh again! this will forever be part of my make-up items. "
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,This works as loose powder to set makeup!,I bought this with the intention to use this as loose powder to set makeup and it works well. I pick translucent shade.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,"Great powder, not so great dispenser.",I like this powder‚Äôs finish a lot.  It is hard to determine how much is being applied due to the nature of the dispenser.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,nice,"The powder mechanism makes this a fuss-free, easy to apply and use product. Not tested is the SPF efficiency works as said but it has a nice, matte finish! Love it!"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++ - Translucent,"I love reapplying sunscreen with this! It doesn't move your makeup and since im more on the oily side it reduces my shine, it's also very easy and convenient.  I think that on some people it could look powdery. It's also a bit hard to know how much to put on to get the fully benefits of SPF protection."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++ - Translucent,Works great for a mid day touch up. Also btw you have to remove the yellow plastic thing.(i have seen some people who haven‚Äôt taken it out. Or go to social media to see how to use it.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Not a good product,I had to return the product   Could not get the powder out if the tube and I filled the instructions. And there is so much plastic for one little bit of powder.  I love the sunscreen by supergoop so I was looking forward to this   Big FAil.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++ - Translucent,"Not a lot of color options if you have a darker complexion. I‚Äôm fair-medium depending on the time of year and the medium is almost too light for me. Product is great if you have good skin to begin with and want some extra spf. I do this powder over my foundation for the spf in the summer. I also sometimes use this setting powder over tinted moisturizer for a no make up look. If you have acne, I could see this being cakey or creating dry patches on the skin."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,Touch up on the go,"This product is quite handy to keep in your purse for a little sun protection top up on-the-go, especially in sunny Singapore. But it definitely does not provide enough sun protection to use as your main form of sunscreen. It also isn't the best setting powder on the market so I wouldn't recommend purchasing that for that purpose. "
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++ - Translucent,"This is a great product, formula wise. I‚Äôve been using it for a few years now. It is very mattifying, which I‚Äôm not a fan of, but still looks pretty good. Joining in the shade on the packaging. It is absolutely terrible. It is inefficient, wasteful and unhygienic."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Trash,"I used to work in skincare development and we always absconded with these plastic 2-in-1 dispenser bottle brushes because they never work properly - 10 years on and nothing has changed. I could not get sufficient product to dispense into the brush; no matter how much I shook or tapped the container, all I would get is a thin streak that would blow off before I could even get it to my face. At one point I emptied as much powder from the bottle brush as I could into the cap of another jar and applied THAT powder (similar to how you apply Laura Mercier translucent powder), and this was about 4 hours after I had already applied sunscreen lotion and makeup, but the powder is so awfully chalky, even on my fair skin it separated after about 20 minutes in the sun and did nothing to prevent sunburn on my nose where I had applied it liberally. Trash product, will return."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,OK powder if you‚Äôre wearing makeup,"Do not try and unscrew the powder portion for if you do even the slightest, it will get all messy and the powder will slowly start to spill out. During the time I did use it, yes I felt a powder on my face but was unsure about the sunscreen. The powder didn‚Äôt do its job for I found myself resetting it a lot. Overall, if you like a sunscreen powder, then this is for you. I just recommend to not wear a lot of makeup if you choose to use it."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Philippines,Brush could be softer‚Ä¶ ,"Considering that this has such little product for its price, I wish the brush could have at least been softer. A bit too harsh on the skin and I have very sensitive skin so I‚Äôm a bit scared to use it again.. "
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Mattifying but can be cakey,"The color match is a little light on my medium-tan skin. It also turns out that you need a heck of a lot to get the stated SPF, but for a touch up in a pinch, it‚Äôs ok."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Philippines,ok for retouching,I prefer to use this product as a retouching powder for sunscreen and as a setting powder as it is mattifying. My only issue on this is it lets too much powder out in one swipe. 
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++ - Translucent,I love it so much I do not like the feel of sunscreen but I love this!!
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Perfect‚Ä¶ if you aren‚Äôt piling on product.,"I didn‚Äôt like this at first but then I realized I was layering too many products in the summer for my super oily skin. I was applying toner, moisturizer, the Unseen Sunscreen, and primer. This works perfect for cooler months. When I was still getting oily shine this summer my first instinct was to add this powder to further mattify and touch up during the day. That was a bad call because it didn‚Äôt wear well during the summer day, but neither did my other products. I took a step back and tried my routine with just toner and the Unseen Sunscreen for a week and loved the results but still wanted a little but more shine reduction. I recently added the powder and am loving the combo. Bottom line, by the time I was adding the powder my face was overloaded. It looked great at first but product would break down midday and retouching only made it worse because then it looked cakey. Now, I finally figured out the best summer skincare for my skin type. Toner, Unseen Sunscreen, and this powder are perfect. This product is great as long as you don‚Äôt pile too many products on your skin."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Packaging issue,"It doesn‚Äôt make me look cake-y but I don‚Äôt know how effective this is as a sunscreen. There‚Äôs also a packaging issue where it‚Äôd sometimes leak from the bottom or when I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs open and when I tap onto my hand, there‚Äôs a cloud of powder. Oof"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,Convenient ,"Wanted to try the powder as I love Supergoop sunscreen and serum.  the powder is good, convenient to bring out and powder come out easily from the packing too. "
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,not good on its own ,"This product provides little to no sun protection on its own, but I do like using it as a mattifying powder over my actual sunscreen. I am not a huge fan of the packaging. The product is annoying to shake out, but it‚Äôs not too bad. "
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Blends seamlessly into my cream sunscreen!,"I really love this product! I tend to have issues with sunscreens feeling greasy on my face and making me look oily and shiny, but this spf fixed that issue. While I originally bought it to be my main sunscreen, I found it layers beautifully with the cream sunscreen I already had, which provides me with more security because I know It will actually protect me from the sun. The formula is very soft and it easily eliminates any shininess left behind by my cream sunscreen. It makes my face look great and I don‚Äôt find myself having sensory issues with my sunscreen anymore. I pair this with the hero brand sunscreen if anyone was wondering. Definitely try this out I totally recommend it"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Awful dispenser,"Love the powder, HATE the applicator. I will not buy this again unless it is available in a compact or container of loose powder.  But the product itself works and looks great. Please please please make this available in another form."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,LOVE,"Held my makeup up from the afternoon of pictures to all throughout prom night filled with dancing.

SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,supergoop,Easy to use. Like the products very much. I buy it again when it finished. Hope it have refilled. If not just throws away after the power finishes. It will be wasted.

(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++ - Translucent,"I never got to even see if this product worked because I couldn‚Äôt get any out of the packaging.

SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,I like this,"I'm going to be traveling and needed a mess-free way to re-up my sunscreen.  This is my answer.  The powder dispenses freely; the case is refillable, and it tucks nicely into my bag."

SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Be sure to reapply,Good for oily skin. Really not much coverage like I was hoping but does the job in terms of sun protection. (always looking for the powder foundation that isn't a foundation) it can get whiped off easily so be sure to carry with you.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++ - Translucent,Dropped it once and it snapped right where the powder meets the dispenser
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,"easy to apply, tough to gauge coverage","I tried this and the resetting spray and found this was very easy to apply during the day and over makeup. However I am not entirely sure how much product you would need to use to actually get the SPF 35. For this reason I plan to still use this but as a ¬´¬†refresh¬†¬ª throughout the day, rather than as my main form of daily spf. Pros if this product as compared to other ¬´¬†brush on¬†¬ª spfs: this one has much better packaging. Clear on/off for powder disbursement and there is an interior ¬´¬†tube¬†¬ª that protects the brush bristles from being fan√¢tes when taking the outer tube (lid) on and off. 

As compared with the spray, his was easier to apply. I think I need to try the full-size spray before making a definitive rec btwn the two, as the spray nozzle on the travel size I got was faulty. (I think the package was a dud as opposed to the product not being good!)"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++ - Translucent,Love this power. I always have it in my purse to reapply spf and to add some powder. Always a repurchase
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,love it!,Really nice powder. Controls shine and leaves your skin a nice texture without over drying it. I read some reviews of some people having problems with the dispenser but mine works really well and it‚Äôs a great product to keep in your purse to reapply throughout the day. Great every day spf!
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Not for me,I LOVE all things Supergoop! except for this product. The powder is difficult to get out and the brush does not distribute the product evenly. It doesn't offer the coverage of other setting powders I use (Thrive).
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,My new favorite loose powder!,"This is my new holy grail loose powder!!! I can‚Äôt review it as a sunscreen because I always use it over a liquid sunscreen or SPF foundation, but I am in love with this powder. It‚Äôs so light and so fine - doesn‚Äôt look cakey at all and sets my whole face of makeup without sinking into my fine lines or sitting on top of my foundation/concealer. I‚Äôve tried SO many powders - Laura Mercier, Wander, every Bare Minerals, Charlotte Tilbury, Cover FX - vainly searching for something that would set under my eyes without enhancing the texture of my skin, and this is finally it. It also doesn‚Äôt get oily after multiple hours of wear like the Bare Minerals original does. I have combination skin and this truly gives my skin a natural airbrushed look in the best way. I also love that it‚Äôs self contained so I can throw it in my bag and reapply if/when needed. 

I have combination skin and wear this over liquid foundation (It CC+), cream blush and bronzer (Milk), and concealer (Fenty Pro Filt‚Äôr for highlight and Lancome Teint Idole for coverage)."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Doesn‚Äôt work. Powder doesn‚Äôt come out of brush.,"This sounds like a great idea.  The handle has clear instructions for open and close to get powder out.  Only, the powder doesn‚Äôt cone out.  I shook and shook it.  So, can‚Äôt use it on the go which is why I bought it.  I can open up powder container and put it in tray but I can‚Äôt use brush.  The center powder dispenser (that doesn‚Äôt work) is the same length as bristles, so it scratches my face when I use the brush.  Such a poorly designed item."

I bought this thinking it would be my new go to when on the run or flying. I reapplied as the instructions said, making sure to blot before applying so that my pores wouldn't get clogged. The way the product is distributed could be better but it's a good product for when you're on the run. But unfortunately, this product made my skin break out like I have never before."

At the end of the day when I removed my makeup I had some redness/sun burn on my face. Note: I did reapply every few hours."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Difficult to apply but nice idea,Great idea but I don't know if it's working. I had a different time getting any of the product out and when I did I couldn't control where it went. Maybe if I had it over my foundation it would have been okay but using a spf foundation with this is unnecessary.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,It‚Äôs okay,The packaging is annoying and the powder felt it went everywhere but my face. I don‚Äôt think it would work alone. It‚Äôs definitely more for reapplying sunscreen. I use it after using my native sunscreen to mattify the sunscreen look. The way it releases product isn‚Äôt consistent so I have to work hard to get enough on my face.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,very convenient and not drying,I have had no problems with this product on top of any of my foundations/ tints! I needed something to be able to reapply on top of makeup and was a bit scared of a powder because I have very dry skin but this works great and does not dry me out whatsoever! I think the packaging is super convenient for carrying and applying. I will definitely be looking at more supergoop products for my base!
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++ - Translucent,"This powder is great if you have very oily skin or wear makeup and want to reapply SPF without getting that greasy slick feeling. The packaging is not the best and it‚Äôs overly complicated for no reason which is why I took a star off, but other than that it works great for my skin, no weird cast or powdery look on my darkskin"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,good,"WOW I really love this, has replaced all my Korean gel touch up sun stick because a powder is so much more convenient and elegant to use! Slightly expensive but so so worth it"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++ - Translucent,I bought this to have a sunscreen touch-up option that i can easily carry around in my purse and apply without getting greasy hands. This powder option fit the bill. The packaging is compact and the product applies easily. It is translucent and doesn't cover up whatever makeup i already have on. I like that I can click the container open and closed so product doesn't leak into the lid when not in use. i don't like that you have to sort f mush the bristles together to get them back in the lid so as not to crush them (which is why I removed a star).
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Too heavy,"This obviously works great for some people, but it didn't work for me: I love the idea and had no problems with the dispenser, but the powder just sat on top of my makeup. I wouldn't say it was cakey, exactly, but visible. I've worked hard, with different moisturizers and primers, to keep my foundation at a natural-looking matte finish, and this looked powdery and unnatural up close (it looked okay from maybe four feet away, which is why I gave it two stars). 

Supergoop clearly needs to keep working on their resetting/reapplication SPF products. The resetting spray works better for me than the powder (at least half the time, it works perfectly; the rest of the time, it has an equivalent problem, causing my makeup to shift a little and settle weirdly into my pores), but neither is what I want it to be."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Ok for one application,"I have super oily skin and I don't wear makeup. I usually use an SPF moisturizer but I wanted this to be able to reapply SPF later in the day and not make my skin more oily. Getting the powder to come out wasn't a problem. The problem was that the first time I used it, I tried to use the brush to blend it in and smooth it out like you would with a translucent setting powder. All that did was pill like crazy. Not my favorite. So the next time I tried just dabbing the powder all over my face and waited for it to naturally absorb and mix in with my already oily skin. That seemed to work fine. It created a matte layer that looked smooth and I went about my day. However, a few hours later when I tried to apply the powder again (I'd like to at least try to get in the habit of re-applying every two hours if I can) it just broke up the first layer of powder and created a patchy, pilling mess.  So truly I can only get one good SPF reapplication out of this product. Which is better than nothing, that's why the 3 stars but ultimately I wanted something that I could use throughout the day and this just isn't it. I don't think I will end up repurchasing as a result."

SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,yes product for me! ,"Well, you have heard how mineral powders tend to dry out your skin? Well in this case , it‚Äôs exactly what you want! I use it on my t-zone on the night out as it‚Äôs compact and doesn‚Äôt need a mirror to apply. Just lightly dust over your tzone and you look as fresh as you left home! "
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,hmmmm‚Ä¶,"I would actually give it 3.5 stars if I could. I like the idea of this, but not the applicator, and the ‚Äúdark‚Äù needs to be a little bit darker. All in all I‚Äôll use it up, I‚Äôm just not sure if I‚Äôll repurchase.  And even though I said I‚Äôd recommend it,  I‚Äôm honestly not sure if I‚Äôd recommend it to someone else my skin tone or deeper."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Room for improvement,"LOVE that this is a mineral powder sunscreen that's easy to use on the go and portable. However, the bristles are rough, the product doesn't dispense evenly, if at all, and looks and feels a bit heavy on the skin. Convenient for SPF reapp, but not the easiest or most comfortable to use."

(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++ - Translucent,"Saved my face for a week in Hawaii! I don't like oily/ dewy look in general because I have oily t-zones, so this powder was really nice for touching up my sunscreen and those oily area. At the same time, it's also not too cakey either, so my tan skin will have a little glow to it."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Application Method!,"I like this mineral powder sunscreen a lot because it must barely takes the shine away and doesn‚Äôt make me look dry at all. I don‚Äôt particularly like the packaging so I prefer to take off the part holding the powder, dump a small amount into my hand (or whatever you prefer) and then use the brush to dip into the powder and apply to my face. Also- this alone is not enough for sufficient sun protection! It‚Äôs perfect if used over a traditional sunscreen and also for reapplication throughout the day."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,weird but okay,"Got this because i thought that it will be a good idea to retouch up on the go. However, i feel like the dispenser of the powder is not very good and even? The powder just ends up at one spot and not even sure if im applying it evenly onto my face. Bristles are super soft thought but Wont repurchase it again!!! "

SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,I love it but however‚Ä¶.,"I am in love with how convenient and easy to use this product is. It helps re-applying sunscreen so much easier but however, I wished Sephora sold their refills because having to keep buying the whole thing may be a waste and definitely will not be sustainable. I will get the refill from Supergoop‚Äôs website. Also I would get the translucent powder instead of the pigmented ones. It‚Äôs just a personal preferences I dun really like to see it stained on my mask. But it does help touch up too when I‚Äôm oily at my T-zone which is such a win for me! I usually blot my oils first and then apply this powder to help with mattifying my face and reapply sunscreen. Remember everyone to reapply sunscreen every 2 hrs!"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Should have known,"I should have listened to reviews, the application of this is weird. You don‚Äôt really know where the powder is going, and I fear patchy sunburns. Didn‚Äôt make my makeup look cakey, but I returned because I wouldn‚Äôt know how to be consistent with it."

SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Convenient and Good,"Really nice and convenient way to reapply your spf, especially over makeup. Doesn‚Äôt feel heavy or look bad on the skin.

SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting 100% Mineral Powder Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 35 PA+++,USA,"Good product, so so packaging","Its actually not bad. I like it, it gives a nice matte finish, as well as spf coverage. Only complaints is the terrible application process and the container. Its not that easy to get the product out onto the bristles and on your face. Sometimes I‚Äôm not even sure if its working. And other times i just see dust in the air. But once on your face, it just blends in without altering the color of your makeup. Takes down the shine if that is what youre looking for. Its also really easy to carry around for reapplication out and about. Ive suffed it inside cute 3D purses and its been ok. Its a good product that needs more improved packaging (but at the same time the concept OF the packaging is perfect). Hope that makes sense and helps!"
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Philippines,Dewy Fenty Face for Me,"I was very excited for this product when I first bought it! I said, this will be my new staple moisturizer. It has SPF and all that jazz so yeah, it serves its purpose. But now that I've been using it, I dunno. It's not that bad but it's not that great either, at least for me. I have oily-to-combination skin. This product does make me look a bit more glazed than I need to be. But given the color, this is pinkish, I dunno, it kinda gives me that glowy-finish. So that's why I'm a bit torn. It smells really good though and I guess it does its purpose. But it is indeed just give more of the oily-look than just a natural glow I thought it'd be. I still like and use it though and I may replenish my stock when I consume my 1st bottle and all. Let's see. "

FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Malaysia,it‚Äôs complicated,"I love how the texture feels so good on my skin. But i have a combination skin. My skin gets oily if i use it the same amount of my regular sunscreen. Dropped it pretty lightly, but it gets broken and the tube leak. So be careful not to drop it. Seems like i have to purchase it the whole thing again instead of just the refill. Since the body/case isn‚Äôt working well anymore, the filling part will slide out and no more grip from it body/case part. This is so sad. Hope they‚Äôll improve on this. "

As a person with oily-combination skin, I‚Äôm always on the lookout for a light yet hydrating moisturiser. This product was appealing to me because it is also a sunscreen.

Ended up selling this product since you can‚Äôt return products in Singapore."
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Malaysia,Ms,"It's really good and hydrating but it does not go well under makeup, it makes my makeup look cakey.

I only wished it was a tad higher at SPF 50 but this will do. Spreads easily and no white cast at all, the fragrance does smells luxurious and I would def recommend to purchase and myself to buy again"

FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Philippines,Love this,I have been using Fenty skin for some months now and I really love how it hydrates my skin. Extra plus for having SPF as I spend a lot of time outdoors and live in a hot tropical environment

FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Malaysia,It's alright,"This moisturizer is heavy. I like that it combines with sunscreen so i get to skip a step. But the application on my skin leaves my skin with a high shine and leaves me with a really oily feeling. Had to wash it off after an hour. Tried using varying amounts, still the same result. I am a big fan of scents and though most dislike strong scents on the face-i find it pleasant so that's another positive. "
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,good spf,Love that this contains spf so its a bonus point for me! Very nice on the skin and its moisturising for me throughout the day. Usually use it as my skincare before makeup!

FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,Good sample ,Bought this for a friend so he can try it out - he recently got into taking care of his skin and consulted me for good products to use.

FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,Easy & convenient,"It‚Äôs so easy to apply - just twist and pump! Since it‚Äôs both a moisturizer + sunscreen, it saves me a product so I don‚Äôt have to buy those two separately. It applies nicely and absorbs in well and gives my face a nice glow before leaving the house. Usually sunscreen is oily on me throughout the day and can break me out but this doesn‚Äôt. Rihanna knows what she‚Äôs doing. Keep up the work work work work work work ~. "

FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,Multi-tasker.,"I love that this has moisturiser and SPF. For someone who should be more diligent about using SPF, this is a lifesaver. There is no sticky residue from the SPF and it does have a moisturising effect. I feel like the SPF does work because I feel a difference when I have it on in the sun. Love it. Try it and I genuinely hope it works for you!"
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,strong scent,good moisturiser but has a very overwhelming perfume type of smell. may not be suitable for those with sensitive skin or sensitive to heavily perfumed scents
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Malaysia,Favourite,A bonus 2 in 1 moisturizer. The smell is not overwhelming. The texture is smooth and very light to skin. Nice to wear under make up. Would recommend this. 
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,the best,"Hands down the best moisturiser i have ever used. Its so practical as it is a sunscreen moisturiser so u do not have to use a separate sunscreen. It absorbs very quickly and gives a healthy glowy look. And it smells divine but doesnt break me out. I have used so many botles of it and will keep repurchasing it. So worth it.

FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,Sunscreen Moisturizer,It has a slight cherry / sweet candy scent when applied.

FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Malaysia,second time buying this,"i love this sunscreen moisturiser. i apply this before my make up, it is sticky enough to hold my make up longer. there is slightly fragrance in the moisturiser, but i do not mind it. i have sensitive skin and so far no problem with the fragrance. "
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,Love it! ,"I'm a little obsessed with sunscreen and this one stole my heart instantly. It's moisturizing, thick enough to absorb fast (not sticky!) and smells really good."
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,awesome sunscreen moisturiser,"This is my second purchase of the sunscreen moisturiser and it cuts my skincare routine as I do not need to put an additional moisturiser before putting on sunscreen. It is also hydrating and gives adequate sunscreen protection. Also love how it‚Äôs easy to replace the refill. Just wish that I could really squeeze out all the product out of the bottle. As it is a pump bottle, can‚Äôt really squeeze the tube and leave no product unused.. but overall a satisfying product. "
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Malaysia,The only sunscreen that's suitable for my sensitive skin ,"The first time I wore sunscreen was when I was 15 (2014), and it was a horrible experience. It irritated my skin so badly, and it made my skin burn (my skin became darker). Then I stopped using sunscreen for a while, until my friends suggested some. I gave them a try but they weren't any better than the previous one. I stopped using sunscreen since then. But when Fenty came out with a skincare line, I was wondering if my skin was not as sensitive as before or not. But I waited almost a year since their first launch for other people's feedbacks and specialists' reviews. While I was 'waiting' to try it out, I bought this one sunscreen from a dermatologist-recommended skin care brand (it only has SPF 15 - from my readings, higher amount of SPF tends to irritate sensitive skin more). But it was just the same as the other sunscreens I've tried. So I gave up in finding the right one for me, including Fenty's. But reading the comments on their instagram changed my mind, I wanted to give it a try. If it's good, I'd continue to use it.. else, I'd stop and just give up and won't be using any sunscreens for the rest of my life. And I'm so glad I gave it a chance ‚ù§Ô∏è It's not only a good sunscreen for me, but it also plays well under makeup. I can apply Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte foundation (which dries down fast) easier and better ‚ù§Ô∏è"
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,Dewy finish but strong smell,"Leaves a dewy finish and has a nice feel, also doesn‚Äôt pile under makeup but it has a really strong chemical smell that doesn‚Äôt go away so will be purchasing a different face suncream when it runs out! "

FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,SAVED MY SKIN,i have never ever ever used any spf all my life. gave this a try because im a hugeee fan of riri's products as it alllll works on my skin. i cant even describe how this saved my skin. my skin if more hydrated now and most importantly i know its protected! will have to purchase the refill soon!!!
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Malaysia,BOMB.COM,"Truly truly i tell you, MS RIRI did not come to play, this is a combo sunscreen and moisturiser together that does not leave your face cakey or sticky after applying, it does it‚Äôs job of both, moistures your skin throughout the day and protects your skin from the sun. I cannot emphasis enough on how this product change my life, please, do yourself a favor and try!!"
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Malaysia,SMELLS LIKE HEAVEN,"This product wins. Love the smell of it, i would literally wash my face just to use it. Also love that its a sunscreen, not sticky if used the right amount. MY FACE SMELLS LIKE FLOWERS!!!"
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Malaysia,Strong smell,"I like the packaging and I like how it‚Äôs a moisturizer as well as a sunscreen which is very convenient. 

Butttt the smell is really strong. It‚Äôs a nice smell (at least to me) but when you apply the product on your face, it feels like you put a perfume on your face :/ might not be repurchasing because of this."
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,Hydra Vizor Sunscreen,"Tried as there was a hyped for it, but didn‚Äôt like the product because it has an oily texture after application. Won‚Äôt be buying it again. Haven‚Äôt even use up 3/4 of it."
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Malaysia,not for oily skin,After applying too oily for me..won‚Äôt purchase again..the texture is too sticky although no white spot appear..not recommended not recommended not recommended 
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,sunscreen moisturiser ,Was in love with the idea that it‚Äôs a combination of sunscreen x moisturiser but 2 stars because it‚Äôs not the best for oily skin :( You can give it a try if you have really dry skin though 
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Malaysia,good two in one moiturizer ,the packaging is nice and more practical. this moiturizer+ sunscreen really save my time whenever im in rush go out. its not sticky or leave white cast on skin. overall im happy to use it
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,Fenty Sunscreen,Women who can't live without a sunscreen protector... give it a try once it launched.. It is sooo fragrance and easily absorbed. But I gave 4.5 stars because I prefer bottle with cap than twisted type..
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,love!,"Love how this is 2 in 1 & save me time! Smells good & doesn‚Äôt make my face oily or so.. it can get alil sticky but if you apply an appropriate amount on your face, then the stickiness won‚Äôt be too overwhelming:)
"
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,Feels luxurious - probably a better moisturiser than sunscreen?,"It really does what it says - it's lightweight and glides on and absorbs seamlessly into the skin, and it smells great (almost like passionfruit?). I feel like it even helps to even out my uneven skin texture with a blurring effect - just a little bit. All in all I feel good wearing this.  

I like that niacinamide (vitamin B3 which has many health benefits) is one of the top few ingredients. It also has hyaluronic acid (sodium hyaluronate). 

I can't confirm or deny the sunscreen function of it as I naturally don't burn easily. I assume it works. 

However, if you have very sensitive skin, you may want to stay away from this moisturiser  as it does have fragrance. However, it's one of the last few ingredients, so the concentration of it is probably quite low. 

I love that it's refillable, making this overall an economical option as it's both moisturiser and sunscreen, and many good 50ml sunscreens/moisturisers are already around 40 SGD each or more. However, I may not be reordering as I would like to find a dedicated mineral sunscreen with zinc oxide instead of non-FDA approved chemicals like AVOBENZONE, HOMOSALATE, OCTISALATE. "
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Philippines,love this sunscreen,"Apart from the pretty packaging, I‚Äôm a fan of this sunscreen‚Äôs fruity scent. This product feels hydrating on the skin and has a dewy finish. It‚Äôs quite pricey to repurchase but good thing Fenty Skin promotes sustainability. I just need to buy a refill once I run out of this spf."
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,wanted to love it but..,"What I love
‚Ä¢ 2-in-1 moisturizer and SPF (good for the lazy days)
‚Ä¢ no white cast
‚Ä¢ nice sensorial experience, lightweight texture, nice scent, easy to apply
What I don‚Äôt love
‚Ä¢ leaves me looking too greasy for my liking (I have combination skin) not sure if I used too much product but SPF has to be applied in adequate amount for full protection ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I‚Äôll still continue to use it only when I‚Äôm staying home and don‚Äôt mind looking greasy (cuz u still need SPF protection even indoor!) good for lazy days when you don‚Äôt wish to apply so many layers‚Ä¶"

FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Philippines,Great moisturizer with sunscreen,This is a great moisturizer that has a bonus of spf! It does not leave a white cast and it blends well underneath make-up. Spf could def be higher but good enough as an addition to your moisturizer. I just use a separate spf 
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,AWESOME,"My face is super super drying, struggle to find a moisturizer that rlly helps w my skin problem. Sometimes it can be tooooo oily yknw! Plus it has 30 SPF. A win win! "
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Malaysia,mrs,My skin feels glowing right after apply this sunscreen. But the glowing effect doesn‚Äôt last long enough.

FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Malaysia,NO REGRET,"Love it! It gave my face the kind of glow I needed. Plus it‚Äôs both sunscreen & moisturizer, worth the price. However, the fragrance is quite strong. Will purchase again. "

FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,not for everyone,"This moisturizer has a nice texture and is not oily. suitable for oily/combination skin.

FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Malaysia,smell and feel good,"Packaging is sleek and sustainable. It is definitely moisturising and the non-comedogenic ingredients helped in healthy skin while protecting it from UV.

FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,FS Sunscreen Moisturizer,"love the recyclable packaging, it‚Äôs well thought. has a little fragrance to it but goes off after a while. I used this as my morning moisturizer. not sticky, doesnt leave a white cast and no sticky feeling. it does make the skin looks radiant. 
"
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,Convenient ,"The packaging is honestly really cool and the moisturiser is lightweight and doesn‚Äôt feel oily and heavy on my oily skin. The extra SPF means I don‚Äôt have to use another sunscreen on top which is great because I‚Äôm trying to keep my skincare routine to a minimum (excessive use just breaks me out). Makeup doesn‚Äôt pill with this too. Love it!
"
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Malaysia,Good,It is not oily. Suitable for oily skin.  SPF might not be high but it is more of a tinted moisturizer. Advisable to add another later of sunblock if you are gonna head out or be in the sun for some time.
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer,Singapore,best best best,Not trying to be bias but by far best sunscreen i ever used.

I‚Äôm super lazy in the mornings and this product lets me skip a step and saves precious time.

SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Supergoop Glowscreen 20ml,"Since¬†I have sensitive skin, most sunscreens I've tried have failed me. It usually stings my face and causes itching. Not until I tried the Supergoop glowscreen and fell head over heels in love with it!

I noticed how well Supergoop's Glow Screen absorbed into my skin and created an instant glow the first time I used it. I don't normally use primers, so having that hydrated, dewy base to build on was like seeing the world through new eyes.

This product, on the other hand, is not water resistant and is best suited for daily use at home or in the office."
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,absolutely love!,Nothing but great things to say about this sunscreen. I‚Äôve used a few tubes of the smaller size and finally purchased the bigger tube. I recommend this sunscreen to everyone! 
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,the best,Pretty and I really like the color. Love this stuff so much! Since I have sensitive skin. I'm an esthetician and have never used a brush like this but decided to try it out. 
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,The Best Sunscreen !,"I love supergoop, and have purchased more then 3 times for this product. I love it.

SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,glowy ,"it does make my skin a bit oily through out the day since I have oily skin..but it does not look greasy mess, just a Little more glowy than usual..ahaha.."
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Philippines,my absolute favorite sunscreen!!!,I LOVE this sunscreen so much. Definitely worth the price. It gives such a subtle and natural glow. The best part is it doesn‚Äôt even feel like I have sunscreen on. I use it as a base for daily make up. 
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Love hate,I have a love hate relationship of this product. This doesn‚Äôt work for me during the summer bc I look super oily and my blush and contour starts to melt away. But during winter it works so well for me since I‚Äôm drier
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Pilled like crazy, and I looked like a disco ball","Pros: 
- leaves a beautiful, radiant finish underneath makeup 
Cons:
- I could not get this sunscreen to stop pilling! I tried different moisturizers, no moisturizer, rubbing it in right away, letting it sit - nothing worked! It would end up streaky and then when I tried to rub it in to even it out, it would pill!
- on bare skin, I looked like I had rubbed highlighter all over my face, not like I had a ""glow from within"" look."
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Please expand the shade range.,"I do like this sunscreen. It is suuuuper glowy/luminous, but if you like luminous primers it‚Äôs great under makeup. I love the finish because it‚Äôs not greasy but not too matte. All I ask is to please expand the shade range. The current shades suit people with medium skin tones. Those of us woth skin tones on either end of the spectrum, pale or deep, don‚Äôt match. Please more shades!"
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,great ,Run don‚Äôt walk. Very lightweight and Non sticky. Gives a luminous finish and perfect for the glass skin look! Would definitely repurchase! Xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Use as a highlight,Try it as a highlighter if you struggle with how it wears on your entire face. I was about to ditch it but decided to try it just as highlighter and I absolutely love it! The added bonus of spf will keep me using it this way.
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Perfect!,"It gives you glow, not gray film, doesnt leave white residues. Texture is fine too, great absorption, just a healthy glow on top of its protection! Love it! "

SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,sunscreen ,Probably the best sunscreen I have used. This takes time to dissolve into your skin.. gotta be mindful of that but totally helps. Even works like a basic concealer.. fades off abit and does get a little patchy when in sun‚Ä¶ so be mindful of that
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,love the glow. hate the price ,i wish there's an alternative to this because i love it but its so expensive. the glow is just beautiful!!! and at the same time im protected from the sun!

SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"No, this wasn‚Äôt it.","I‚Äôve used Supergoop! In the past, but this product is just not it. I have dry skin, but this made my skin look like I slathered my face in grease. Didn‚Äôt absorb and highlighted every imperfection. Not my favorite at all."
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++ - 20ml,This is not a good product for mature or textured skin. It sits in fine lines and exaggerates texture like I‚Äôve never seen. The shimmer is so overpowering!!! Looks like a rubbed gold metallic shine all over me!
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Break out galore!!!,You guys! This broke me out like never before and I had to wait for two months for the breakouts to clear. I used it once. I was not hormonal and I did not use anything else that was new. I‚Äôm not even sensitive.

SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not my Favorite,Very disappointing after watching all the YouTube influencers. I found this to be VERY glowy and I looked like Data from Star Trek. Ended up throwing this away. Not my favorite.
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Too much pill,I liked the look but for me it pills and it pills a lot. If not for pilling I would have liked it a lot bc I like the dewey look.
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Amazing,Such a good formula cleared my skin and made it smoother I will always repurchase this
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Most important AM product,"Love love love this. It makes my skin glow all day, making my skin appear youthful while also protecting me from the sun. This has replaced CC cream I used to use because it feels much more weightless on my skin, which is important to me"
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Poorly constructed package design.,"The worst part is the package. The sunscreen leaks out is the tube into the cap. You can‚Äôt get it out to use the excess, wasted product without a very thin toothpick or pin. It is also very greasy on the akin."
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Great for under makeup,"I loved the product when I first bought it. I have been using it every day for the past 6 months and its finally starting to feel empty. I have noticed that I love this product so much more on days when I am wearing makeup. On the days that I don't, my skin feels sticky. The product feels greasy in your hand, but once on the face, it does not. Nowadays I don't wear makeup, so I will likely not repurchase this product. I am looking forward to trying the UNSEEN SPF from this brand. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good SPF that will give them a glow under there makeup!"
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Bottle leaks,"This stuff is GORGEOUS & I love it, but the bottle leaks like crazy after owning it for a while. Just a heads up."
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Philippines,Too goldy,It left my aking looking greasy deapite me having dry skin. It can work as a subtle highlighter because it looks kinda dewy-glossy when applied on hugh pointa of the face.

SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++ - 20ml,"I don‚Äôt HATE this, but I don‚Äôt love it either. It gives a pretty glow and the spf quantity is great but it feels greasy on my skin (dry/combo) and tends to pill up after an hour of wear.  Will probably not repurchase but it‚Äôs not a bad product at all."

Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++ - 50ml,"When using the daily recommended amount, it goes on super patchy and is almost impossible to make look good.

SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++ - 50ml,This is way too glowy. I have dark skin and between normal and dry and it looked horrible. Oily and glowy at the same time. Probably my least favorite supergoop product
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,It‚Äôs just okay,"It‚Äôs a good sunscreen don‚Äôt get me wrong. Pros of this product are the high spf, and the glow. Cons of this product is that it broke out my neck. It does peel after I applied moisturizer and I let my moisturizer soak in completely."
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,glowing sunscreen,"Ok nice glow but best application is to run between fingers and tap on face rather than rub into the skin. At first I tot it gave me breakout but thankfully it didn't. Alittle goes a long way.

SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Super Glowy,Super glowy product. I looked like Data from Star Trek. Will not buy again.
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Tin Man,"It‚Äôs very thick & patchy. The glow is super metallic and not at all natural. It will emphasize every pore you have. I tried it by itself and as a base for makeup. It does not make for a good primer since it bjdjjsjs






bunches"
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Finally! Golden Hour,"I have been waiting for this shade forever! Finally, glowscreen is available for us medium and dark skin girls. It gives you the perfect glow for no makeup days and can even act like a glow-y primer"
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Ms,Love the light sheen. Was worried the tint might interfere with my make up as I am tanned but it melts into skin and blends well. No white overcast and feels very comfortable. Also no break outs. Excellent purchase!
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Gives a nice glow, feels nice on and SPF!",I finally gave a supergroup product a try and really loved this one! I have worn it all summer when I'll be outside. It is like a tinted moisturizer with SPF. I have also had people say I'm glowing!
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,worst ever ,You don't even need to scrub or put on anything on your face to creat residues. They will appear and fall off themselves. 
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++ - 20ml,Best sunscreen for glowing skin . Love the shine and texture on my skin . Highly recommend it
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++ - 20ml,I love this sunscreen it‚Äôs super easy to apply and it leaves my skin super glowy it‚Äôs also a great makeup base for me (since i don‚Äôt wear that much) 10/10
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not for Acne Prone Skin,"Looks really pretty on the skin. I have tan skin and this color worked well for me. Add a little concealer and I looked great! However! This broke my skin out SO bad. I have normal to dry skin and I always end up greasy when this is applied. My face started gradually breaking out and at one point I had about 7 pimples at a time from this. They were big, red and painful. They didn‚Äôt clear up until I stopped using this. Such a shame! If you don‚Äôt have acne sensitive skin, you‚Äôll enjoy this."
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Disappointed!,"I literally never leave a negative review on a product but for this one I couldn‚Äôt hold myself back. I‚Äôve been using this product for about 4 months now. I have super dry skin and moisturize prior to using this. I haven‚Äôt seen anyone else complain about this but this product leaves my skin extremely flakey, and if i glide my finger across my face, the entire product peels off. It doesn‚Äôt blend well at all. It also makes me look so greasy, not glowy. I genuinely don‚Äôt like it at all. Again, I am not sure if this has anything to do with my having very dry skin, but considering I moisturize in advance, I am very confused. Will not purchase this again. I do like their unseen sunscreen though. Its just this particular product that didn‚Äôt work for me at all."
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Best of all worlds,"This is basically a tinted moisturizer, but it‚Äôs still a great product! It makes my skin look nearly flawless, yet is so sheer that you can‚Äôt even tell that I have any product on my face. It also doesn‚Äôt show up on clothes should you accidentally touch your clothing to your face which is really surprising!It does make my face a tad bit darker than my natural complexion, but it‚Äôs not to the point that it makes me look orange. I‚Äôd honestly prefer a shade lighter (hence my 4 out of 5 star rating), but it‚Äôs not a major complaint of mine since it just makes my face look sunkissed compared to the rest of my body. It‚Äôs not greasy either like other sunscreens, and it protects against blue-light!"
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++ - 20ml,"I liked it originally, and what it was supposed to do, but I found it pulled quite a bit and it also gave me an orange tint that I did not like. Won‚Äôt be buying this again."
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++ - 50ml,Love love love makes my skin look airbrushed while protecting it. Great for that Dewey look. I have totally stopped using any foundation because of this. Only thing is it does not have zinc
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,nice!,"pretty, a little greasy, but overall a nice product and love that it is tinted and glowy and is a clean product here!"
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not for super fair skin,"If you are on the extreme light side of the spectrum, beware that this product does have an orange tint and doesn‚Äôt sheer out all the way. Maybe swap for the clear version also from goop."
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Philippines,good,"Does not cause any irritation on my sensitive/dry/skin.

Got this less 25% off on sephora‚Äôs sale. Great value for money. Will definitely re-purchase. "
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,There‚Äôs better out there,Mid. Leaves foundation colored flakes on your skin .Matte or stick version is way better.
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++ - 50ml,This sunscreen looked amazing on my face but it broke me out horribly. It has niancinimide in it which may not be the best for sensitive/acne prone skin. Such a shame. I‚Äôm going to have to return this product.
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Too dark for fair skin,"I usually love supergoop products and this would be great if it just came in a few more colors.  I purchased the lightest tone and it was still extremely dark on my skin.  Even after putting on makeup over my sunscreen, my face still looked darker and more orange than the rest of my body."

SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,WOAH,"as someone who doesn't wear makeup at all, i didn't need this but i just had to try it. I LOVE IT. the tube is small but a little does go a long way even with the two finger method. some say not to put too much or you'll look extra glowy but i think because of my skin tone, it blends in really well. gonna repurchase when i run out "
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,too much,"i have normal/oily, acne prone skin and this is waay too ‚Äòglowy‚Äô for me. the pigments cling to my skin texture, looks super cakey and oily the moment i apply it! doesnt sit well under make up either. now, instead of coating my face with this, i mix 2 drops with my regular sunscreen and that is more than sufficient!"
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,so glowing ,"This sunscreen is very glowing..

SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,decent and glowy,"Use this when i do not want to use foundation. As i cannot layer my foundation on top of this product, it will cake up really badly and appear to be super patchy. But by itself, very nice glow"
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++ - 20ml,Didn't like the feeling on my skin. Too heavy and greasy. It also gave me a very strange shade.

SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++ - 50ml,"I am a dog walker so I am out in the sun a lot and need a daily sunscreen. This dries well on the face, but broke me out. Might work out better for someone else with less sensitive skin."
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Philippines,my favorite glow sunscreen,i use this sunscreen if i want to add glow to my makeup. the consistency is just unbelievable. very lightweight but it does its job. this is my second tube. hoping to get my hands on the larger sizes since i use this every single day and i run out pretty quickly.
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Meh...,"Not a big fan of this. The tint comes out to look oily and whitish, which is why I prefer the unseen sunscreen. Bought this one and have never purchased another since. Really won't recommend this for dark skin tones, which I am. I eventually just used it up by wearing it on days when I wasn't wearing makeup."
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Miss,"My favourite product to use at the moment, had gone viral on tiktok for a reason !!"
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,I use this as bronzer on dry areas of my face instead,"I can‚Äôt seem to love any of supergoop‚Äôs products. They turn me into an oil slick after an hour. I‚Äôve tried  this one, and the ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù one. And this glow screen reminds me of the Dior Backstage Face and Body Glow, wherein it‚Äôs too dark on me, and my skin‚Äôs isn‚Äôt even that fair (more a light-medium); so I ended up using this sunscreen the way I use the Dior one, as a liquid ‚Äúbronzer‚Äù. I‚Äôll stick to my Japanese sunscreens, thank you very much"
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,super oily,"I think because I have oily skin, when I use this it makes my face super super super oily and looks like I sweated through the whole day already, would not recommend if u have oily skin"
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,the prettiest glow,"supergoop never fails to make the best sunscreens to wear under makeup. the glow screen and unseen sunscreen are my go-to's. the glow screen makes for the perfect dewy makeup look. i get so many compliments on my skin when i wear this. you don't look greasy or like a disco ball, just the perfect glowy healthy skin look. i'll recommend a million times over."
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,it‚Äôs ok.,"It‚Äôs good, but not life changing. Did not make me greasy, or breakup my makeup. The shade is too dark for my Fenty 150 skin tone. I would not wear it alone, unless I‚Äôm going for a C-3PO look. But it works well under foundation."
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++ - 50ml,Amazing! Makes my skin look SO glowy and radiant. Looks great on its on and under makeup.
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Great for dry skin friends!,I have dry skin and this gives it a nice glowy look. It makes me actually want to wear sunscreen on my face. I use it in place of a tinted moisturizer.
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,supergoop,"It makes my face look oily and tanned when apply, i think you should apply before makeup. Cannot apply and go out without makeup because it will make you look like you didn‚Äôt bathe yourself. Maybe because this one is mot a toned up one
"
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Philippines,supergoop !! ,"Supergoop glowscreen - a bit dewy on my skin. Bought this on sale, but still expensive since it‚Äôs spf 40 only. I still love supergoop tho, buy i still prefer their unseen sunscreen! "
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not it.,"As a glowy base it‚Äôs fine. 
As a sunscreen it awful. 
I know it says to reapply every 40 minutes - which is insanely impractical for a sunscreen. If you‚Äôre using it for actual sunscreen purposes, as one does with SUNSCREEN, reapply EVERY 35 minutes. This melts off. Don‚Äôt trust it as a sunscreen. Think of it as a glowy base and wear another sunscreen because this one is simply not it"
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Healthy glow ‚ú®,"Love how this blends nicely on my skin, leaving me with a healthy glow ‚ú®‚òÄÔ∏è I apply a small amount on the skin so it‚Äôs not overly glow-y which may come off as oily. "

Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++ - 50ml,i love this sunscreen it makes me look glowy and i receive many many compliments!! i recommend to get the bigger one since the smaller one tends to run out quicker and has way less product.
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Amazing,"Gives skin beautiful glow. Tint is pretty sheer, but still manages to even out your skin tone."
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Great for non acne prone skin,"I bought the miniature size and loved it. Once I purchased the larger size I realized I started breaking out on my forehead with little red bumps after every use (everday) even if I washed it off. I went without it for a week and it started clearing up, but once I used it again it all came back. I don‚Äôt recommend if you have acne prone skin. If you don‚Äôt have acne prone skin it‚Äôs amazing I love glow iness it gives my skin and never pills, just wish it didn‚Äôt make me break out:("
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++ - 50ml,It wasn‚Äôt very good it left a greasy finish instead of glowy  it looked very gooey on my skin and felt very heavy on the skin it also separated my makeup after I put it on top

SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,I'm in love!,"the MOST perfect secret ever!

SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Philippines,Glowscreen,I love this sunscreen! It‚Äôs not too glowy that makes your skin look oily but has that subtle glow which is perfect under your foundation. I also love that it‚Äôs very lightweight and has a high spf! 
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Definitely Recommend,"OMGGG
This is the best sunscreen ever. Usually I use a lot of highlighters in my daily makeup routine but with this I do not have to use a single highlighter. Definitely a great way to save money on highlighters and protect your skin"
SUPERGOOP!-Glowscreen Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Primer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,nice!!!,"Nice But can get a bit more shiny. I used it on its own but does not glide as much, so its better to put a little bit of moisturiser first then this! Its not oily and easilu get absorb by skin. "
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,Supergoop Glow stick Sunscreen ,Not sure if this works like a sunscreen or more of a glow stick product but since the bottle says spf 50 I‚Äôm assuming it works like a sunscreen. Hassle free but can look oily on skin so it‚Äôs good to massage the product in. Very lightweight - good if you don‚Äôt like feeling heavy products on your face. + it dries up on your skin really quick.
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,"Finally, a product that fits my needs.","transparent stick sunscreen that's great when you're on the go. don't have to worry about whitecast or clumping issues. easy to reapply and spread, especially down the neck."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,too much glow?,this product does not have white cast at all which i really like unlike other sunscreen ive tried so far in the market (im a medium neutral undertone) but it does stink my eyes and i would advice consumers to avoid eye area. apply at your own risk. not suitable for SG weather it might make you look greasy even after applying makeup.

SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Worth it,"Between being Wonder Bread white and medication I‚Äôm SUPER prone to burning really easily. I went on vacation and needed a good solid sunscreen so I wouldn‚Äôt have to check my bag. This stuff came through in a big way, I just smeared it on every morning and never once got burned. I forgot to reapply but I was out in the middle of the Caribbean not avoiding the sun at all and this stuff worked amazingly well. Bonus, it‚Äôs Reef Safe so you can take it to all those places where you need to specifically have Reef Safe Sunscreen."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Malaysia,supergoop is supergood ,"i love this sunscreen so much, this is my 2nd time purchased! a bit oily at first but u need to spread it all over your face with your finger so it can be even "

SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Philippines,love the concept! ,I love supergoop for SPF needs! This one‚Äôs a new concept! I love it. Does the job. Best for the beach since it can look too oily. But nonetheless inlove the concept of a stick
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,very convenient,"this is the first time I try this brand, it is so convenient, and it does not feel any oily on your body, for me I think it‚Äôs better than lotions , and this one it‚Äôs transparent , so you can literally put everywhere on your body even on your face!!

SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Great!!!!,Love this!!! Clear.  Easy to apply but can appear/feel slightly greasy. Do love it though!
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Don't mind it,I have sensitive skin and this hasn't caused any breakouts! I like to use this on days where my skin needs some extra hydration or when I want a glowing make look. You should try it if you dry skin or living in a drier environment. I wouldn't recommend buying this if your skin is on the oiler side or if you are living in humid areas.
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,"Disappointed - twist method just broke through the gel, super thick and heavy on the face. Returned - better sunscreen out there."

You can easily carry it in a small purse when you‚Äôre outside and use/re-use it anytime you need to. Please don‚Äôt discontinue this one. It‚Äôs very easy to apply as it just glides on pre-made face. It doesn‚Äôt mess up make up but actually gives a shiny glow to the face.I haven‚Äôt had any skin problems from using it. face"
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,It can feel a little greasy when you first put on but dries down to a natural glow in 10 minutes. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend for oily skin but is great for combo or dry skinned people. Smidges makeup a bit if you reapply on top but not too bad. I don‚Äôt love the way the stick is shaped cuz it makes it hard to reach certain areas of the face like nose and under eyes.
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,I honestly love this sunscreen stick it wears beautifully under makeup it leaves your skin looking super glowy and feeling hydrated and it doesn‚Äôt have that sunscreen smell
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Malaysia,Glass Skin Dreams,This is an incredible ‚Äúmakeup‚Äù product when used as a highlighter on cheekbones and lids due to its glossy and dewy finish. There is very little product on this stick so it‚Äôs definitely meant to be used as a final step on top of regular fuller coverage sunscreen. 
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,This spf stick is gorgeous! Gives you that pretty nice glow. Did not break me out since I have acne prone sensitive skin is a plus! Less than 1 star for it's price point. I will repurchase and recommend it!

SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Way too oily for my skin.  I love the regular sunscreen and bough the stick as a way to re-apply protection on the go. Well it was definitely too oily for my taste-the oily mess just stayed on top of my skin- not a good feeling at all! Specially in 90 degree weather I can feel my pores clogging.
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,"It‚Äôs okay for use to reapply on a no makeup day, but that‚Äôs an it. It also stings my eyes bc its chemical. But under makeup its HORRIBLE. Also it pils a bit. Will not be repurchasing."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,better options out there,"i think it‚Äôs pretty good for the price, but the finish is just so greasy that it‚Äôs hard for me to want to repurchase this"

Medium and dark skinned people ALSO need and deserve this kind of sun protection-Y‚Äôall need to buy it. People with sun spots or Melasma- you need and deserve this too. Don‚Äôt sit there reading this review- buy it!"
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Convenient but kind of oily,"So I tried this product for the first time and honestly it wasn‚Äôt bad the only complaints I have is that if you have like oily skin it wouldn‚Äôt be good because it is an oil based product and it does stay kind of oily and also if you‚Äôre like me and hate the feeling of greasiness on your face this is not it either. I have combination skin where I‚Äôm only oily in my t-zone but it still felt like I had a ton of grease on my face in that area. So to fix the greasiness I felt in that area I used my super goop resetting powder on top of it, (but I don‚Äôt think you should have to buy a whole separate product to enjoy this one).On the parts of my face that were not as oily it worked well like my cheeks, but on my nose and forehead I did not like how this product felt. It is more oily when you first apply and then the oiliness kind of goes away but not fully. I ended up washing it off after having it on for a few minutes, it‚Äôs an OK product so I won‚Äôt return it instead I will just use it on my hands, neck and chest. But I wouldn‚Äôt really recommend it to anybody because there are way better sunscreen sticks out there."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,The perfect Dewy sunscreen.,"I was surprised to like this stick. This stick makes my skin look dewy. It gives the perfect summer look, I like the healthy ingredients, the texture is perfect when contact with water. The reason I would not give a full 5 star review is because it can come oily when wearing sun glasses. But I like that is a travel size product as well."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,Sun stick ,If you want an easy touch up when you‚Äôre outside then this will be useful. It leaves a greasy feeling the whole day unlike the usual sunscreens. It does however give you that glow if that‚Äôs you‚Äôre looking for. This is fragrant free and goes on clear. 
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,oily,"I love superfood sunscreen but I hate this. Feels like oil sitting on my face, I hate it."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,surprisingly not sticky!,Surprisingly not sticky! Dont use this if you will apply heavy makeup because it will make your foundation looks glowy and oily. With light make up should be fine.
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,Tad Oily but Easy to Use,Been using this as my main sunscreen before applying makeup. Would say that it doesn‚Äôt mix into the makeup. What I would do is to apply 1-2 streaks on each part of my face and dab it with my fingers to even out to the rest of the skin. Hopefully this prevents clogging
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Fantastic for beach,"Very convenient for reapplying in the beach!! Trust me you don't want to touch your face when you're in the beach with sand and other germs on your hands. I have dry/normal skin so this worked well, but I wouldn't recommend for those with oily skin. Another thing--this is a DRY OIL and OIL in any format doesn't work well with makeup. If you use it over makeup, make sure you bring a powder to ""set"" everything again."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Really great for re applying during the day. I wear it everyday
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,This glow stick works really well for me. Love the glow it gives. I apply it after moisturizing my face and it works so well for regular going out use.
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Love the glow!!,I add this over my moisturizer on my face and shoulders and I must say the glow up is real. Been using it for about 2 years and it‚Äôs my go-to when I‚Äôm on the go. I feel like a little goes a long way.
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,I ignored the reviews and I wish I hadn‚Äôt,I have used this products for two weeks now. I suffered through the oiliness just bc how convenient it is. I now have a massive cluster of huge pimples under my eye. Do not buy this.
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,nice and easy,"Love that it‚Äôs clear, reef-safe, scent free, convenient to roll on, doesn‚Äôt break me out. I typically wear it without make up and it gives me a nice glow. You can be in the pool and it‚Äôs so easy to reapply. Only reason I rated 4 stars is because it is quite slick on your face once it warms up with your body temperature. Would still repurchase."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,"It‚Äôs very good, feels kind of oily when u first apply it, but that goes away quickly. It does not give you pimples or anything like that, and it leaves no white marks on your face, good product to have."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Great for dry skin,"I have really been enjoying this product for the past month. I appreciate the fact that I can‚Äôt detect any discernible scent from it. I like wearing it by itself and with my primer and makeup. My skin is very dry, and I enjoy how smooth and glowy it makes my face feel. You may find that your makeup doesn‚Äôt stay on as perfectly as it would without it, but I don‚Äôt mind how my makeup wears throughout the day, and I would rather have the SPF protection than not. I also keep a travel size bottle of the SPF setting spray at my desk at work so I can add more sun protection throughout the day while wearing makeup. If it‚Äôs a no-makeup day, I will apply throughout the day, sometimes blotting my face with a tissue to remove older product before applying a new layer. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend putting this product on your eyelids if you sweat a lot‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt feel great when it runs into your eyes. As someone who is trying to incorporate SPF into their everyday skincare routine, I think these are very useful products that streamline the process."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,I find this product to be so oily I can‚Äôt figure out a way to use it.  I will dab a bit on my melasma at the beach but that hardly makes it worth it.  Thumbs down.
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,great but oily,"love the sunscreen, it‚Äôs super easy to apply but it does make my face look very oily for a while after applying."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Very Oily (Beware),"I read/ heard all the hype on this sunscreen, and I unfortunately it did not work for me. It glides on super easy and is convenient. But it made me face so oily and never blended in my skin literally felt like I had baby oil on my face. For reference I have combination skin but near mostly dry. Hopefully this helps someone :))"
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Not for summer,I bought it in the store and I was so excited to use it . I‚Äôm a black girl with normal skin and it makes my face look so greasy . I live in Boston so I plan on using it during the winter months
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,This sunscreen amazed me it is an oil stick and it feels weightless after a moment of wearing! It glides on so easy to and I don‚Äôt have to use much!
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,"Convenient, but always runs into my eyes","I keep this in my bag to apply sunscreen for my bike commute to and from work, but I've stopped using it on my face as it always runs into my eyes. Not sure why as I don't sweat a lot on my bike ride. I do like that it's a light formula and easy to apply."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,"I always felt skeptical about what a bar, I was having a lot of problems with my previous sunscreen my makeup Was cracked it no matter what I did it was not working well on my skin I have oily skin and the shine is irritating sometimes, but from the first time I used it I did my makeup as I normally do and wooh the makeup has improved a lot and it is very good protecting the skin!"
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Malaysia,Ms ,This is very oily. It broke me out so bad. Not suitable for combination acne prone skin. It gives a very oily look. Nothing compared to Shiseido stick spf. 
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,In love with this sunscreen,"This is my first Supergoop product and definitely not my last. Completely clear, doesn‚Äôt feel greasy, couldn‚Äôt be easier to apply. Reef safe too which is a big green flag for me."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,great for no makeup days,"If you want a product that you I‚Äôll reapply sunscreen over makeup, this is NOT it. It will take your makeup right off & move it around & get the stick all gross. Just don‚Äôt bother trying it lol. Now I just use it to reapply on days I‚Äôm only wearing sunscreen, which it works well for. I really love it for reapplying on my neck/chest though because it gives a gorgeous glow to that area, and I find it a little too dewy for my taste on the face (and I have dry skin)."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,It was way too greasy. I broke out after wearing in once
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,I love! (Not for oily skin),"I really like this product. I‚Äôm trying to be a lot better about reapplying sunscreen throughout the day and this one is great! I would like to add that it is greasy/oily. I have very dry flaky skin so its perfect for me and soaks up very quickly. it is an oil based product so keep that in mind. If you have oily skin you will HATE it. 

I use it everywhere and it works great for me. I haven‚Äôt used it over makeup though because I use supergoop‚Äôs resetting spray for reapplication over makeup"
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,"oily, sticky","I was very hopeful about this product as this was my first sunscreen stick. Eventhough the product provides great protection and is easy to use, it is significantly oily and didn‚Äôt work well for my combination skin. If thats not a problem for you, I‚Äôd definitely recommend this product."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,Easy application!,Love that you can apply this without having to manage sticky sunscreen all over your hands! The stick is really easy to use and glides smoothly on!!! Feels nice about a tad oily after application!
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,"Easy to apply but it is too greasy. I have a dry skin and it doesn‚Äôt absorb to my face. It doesn‚Äôt give me a glowy look, it is a greasy look."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Overall pretty nice,I really like this sunscreen! It‚Äôs super convenient and easy to apply due to its stick form. The only thing is that it‚Äôs a little greasy. As someone with very dry skin I don‚Äôt mind and it does absorb in a couple minutes so it leaves more of a glow which I like for my dull skin. I‚Äôll probably buy again but I wish there was more product for the price and less oiliness.
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,I like it!,"The first time i used this was probably 6 months ago, and i broke out in little bumps the next day, however i did use it in combination with a couple other new products so i couldn‚Äôt be sure what did it.. i decided to take a chance and try it again the last couple of days and it‚Äôs been working amazing for me! no breakout so far. It also is the perfect glowy base for under my foundation, which helps my foundation look even more dewy."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,leaves you looking glowly!,"I liked it! I have combination skin around my t zone and don‚Äôt mind the glowy look, but someone with oily skin or doesn‚Äôt like that look may not enjoy this sunscreen. When you reapply it def feels a little greasy at first, but it absorbs in after a few minutes and you can‚Äôt even feel it after that!"
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,My skin broke out. If you have sensitive skin do not use this. Returning it today
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Broke me out :(. My skin was finally almost PERFECT to where I wanted it to be and this product took me back to square one of my skin healing journey. I wish I read the reviews beforehand. It‚Äôs gonna take months to get my skin back to where it was :((
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,It‚Äôs Okay,"Love the shine and the sun protection this product offers. Also love the ease of application. I have very sensitive, cystic acne prone skin and it hasn‚Äôt broken me out! I would say it gives you more of a oily shine rather than a glow from within. For that reason I only use it on my high points of my fave for touch ups and a different product for my whole face. Not necessarily a bad thing if that‚Äôs your vibe. It is quite greasy, and my hair does get stuck on my face after I apply. Overall, I think it‚Äôs fine but I wouldn‚Äôt purchase again."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,best ever,"The best facial sunscreen. I bought it for myself and loved it. My son, who has sensitive skin, tried it one day and now it‚Äôs all he will wear on his face. It‚Äôs the only one I‚Äôve found that doesn‚Äôt irritate or burn his skin. Grateful!"
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Malaysia,my favourite ,This product is my favourite. Although it gives an oily look to your face but I‚Äôm a type of person who likes the glowing effect on the face. I personally think i doesn‚Äôt protect your skin from the sun that much especially if you‚Äôre sunbathing at a beach. 
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,"I was so excited to use this for my sunscreen reapplication. As much as I love the unseen sunscreen, this was a total fail. The stick lifted my whole makeup and smeared all over my face. I could see streaks whenever  the stick touched my skin. My face looked like I used a cleansing balm to remove my makeup when I used this stick. I tried it on without makeup, I looked like a grease ball. Going back to my good oldie shiseido stick spf."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Wanted to love this product but it sadly makes me break out which is rare for my skin type.
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,"Not a fan‚Ä¶ while it didn‚Äôt make me break out, the formula is very greasy and doesn‚Äôt absorb into the skin even after an extended amount of time‚Äîot just kind of sits on top of the face. This makes reapplying throughout the day (the only reason I got this) tricky especially if you are wearing a mask since it just wipes off. The shape of the applicator is also not designed well for the crevices of your face (eg between nose and cheek). It also smears/lifts makeup if applied over makeup, unless you were to maybe dot it on your face vs swipe it (giving you much less coverage). I swear by the glow screen but I‚Äôm not sure what the purpose of this product is."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Not for me,Disappointed with this product because it is too greasy for me. I‚Äôm afraid it will give me acne
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Malaysia,Nice,Suit my skin type. Not becoming too oily after long wearing. Easy to reapply. Small packaging make easy to bring around. Not messy like cream or gel sunscreen.
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,"I was very hopeful, as I use and love the unseen sun screen  however this product is too greasy/oily looking, returned it."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,great for dry skin,My second time getting this product best over makeup sunscreen if you have dry skin
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,To oily for me :/,"The absolute heartbreak of the pimples I'm now getting, I've never really used sunscreen but tried play at disneyland so decided to try a few more supergoop, and just got this order on like the 13th I think Today's the 18th and I have 3 new pimples, pretty sure it's because it's super oily even after I  . I'm gonna go ahead and return and try the matte.


---* I didn't see it literally says oil stick on it loll so could have been my fault but sheesh 3 !!!!"
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,love it!!!,glides amazingly over makeup and is soooo convenient! absolutely love and will buy again!
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Malaysia,Favourite sunscreen,"I love this product so much. I used this as an everyday sunscreen. I love it as it gives a glossy finish. Even used this before I apply my makeup, an the finish look is amazing. Easy to store and carry with in my bag too."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,Very shiny,"I know its supposed to glow but it makes me look greasy, shiny and oily when I have dry skin. I really was looking forward to try it but it just made me look like you could cook an egg on my faceüò© "
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,"Convenient to use on the go however, it will leave your face quite oily for awhile. I have drier skin so it does eventually absorb and doesn‚Äôt leave any greasy feeling. I would NOT recommend for oily skin."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,too oily for my liking ,"was quite excited because i finally found a sunscreen stick that i can use for daily reapplication however after using this, my skin immediately started reacting badly. i did a patch test and it was fine. my skin isnt sensitive but this is genuinely too oily, it feels like there is a layer on top of my skin and it is extremely uncomfortable. i like that it was a stick form but it‚Äôs too oily for my liking and my skin started breaking out afterwards. wouldnt recommend to people with oily or combi-oily skin üòÅ"
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,effortless,"The one thing that I love about this product is how effortless it is to apply, you don‚Äôt even need a mirror. The one thing I don‚Äôt like about it is that it leaves a greasy look which I don‚Äôt mind but it it‚Äôs not my favorite look. I personally will not repurchase,but I do recommend this product if you have dry skin"
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,"Too expensive, not enough product",Bought this to have an easy way to protect my tattoos in the sun. I love it and it works... but I've used it sparingly and it's nearly done. Way too expensive for too little product.
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Canada,Perfect for re applying,This stick is my go to for re-applying sunscreen during the day I take it with me everywhere I go. Is super easy to apply and give you a very nice glow
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Love this product! It does run out fast if you use it everyday and leaves an oily look to your face but is absolutely perfect under makeup. This is a great sunscreen and cheap.
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,"Don‚Äôt love. Makes my skin feel greasy, and I have naturally dry skin so that‚Äôs saying a lot. It also runs out very quickly. I‚Äôve only used it a few times and have already had to roll it up so much."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,became super small. corporate greed wins again smh
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Made Me Breakout,"I needed a new SPF, so I wanted to try this product for my dry skin. I was so excited until it made me breakout! This is the worst my skin has looked in awhile. Other than the breakout, it is (of course) oily. The application is easy but a little can go a long way! I do not recommend to my friends with sensitive skin."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,keeping it!,"first, I like that it‚Äôs SPF50. it doesn‚Äôt smell like ‚Äúswimming pool,‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt smell at all! I also like that it‚Äôs a stick because it‚Äôs impossible to waste it compared to those in a tube. I also like that it feels light on the skin and that it‚Äôs not oily."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,Wonderful!,"I mean, its supergoop, of course it‚Äôll be good!! I use this for my daily dose of sunscreen and touch up!!! Super convenient to carry around and really cute packaging!!!"
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,just the right amount of glow,"Indoor heat was ruining my skin and no amount of layers were helping. I dint want to wear face oil during the day due to the sun but then I came across Glow Stick Sunscreen, which looks and feels amazing when you are indoors in the drying heat as it‚Äôs an oil and the SPF makes me feel completely protected."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,On the go,Nice and on the go Sunscreen.. easy to reapply. I bring it everywhere i go just to reapply.. but it really makes me glow.. nice packaging and easy go apply on my kids too
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Beautiful Product,I have acne prone and very dry skin. I wanted to try this out to see if it would help with the dryness. I LOVE this. This oil soaks right up into my skin. It doesn‚Äôt leave me greasy (this may just be because I have dry skin). I like that this is a stick too. It‚Äôs very convenient. I‚Äôm obsessed.
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,horrible scent,"Greasy, thick, smell horrible!! Washed my face after applying and the smell was still strong!! Love goop but this product was disappointing."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,Love this!,"I love how light the product is on your skin and it‚Äôs great that it absorbs quickly and doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast. Definitely would recommend to others!
"
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,It‚Äôs a must!,"This wears so nicely under my makeup! I‚Äôve replaced primer all together by layering this with the glow recipe dew drops, my fine lines are no longer an issue and I can combat any shine issue with setting powder. This has also lasted a little over a year of almost daily wear! ‚ú®"
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Great for kids!,"I‚Äôve been using this sunscreen on my young freckle prone daughters for years and it is the best! It is so easy to apply, makes their beautiful little faces glow so it is easy to tell where it was applied, and requires no rubbing in or blending. A superior option for little ones! It also works well on their shoulders and I use it for a quick swipe on a no make up day for myself, but do find it to be very shiny on my skin. It causes too much slip under make up for me but for my three daughters aged 7, 5 and 5 this is a must have!"
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Malaysia,spf 50,my favourite SPF cream. I'm using it for more than a year. unfortunately it is always  not available during sale. I hope I buy it during sale. it's easy to apply.
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Malaysia,it‚Äôs a NO from me,"Is it a good SPF? Seems like it. It does not sting my eyes, application wise it‚Äôs smooth and easy to use. But these do not mean this is the best sunscreen. I have dry skin. Because sunscreen is meant to sit on the top of your skin, I end up looking like a grease ball. Because for it to be effective, the correct way to use this kind of stick sunscreen based on my readings is to apply it thickly & overlapped on the skin, and later to blend it out. What an oil slick mess. It‚Äôll be great under makeup but on it‚Äôs own on my makeup-free day, to quote Donnie Brasco, ‚Äúforget about it‚Äù."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Good Reef Safe Sunscreen,"I like that this sunscreen is reef and ocean safe. But, I found that when applied it was really wet and sticky and took a little more time to absorb into my skin. After it was absorbed I feel it did it's job well and I didn't get a red in the face as I normally do. It has a bit a sparkle which made me feel like I didn't need to put on any make-up."
SUPERGOOP!-Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,USA,Supergoop! Glow Stick Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Love love this product! Super convenient on the go.
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Singapore,Great product ,Picked it up seeing after raving reviews online. The product is not as shiny or sticky. It is quite light weight. Also great that it is quite natural and fragrance free. Other than that it is a nice product and I am satisfied with my purchase. 
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Singapore,nice texture,"Love the product‚Ä¶. Never like sunscreen due to the oiliness and stickiness‚Ä¶.. But this is not oily and sticky‚Ä¶. Sits well under make up‚Ä¶. Will repurchase..
"
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Philippines,Love it ,"Love this products and will reorder as soon as I finish my stock. I like the consistency, it doesn‚Äôt have a white cast and it does not make my skin dull. "
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Singapore,love it,"I‚Äôve been enjoying this sunscreen so so much, it does not leave me shiny which is what I like. For reference, I have combination dry skin. Definitely gonna be repurchasing once I run out as I‚Äôm alternating this with another great sunscreen - Resist Super Light Daily Wrinkle Defense from Paula‚Äôs Choice!"
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Singapore,Supergoop SPF 50,"I recently went on beach vacation, supergoop was easy to apply and oil free. Non irritating and non comedogenic indeed. It naturally blended in my skin without residue. It protected me from getting sun burn with its spf shield."
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Malaysia,Mrs,"In our country weather, this product is very useful and helpful. The texture is very smooth, light yet you will feel covered... yeayyyy, thats how its work. Highly recommended!"
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Singapore,best sunscreen ,best serum and easy to use.the best thing is it is available in mini size.Will definitely repurchase and value for money. It lasted for a long while though the serum dries out a tad bit sticky on skin. will definitely repurchase and one if the best hyaluronic acid serums in market which is affordable 
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Singapore,non sticky sunscreen,Finally found a Supergoop sunscreen that is really non sticky. Tried unseen and play before. This is the best among them. Play is super sticky after apply and followed by unseen that is slightly sticky after apply but it absorb quite well. 
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Malaysia,good,"very satisfactory, although I am a man, I really like to use sunscreen, but most men's face is quite oily, if I use sunscreen, it increases the oil.  but for this sunscreen I am very satisfied and the important thing is that it is not greasy.  I really like it and it's not wrong to buy it."
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Singapore,not great,"Errrrr, i love the texture of the product, which is watery like what it says and it feels lightweight on the skin, however i don‚Äôt like how it makes my face looks kinda oily after awhile and another minus point is i hate the packaging. It is so difficult to squeeze the product out of it and some more the product that i got apparently had an error on its packaging- the sunscreen leaks out from the side of the shaft rather than the hole where its supposed to come out from. "
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Malaysia,No white cast at all,"Omgg I thought I would hate it but no, I loveeeeeeed it. It does not leave a white cast. Just make sure to blend step-by-step. Overall it is a good product, doesn‚Äôt make my face too shiny even though I have oily skin. Definitely will repurchase!"
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Singapore,loving it so far,"I have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin and this did not break me out. there's no white cast & i used it for a whole week in bali and there's no sun burn! i also use it as a base before my make up & it works nicely."
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Malaysia,the best,pernah guna produk supergoop yang lain-lain sebelum ni..tapi muka sangat-sangat berminyak..tapi yang ni best sangat..muka x jadi berminyak dan cepat je menyerap dalam kulit..terbaik dan confirm akan repaet order lagi
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Malaysia,Not for dry skin ,"This one made my skin itch and broke my skin out. Not very suitable for dry skin as well as it‚Äôs very lightweight. Also, given that it‚Äôs lightweight, it‚Äôs very watery. "
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Malaysia,honestly the best sunscreen ,the best! I have really sensitive skin this didn‚Äôt give me any irritation or bumps! Plus NO white cast! NO sticky or oily feeling after applying and it really works! 100% would recommend! Loveeeeeeee!!! 
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Singapore,supergoop,"supergoop's spf is amazing! the every single face spf lotion isnt too watery that it's messy to deal with, but thin enough so it doesn't feel too heavy on the skin. it gives a nice dewy look after application and dries down to a semi matte finish. only thing is that it's expensive, but will definitely repurchase during sales"
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Singapore,Not suitable for combination to oily skin ,I heard so much about this Supergoop sunscreen so decided to give it a try. I have combination to oily skin and it‚Äôs not suitable for my skin. It looks super oily on my face.

The product feels nourishing to the skin and doesn‚Äôt clog pores. I pair it with a lightweight moisturiser and the skin doesn‚Äôt feel oily.

SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Malaysia,Good,"My daughter uses the sunblock with sunflower extract from Supergoop and it suits her skin well as she is having dry skin-type. For my another daughter, that Supergoop sunblock made her skin greasy like an oily pan. "
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Malaysia,The best sunscreen for my combi skin!,"I've tried so many drugstore sunscreen because I want to save money. But! I wasted so much because after first use its always looks so bad.

This Supergoop sunscreen really deserve the hype! It doesn't leave white cast, feels so lightweight and blends well with my liquid foundation. I wear light make up and I let the sunscreen absorb first before putting in my foundation - as per instructions at the packaging. It also gives my skin the dewy glow which I like very much because I prefer oily looking skin than dry flaky skin any day! this is the best sunscreen I have ever tried because it doesn't feels like I'm wearing sunscreen, it hydrates my skin and doesn't smell weird at all. Worth the price + cute packaging ! I'm very happy with this purchase."
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Malaysia,Wonderful,"The product is amazing! I have been an avid user of the sunflower sunscreen, thought I couldn‚Äôt have been in love with any Supergoop product is an understatement. THIS IS MY NEW FAVOURITE! It does feel like you are not wearing anything at all, since I am not wearing any makeup, I feel like this product is amazing unlike what few of my friends found this product when they were wearing makeup. "
SUPERGOOP!-Every Single Face SPR-Shield watery lotion SPF 50,Malaysia,Good only when not wearing makeup,"Loved this sooo much only when i dont put any makeup on. I have an oily skin n when i wear this before wearing the foundation, it makes my skin really oily n greasy. Maybe its just that i dont set the makeup properly idk. But overall it‚Äôs 4.5/5 for me!"

LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Aqua Gel SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,ok,I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but this sunscreen pills like mad liek there is no tomorrow‚Ä¶ for it‚Äôs price it shouldn‚Äôt? I used it on clean dry face and it still pills‚Ä¶
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Aqua Gel SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,Excellent,Worth the price. Can use daily for up to 3 month. Does not feel sticky on face. Good protection from direct sunlight. Has been used it for years and still at my top choice of sun screen so far 
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Aqua Gel SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,aqua gel sunscreen,"is a good sunscreen and it doesn't feel oily after applying, leaves skin feeling semi matt but still feels refreshing (is a complicated feeling) but anw, it's a little expensive for such a some tube so I'd suggest to go to lancome counter to get some sample and try out before getting the actual size. purchase during sale period is a better option."
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Aqua Gel SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,ms ,Since it‚Äôs very popular so I bought this one to have a try. It‚Äôs smooth to apply and keep moisturised all day and not oily because my skin is mixed oily. So good for feeling.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Malaysia,favourite SPF!,"This is currently my favourite SPF (and i‚Äôve tried a lot)! It‚Äôs lightweight, doesn‚Äôt have a white cast, makes skin looks great, smells nice (watermelony) and makes using it in the morning pleasant"
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,3 almost 4 stars,"Honestly it‚Äôs not as bad as everyone makes it seem to be. Personally, I like this product Bc of the high SPF. I don‚Äôt think the Niacinamide in it has done much for me. This will pill if you put it on immediately after your moisturizer. As long as you leave a gap between the application of the two you should be fine. Also, this does leave a white cast for a bit after the initial application but it does end up going away. I also enjoy the glow it gives me. I would say the big downside to this is if you rub your eyes hours after application and you somehow get some sunscreen in your eyes while doing so, it will burn. I‚Äôm in between a 3 and a 4 but Bc of the burn and not seeing a difference in skin unevenness with the niacinamide, it‚Äôs a 3. However, I will most likely repurchase again purely Bc it‚Äôs an SPF 50 and you don‚Äôt see that often."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Malaysia,lives up to its name,"If you love glowing skin, you will love this. Do not need highlighter or glowy primer with this. Puts on a little heavy and sticky but absorbs after awhile. Subtle watermelon scent. "
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Singapore,leaves a white cast,I wanted to like this. I like most of glow recipe products but this one disappoints me. The packaging is cure but It leaves a white cast. Will not repurchase 
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Malaysia,fav ,"My favourite sunscreen ever !! My skin glows and it looks amazing under make up !!
This and the mosituriser did not peel for me so i love it. My skin is lookin amazaaaaaaaaaaang !"
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,"Pills, period. :/","This was the first GR product I disliked‚Ä¶enough to warrant me bothering with a review. I can only use this on my ‚Äúwork from home‚Äù days because I can‚Äôt put makeup over it as it pills - even if it‚Äôs the only thing I put on my clean skin. Also I can feel a slightly oily film over my skin (compared to my Asian SPF creams/milk). So sadly, I can not recommend this. I gave it an extra star for cute packaging and pleasant scent."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Singapore,Sunscreen,"Please remember to shake before use. It gives me a-little bit of white cast when i don‚Äôt shake it. 
This sunscreen does make my skin look so GLOWY. However I don‚Äôt fancy that super glowy look on me. It‚Äôs just too much~"
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Pilling if used with other products,"This product is great as a stand alone product or with 1 other product, it leaves your face dewy. But as soon as you use 2 other products or more with it, you‚Äôll get pilling or shedding. It also shifts makeup throughout the day."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Singapore,eerrmm... dun reallly like this,"kind of regret buying this. it leaves white casts, feels sticky and my foundation doesn't settle nicely with this sunscreen too. now maybe will just use whenever i go out without makeup. will not purchase this anymore."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Better sunscreens out there,I received a sample of this and it balls up a lot. Makes your skin look gorgeous from the far. Looking like a glow from within but if you touch or face or add makeup on top it will ball up.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Always peeling and breaking up. Not worth it,"Unfortunately had the same effect most people had. Super peeling, even for my girlfriend. Wanted to love it for the Niacinamide and glow effect, but just won‚Äôt happen! :("
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,I should have listened to reviews,"Extremely temperamental with pilling, supergoop is a better alternative. The only way to wear this is by itself and if you get lucky enough to rub it in without it clumping up."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Wanted to love,"I wish I could love this, glow recipe is my favorite skincare brand. But it does not work on top of their other products. when I use a glow recipe serum and moisturizer, let them dry down, and try to use this, it just pulls up and takes off my other products. I also feel like it doesn‚Äôt work as well as a usual spf 50.."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,A miss,"Pills and feels tacky on the skin. Personally found the scent pleasant, but not to put on the face for a full day."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,There are better options out there,"I was so excited for this! I recently got into sunscreen at 33yrs old and have been on the hunt for something glowy and moisturizing for the upcoming Winter season. It was a blind buy, meaning I didn't bother reading reviews or do any sort of research, which was my first mistake. I had slight irritation throughout the day, it most definitely has white cast and from my experience, you CAN NOT use it over other skincare. The first day I used it, I applied a Hyaluronic Acid Serum first like I always do every morning. I let that dry down and then I applied the Glow Recipe. It looked fine to me, but then i had gone to do my brows with my magnifying mirror, and that‚Äôs when I saw all the small piles of pilling scattered on my face. I thought maybe I did something wrong so I looked up reviews and sure enough, it was a common issue. Another review stated to use it on a clean face without anything underneath so that‚Äôs what I did the next day and I had no pilling whatsoever BUT I still had slight irritation throughout the day. Giving it two stars because the glow it gave me was *chef's kiss* but not worth it to me to keep."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Pills,Pills after it dries down. It‚Äôs okay under make up but it lifts much more when makeup isn‚Äôt holding it down.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Only my body can tolerate this,"Only my body can tolerate this. On the second day of use, my face and neck broke out in tiny whiteheads within hours. I gave this sunscreen a break and revisited it later only to have the same issue. It also has enough white cast to not be friendly for most skin tones. Like other reviews, I also 
experienced pilling. Gave it 2 stars because it feels nice on the rest of my body."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Malaysia,very greasy sunscreen,"not recommend if you are living in humid environment like malaysia, make my skin greasy and oily especially after 12pm, i am combination dry skin, will not repurchase again"
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Not worth it at all,"Smells good and is glowey, however it pills very bad!"
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,I Like It,"I like the product a lot. Sometimes I apply it after the dew drops. A few times, I have had a little pilling, but the majority of the time I do not. Definitely planning to repurchase. The picture is from right after I added some."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,I have honestly never written a review on anything I ever bought and this is the first. I truly love this!!!!
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Singapore,2 types of sunscreen,I‚Äôm impressed at the use of both mineral and chemical sunscreen in this formula.After the 1 minute initial application there is no white cast. im excited how it is a sunscreen that also shows results on your face! The niacinamide is really helping in the formula.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,It pills. A lot.,"I really wanted to like this, but it PILLS so much. The only way to get it to NOT pill is to use way too little product for good SPF coverage. I‚Äôm not even finishing it - back to Neogen for me."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Loving My New Glow,"I have dry skin and usually when I use sunscreen it tends to either be too oily and break me out or too dry and clings to certain dry patch areas even with moisturizer, but with this product it has worked great with my skin and I haven't had any issues like that. I find this sunscreen is very light and doesn't leave a white cast at all which is nice, and it definitely gives you an immediate glow. You don`t need to use a whole lot of this product so it last a long time. If you were wondering about the smell, it does still smell like regular sunscreen to me, but personally I don`t mind that."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,"Bad smell, burned","Smells so bad, like there‚Äôs so many chemicals in it. It actually burned when I put it on. I have dry skin and this dried my skin even more, little flakes were literally coming off my face. I love glow products in general but this SPF is a no."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,This does NOT play well with others,Adding this into my daytime routine has proven very difficult with this SPF. IT PILLS and at this price point it shouldn‚Äôt be happening. At all. It can work if it‚Äôs maybe the only thing you‚Äôre face. It‚Äôs aHARD NO for me
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Great little sunscreen,I really love this product it‚Äôs light and airy with a great smell I have very sensitive to breakouts with products and this one causes no breakouts however I wish you didn‚Äôt have to re-apply so much personally I put it on once then my makeup but it gets the job done
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Give your skin a glow but...,"I will admit this sunscreen does give My skin a nice glow but I have found a few downsides with this sunscreen. I feel like this product is like a 3.5 but I couldn't find that as an option. like I mentioned earlier It does give you a nice glow and it's reef safe. But the downside is that my sunscreen seems to ball up in little white clumps on my face. The more friction you use to try to remove it or wipe it off, the worse it gets. It gives a bit of a white cast but nothing crazy and the price point is kind of high."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,"I didn‚Äôt like the really heavy sent and the shiny effect. It didn‚Äôt give me glow, I have combination skin but it was very very shinny, not the natural glow I was hoping for. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,"Loves how this looks on my skin, it‚Äôs super hydrating, blends nice and smells like watermelon BUT I had to return because it pills SO bad during application and throughout the day. Had to return :("
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,My new go-to,"Great sunscreen. My skin tends to break out with sunscreen and this does not cause my skin to break out. In fact, I think my skin looked better than usual after a week of wearing the sunscreen! It's lightweight but has good long-wearing sun protection after just one application.  I never burned my face in my whole week at the beach. I don't wear makeup so I can't speak to it under makeup, but I'll definitely be purchasing this in the future."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,massive pulling,"This pills even without makeup. I love glow recipe, but I wouldn‚Äôt use this if I was planning on wearing makeup over top. Typically I love glow recipe, not sure what went wrong."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Lots of pilling,"I wish this worked for me because the glow it leaves behind is amazing! But it pills like crazy! The consistency is kinda thick and requires a lot of working into the skin. It unfortunately would also break up my makeup, especially around the nose and smile lines.
I got it bc of the hype but had to quickly return it. I‚Äôll stick with Dr. Jart Sun Fluid SPF 50+ (which also leaves a nice luminous/glowy finish)"
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Singapore,Miss,"I love Glow Recipe, however this is the worst sunscreen I ever used. It peels like crazy. I searched YouTube video on how to apply it, still peels. There is one time I managed to apply it but it took so much time‚Ä¶ after wearing mask, I can see the granules on my face. Also my eyes were tearing because of it. Very disappointed. Will it use on my body..

GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Singapore,Holy Grail,"I really need to use sunscreen more often but hate the nasty oily smell. This?

"
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,I‚Äôve bought this 3-4 times and I love that it leaves my skin very glowy but it pills. Maybe I‚Äôm rubbing it in too hard?
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,solid item,I feel like people hate on the sunscreen just because they want to fit in but this sunscreens actually really good and it wears good under my make up I‚Äôm almost done with it might repurchase
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,"Leaves my skin glowy without looking oily or sweaty.

GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Do not recommend,"As much as I wanted to like this product, it's just not good. I love Glow Recipe and i've tried this product many other ways but each time it was the same outcome- bad. No matter how you apply it or what base you use under it, this product has a lot of white cast and it piles up all over the face. You can see small white buildup all over your face throughout the whole day."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Singapore,Disappointing,"I had Looked  forward to trying this after seeing a review by my fav KOI. However, this stung my eyes and pilled a lot on both my face and body. Shld have stuck with my Supergoop and  other Japanese sunscreen."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,"I am a Glow Recipe lover but I just can‚Äôt love this product. After a short while of this being on, it leaves my skin with a really weird texture. Also, I‚Äôm a contact wearer, and it always makes them cloud up. I even completely avoid my eye area and it still manages to coat my contacts. Luckily no burning with that. I want to love this product so bad but I just can‚Äôt."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,I hate this so much,"I hate this sunscreen so much it makes me actually angry whenever I use it. I don‚Äôt know how this got past testing phase without anyone pulling the plug. The way to make it work without pilling and flaking is to do one small section at a time, rub in only until it‚Äôs spread around and then never ever touch it again. You can make it work but there‚Äôs such better options."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Luxury in a Bottle,"LOVE this sunscreen! First off, the smell is amazing. The texture is light and smooth. This is my go to sunscreen for day to day use. I work out out a lot and was very excited that it‚Äôs not at all runny or greasy when my body starts to sweat. I highly recommend Glow Recipe and the products that they put on the skincare market, so it‚Äôs no surprise this was another home run from this brand!"
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Malaysia,Moisturizing,I've been using this for a month. It's really moisturising and glowy. Sometimes too glowy it looks greasy especially if you don't wait for it to absorb. Has this minty feel to it that makes it feel refreshing.  
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,"Beautiful to wear on its own. Doesn‚Äôt play well with all makeup, and when I tried to use it after the plum plump moisturizer, it pilled. Do be careful around your eyes, it stings. Whenever I wear this I get compliments on my skin."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glad I didn‚Äôt let the negative reviews scare me,This has been the best SPF I‚Äôve owned I wear it daily with or no makeup in the hot humid sunny weather I‚Äôm from the south. Once I apply this product it smells like a hint of watermelon and ofc that SPF smell however it goes away within seconds. I am olive toned so I will have a white/gray cast but it doesn‚Äôt last too long either once it sets in within minutes my face is clear as day. I have no issues with this at all. It does not rub off or peel off . I‚Äôm very athletic so I run outdoors a lot in and I can a-test it is sweat proof and will not burn if it gets into your eyes. It has helped from preventing dark spots and I have not experienced any breakouts either. It gets the job done on my training days and blends perfectly with my makeup on my full glam nights
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Not my fave to wear. Love the smell and feel but flakes and it‚Äôs not easy to blend
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,"This is my current favorite sunscreen. The bottle is small enough to fit in my very small purse but the product has lasted me through the summer. It doesn't take a lot to cover my face and it leaves a nice glow on my skin. It has a faint watermelon scent, which I love but others may be sensitive to, so be aware of that. It also is quite dewy, so it isn't ideal for under makeup or if you want matte skin. But if you want a dewy glow and some nice long term benefits, I would recommend this sunscreen."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,calling all scent sensitive gals,"for my scent sensitive ladies, i personally got this product because i hate the smell of typical sunscreens and i thought this would smell like watermelons (like their niacinamide dew drops). but it smells like an ordinary generic sunscreen. i also felt it was heavy and sticky on the skin even when i applied a very small amount. i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the price personally so i will be returning :/"
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Malaysia,Good,This is a nice sunscreen for people with normal or dry skin. It is overly glowy on me though as I have oily skin. I find myself needing to use mattifying makeup over it. 
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,i like this that because this does not smell like the usual sunblock/sunscreen.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,works like a charm,"I have used this everyday for around 3 weeks now and I love it! It has played nicely with all my products and I haven‚Äôt had the issue at all of things pilling up? I use the snail line from peach slices and niacinamide/acids from inky list and no problems. I will say if you lean more oily skip your moisturizer when using this. Overall gives a nice glow, sun protection and works well with other products. P.s. maybe the pilling is from not letting each product like fully sink in?"
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,pilling and sticky,"I hated this sunscreen after wanting to love it. I got a sample and took it to golf with me for my arms and legs. After less than 10 minutes of wear, it was pilling and rubbing off. And felt so sticky. I could not wait to wash this stuff off my body!"
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Malaysia,White cast,"I‚Äôve loved every other glow recipe product I‚Äôve used until this sunscreen.
This leaves a white cast on my face. Not my fave from glow recipe. I will not repurchase. Buy at your own risk"
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Wanted to love it,"Sunscreen has become one of my favorite parts of skincare, and I was really excited when I heard Glow Recipe was coming out with this! Sadly I was quite disappointed...

I have combo skin and found this was a bit too oily for me. By the end of the day my skin was SO shiny... It also pills so that and the shininess makes it hard to reapply as you're supposed to. 

I would not recommend this product, as you can probably find something better for a better price. I'll go back to my trusty Missha sun milk until there's something else new to try!"
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,A great everyday SPF,I love this SPF. I use it everyday as my moisturizer and it does the trick. I like that it has niacinamide. The smell is great and a little goes a long way.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Okay for daily but nothing special,There‚Äôs nothing special about it. You do have to wait a while for it to set into your face. I didn‚Äôt see any white cast. It does settle into your face smoothly. It‚Äôs okay.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Peels horribly,"I wanted to love this sunscreen, but it peels horribly. Using it after other skin products or no products at all it still peels."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Really wanted to like this.,"Horrible. Pills instantly and flakes. Even if used alone. Does make your face look glowy and doesnt leave a white cast, but pills horribly, especially on the neck and hairline. Will be returning."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,USE ALONE,"I could not figure out how to apply this product and have it not pill/ball up for most of the summer.  I read the reviews warning of this problem but thought maybe it was exaggerated because there were so many other good reviews I thought I would give it a try.  After trying it over and over again I think I figured out how to apply but there are too many caveats for me to buy again.

Pros-
-Great for my dry and sensitive skin. 
-White cast does go away after rubbing (but I do have pale skin)
-Skin looks dewy and pearlescent, no tint but to me gives a great ""no makeup"" makeup look.
-No scent.
-Didn't burn my eyes.



Cons-
- I can ONLY WEAR IT BY ITSELF.  No essence; no serum; no toner; no makeup (I tried under eye concealer and blush) under or on top of; no water on my face, hands, or hair line, OR IT WILL PILL UP/FLAKE OFF IMMEDIATELY.
-When applying I can only apply about a finger tip dab amount at a time to one area of my face, rub it until the white cast is gone (maybe two or three seconds) and then stop rubbing and apply in next area of face.  If I apply about a quarter/ generous dollop amount and massage into face or, God forbid,  keep massaging after white cast has gone it will PILL UP AND FLAKE OFF IMMEDIATELY.
-And when I say flake off I mean it looks like the whole product crumbles like parmesan cheese all over the place and you have to keep brushing it off your neck, lip gloss, eye lashes and clothes for the rest of the day. 
- Am not great at reapplying sun screen like you should but imagine that would be impossible for me and have it not flake off."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,I don't hate it,It does some pilling even with all Glow Recipe products underneath. So I use it on my arms and legs and it is better there. I use it on my face when I barely have anything on and don't use a lot. Won't be buying it again but glad I tried it.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,PILLS,"No. Just no. If you put anything on your skin before this, it will pill. And I like to use at least a vitamin C serum before sunscreen. The way to avoid pilling is to apply in very small little sections slowly and rub lightly and pat in, and ain't nobody got time for that. I can't decide if I will donate this or keep as an early AM gym sunscreen when I have nothing else on my face."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,I love this sunscreen!! In the morning I apply a vitamin C and a light weight moisturizer then after that all drys down I add this sunscreen on top it goes on my skin so nicely doesn‚Äôt irritate my eye. It leave my skin with a nice glow without any oiliness. I think this sunscreen is best for dry skin like mine.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Money not well spent!,I really wanted to like this product.  But with all the hype I dont feel its anything special. I USE  a department store face SPF that I prefer. I dont see this one becoming my go to at all. It always leaves my face feeling tacky. I  personally don't always wear a full dace of makeup so Its NOT for me.  I do think it has a nice smell. I do not foresee myself purchasing it again.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,THE BEST,I‚Äôm not one to spend to much money on skincare and believe drugstore brands or the inkey list and the ordinary can do better than more expensive brands but‚Ä¶ this is literally the best facial sunscreen I‚Äôve ever had- doesn‚Äôt irritate my sensitive eyes- has a cooling effect for a very long time somehow- not a fan of fragrance in general but this one has just enough where it covers the sunscreen smell without being obnoxious and love the high spf- also no white cast at all and not heavy on skin
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,best sunscreen ever!,I love this sunscreen. Got a mini size in another set I bought and then bought full size after using. It smells great and makes my skin feel great too. Doesn‚Äôt make me break out like other sunscreens either. It is not greasy and doesn‚Äôt leave my skin greasy either. This is a must have for outdoors! Love this product!!
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,I only bought because it‚Äôs a watermelon sunscreen,"I‚Äôm not used to buying such expensive sunscreens.  I don‚Äôt wear sunscreen daily (I don‚Äôt wear makeup either).  This sunscreen is nice, in my opinion.  I have worn it a few times on days I know I will be out in the sun for any extended period.  It is not totally matte, but it‚Äôs not super greasy either.  I have oily skin, so this being oil-free and non-comedogenic is what drew me to this product (and because it smells like watermelon!).  I mix this with the Glow Recipe oil-free watermelon moisturizer to dilute it a bit.  The only time I‚Äôve tried putting this on my face full-strength is when I am going indoor tanning, which is why I bought it.
Overall, this is a great sunscreen for my needs and I may purchase it again, but for what most other people are using it for (under makeup, reapplying, hoping it won‚Äôt leave a white cast, etc.) I can‚Äôt be the judge of that because I don‚Äôt care about / use it in that way."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Perfect for pool days out in the sun. Love that it has zinc. Also sits nicely under makeup.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Don't do it.,"Don't do it. This sunscreen pills so badly. I've tried EVERYTHING to get it to not pill, but no matter what you do or how long you wait...it will pill. I'm now using it as an expensive body sunscreen just to use it up. Don't put yourself through this."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Not worth it,I would not recommend this product since it does not get into the skin at all. After an hour or so the cream starts separating on the skin
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Malaysia,It works,"Bought this and all the watermelon line. I don‚Äôt experience any pilling at all even using other consistency like gel, water cream and moisturizer underneath this sunscreen. Saw many bad reviews saying it will pills, but on my skin it really doesn‚Äôt. I have combination skin, no break outs or stinging or white cast. Very glowy and doesn‚Äôt feels thick on the skin. "
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,holy grail spf,"I think I‚Äôve found my holy grail SPF for my face! I am extremely fair skinned. If I‚Äôm in the Sun for 5 minutes I literally turn pink. I wore this on my face the past two days at the pool for 5 hours each day and my face didn‚Äôt burn‚Ä¶.at all.  I don‚Äôt think I would wear this under makeup just because of the consistency, but for outside days with no makeup this will for sure be on my face."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Disappointing,"I use a plethora of glow recipe products, from their cleanser to their serums, toner and even creams. I have never felt so let down by a product. No matter what moisturizer I use under this (a gel or lotion) this sunscreen pills. My entire face is covered in white pilling spots. The sunscreen smells nice and feels fine but it is completely unusable."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,I use it on bare skin and at the end of the day- my face feel so soft and smooth. I have been using it for a few weeks now and I really like how healthy my skin feels. The bottle is small but I think it‚Äôs worth it.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,I wear this under my makeup. I haven‚Äôt had any problems with pilling or anything else. Love the scent and the glow it gives
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,"I ended up retuning this product, but it just wasn‚Äôt for my skin sadly!"
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Pills like crazy over moisturizer.  So annoying.  I don‚Äôt have time in the AM to wait
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glad I picked this up!,"This pills super bad if you use it over moisturizer or other skin products, you need to wait a while before applying sunscreen but otherwise, it‚Äôs an amazing product!"
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Greasy feel,"I wanted to love this because I love Glow Recipe, but contrary to its description, it does have a greasy feel to it. I noticed when I added this to my routine, I had an increase in comedones & cystic acne. I never experienced any pilling that others have claimed, however. It sat on top of my toner & serum nicely, and I was able to apply makeup on top of the sunscreen without any issues. Sadly I‚Äôll be switching this out for another once I finish the bottle."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Super Smooth and Glowy!,"I was a bit hesitant to try this product out given that everyone was saying it was pretty hit or miss and it pilled like crazy, however I didnt experience any of that! The sunscreen went on like a dream: super smooth, no pilling, and no white cast!! It gave me such a beautiful glow and I am just so in love."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,this sunscreen is probably the BEST one i‚Äôve ever used! i‚Äôve had it for 3 months now and it makes you SOOOO glowy and protects you from the sun. i would 10/10 recommend this to everyone.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,"I really wanted to love this sunscreen, but it pills so badly. Once it started to pill on my face, I decided to just use it on my chest and arms, it pulled there too creating a chunky mess on my skin :-("
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,Seeing all the good reviews so decided to give it a try. I did not expect to be sticky. It‚Äôs a bit on the thick side which I do not like especially in summer when it gets hot and feeling sticky on your face is just not very pleasant.  I like it‚Äôs SPF 50. I will not purchase it again though.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,This sunscreen could‚Äôve been good but it pills on your face and ruins any make up you put on top. I would not recommend this sunscreen from glow recipe.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Needs some work but good,"I‚Äôve used this as a daily sunscreen on its own without makeup. For me, this works if I add moisture before applying but for acne prone skin that may not be a great option for you."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,PILLS,"I have tried absolutely everything to try to make this work. As many have said it pills and that‚Äôs what annoys me.
The reason I gave it a two was that I was too lazy to go return it so now I just mix it with my body moisturizer and use it like that on my arms and legs. (Yes, I‚Äôve also tried applying it with my face moisturizer mixed together and still pills, not sure why it doesn‚Äôt with the rest of my body)."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,pass,"I love glow recipe but this is a huge miss. This sunscreen pills up on itself dramatically. I‚Äôve used a variety of base skincare products, including only Glow Recipe, and it pills the same every time. It does eventually blend out once you wipe away all the pilling but I don‚Äôt think you should have to work that hard for a sunscreen. These are my results using the recommended amount of sunscreen (two fingers length for the face, one finger length for the neck). It does leave a really natural glow to the skin, but there‚Äôs plenty of sunscreens that will work as well for a cheaper price. I recommend trying out some other Korean and Japanese sunscreens! It‚Äôs usually a better bang for your buck too."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,"It's ok. Too shiny for me, and this sunscreen travels. An hour into wearing it, my eyes sting and I taste sunscreen in my mouth."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Pills so much!!!,"I wanted to love this SPF because I love so many of Glow Recipe‚Äôs other products, but ugh this just pills too much on my skin, it‚Äôs crazy! I even wait for my moisturizer (I use the Banana cream one from Glow Recipe which I LOVE) to set in, but still so much pilling! Won‚Äôt be purchasing again."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Unsure,"Got this sunscreen because I enjoyed using the glow drops serum, but I would have to apply them with an spf everyday which interfered with it's scent and the silkiness. Unfortunately, this product does not have the same smoothing/illuminating effects. The solution tends to leave me feeling dull and uneven in texture, it is pretty grainy if the bottle is not thoroughly shaken. This gets 3 stars because it works for sun protection and still improved skins appearance, it just didn't work as well at hydrating and softening."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Not for oily skin and stings my eyes.,I had really high hopes for this sunscreen but it‚Äôs not for me. I have oily skin and it just makes my skin feel heavy. It stings and it transfers to my eyes. I wear contacts so for most of the day I‚Äôll have a film over my contacts or if I‚Äôm not wearing contacts then my eyes will sting all day long. Also it burns for a good 15 minutes after putting it on. I won‚Äôt be repurchasing this.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,"If you don‚Äôt use other products with this, it peels. I really wanted to love it. It was between this and the super goop. One day I was in a hurry and didn‚Äôt apply a serum or anything else, and it definitely peeled I was pretty disappointed."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Great product,Great product! Blends decently into my skin but could rub in a bit better (I also have darker skin). Love this brand partly because all of their products just smell so good! Would definitely recommend.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Ineffective,Wore this outside for a 45 minute walk and got a slight sunburn. Glad I wasn‚Äôt out longer.
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50,USA,Waste of Money,"Wanted to love this product however for the insane amount of pilling, this is a waste of money 1000%! Does NOT play well w/any of my skincare on no-makeup days no matter how much I test various products to prevent pillling. Same goes for my make up (foundation, tinted moisturizer, or cushions) I used a variety of make-up techniques (brush, sponge, fingers) to apply but this sunscreen is terrible. Much prefer SuperGoop or Shiseido SPF."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,Singapore,Nice ,Nice combination of cosmetic and sunscreen in one product. But the shades are very limited. It may leave your face looking whitish instead of natural. But small amounts will work better with regards to the shade colour 
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Clean formula that is great for my skin,I‚Äôve been using this for 3 years now. I love it and it‚Äôs the one ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt make me break out. ‚ô•Ô∏è
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Not worth the purchase,"First - I bought this in February and it expired in October of the same year which is incredibly frustrating - there‚Äôs no way I would have used all of the product before it expired. I Wanted to love this but didn‚Äôt at all. It takes a few minutes to rub in / settle on your skin, but it still looks incredibly fake and thick. Also transfers extremely easily if you touch / something touches your face.  Ended up buying the OG Glow Screen and using it instead."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Way too thick and full coverage,"Extremely thick formula, I'm talking beyond full coverage. I couldn't even apply it it was so thick. Disappointing, I wanted to love."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Very heavy full coverage foundation is more like i,This is not medium coverage this is FULL coverage. While other people may prefer that I'm not interested as I don't really wear makeup that much anymore and I had to put some on because otherwise it looked like I had a mask on. It did also break down through the day which was more noticeable because it was so full coverage. It felt very thick and was hard to blend in because it looked streaky as it was sunscreen.
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++ - 100C (Fair With Cool Undertones),I liked the coverage of the original formula but this is still great. I‚Äôm lazy and love that I get sunscreen and a natural makeup look. It makes me feel pretty and keeps my morning routine short!
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Disappointing,"Disappointed. Like a thick foundation. Easy to accidentally leave streaks. Not for low-maintenance user, like me, who doesn‚Äôt want to spend the extra time to make sure my makeup is blended in."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,Malaysia,yes & amen!,"Love this, so practical. Sunblock & tint! Save time, money & effort. Suitable for dry skin. It does give a lil bit of oily finished but nothing a powder can‚Äôt fix! "
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,Malaysia,easy application,This product is easy apply to the skin. But u must be sure ur face is dry before applying. But because it‚Äôs not clear it gives the tint that I need without a need for me to put on any foundation
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Old formula match!,"It took me a while (ordered 4 different colors) but was able to match the old light/medium color with 230C - For all of my cult ladies, you're welcome!  I use a wet beauty blender and it goes on the same consistency as the old formula."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Holy Grail for Melasma / Hyperpigmentation,"I have melasma (dark brown-grey patches all over my face), and this product provides top-notch protection against all the UV factors that can exacerbate my condition!  For me, mineral, zinc oxide based sunscreens provide superior protection against UVA rays, and they don't absorb the rays and heat (which can trigger melasma) like chemical suncreens.  This particular sunscreen also is PA++++ (the best you can get with 4 + signs) for UV protection.  In addition, tinted physical sunblocks that use iron oxides for the tint provide protection against visible light (which is almost half of the light that we experience) and even blue light from computer devices.  This last part we all should be concerned with, but if you have melasma, it's critical to get a sunscreen that has iron oxides in it!  This CC Screen provides all the protection I need AND 90% coverage for my melasma patches.  I imagine that finding a good color match is key (since this is full coverage and like a foundation), and I really lucked out here -- I'm half Caucasian / half Asian, and 226W is perfect on me -- and it's not even orange!  It's a lovely light golden yellow base, and it's a better color match for me than any expensive foundation I've tried.  You just have to work in the product well, since it is a sunscreen first and foremost.  But once you do, the coverage looks so natural -- not greasy at all.  I wear this in the daytime, and I wear the Supergoop Tinted Mattescreen at night.  If you don't want foundation like coverage, get the tinted Mattescreen (it's a light neutral-beige, mousse-like texture)."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++ - 100C (Fair With Cool Undertones),"Very white cast, separates and flakes and does not fully set into your skin"
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Thumbs down,Cakey and dry. Felt gross and heavy on my skin.   Love their other products
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Love this- 3 steps in one,"3 steps in 1 product-replacing my foundation+SPF+powder.
This brightens and protects. Love it. I think it looks beautiful. Applies kinda dry on face when first applying since it‚Äôs mineral-based, but that‚Äôs OK since using a beauty blender sponge works well- and that also means it‚Äôs not oily. 

I love the Matte Screen also, which applies much more smoothly and blurs pores (the Matte Screen one) - but this CC Screen has a brighter shade, whereas the Matte Screen has a neutral tone.

The shade 215N is a tad light for me (usually I‚Äôm light medium neutral) but that‚Äôs OK because I love the brightening."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Bring back the Original CC formula!,"The original formula was a miracle product - it solved for sunscreen, foundation and hydration without clogging pores. Tested out the new formula in store and it was awful. Hope Supergoop! listens and brings back the original. There was/is nothing like it."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,got you some!,"I originally bought the super goop tinted mousse sunscreen and haven‚Äôt been able to find that so I figured I would try this and I like this one better! It‚Äôs definitely more moisturizing which is great for my dry skin. It absorbs after a few minutes so if you put it on at first and it feels greasy, that will go away. My daughter can‚Äôt stand sunscreen but has been stealing this from me! She says it‚Äôs great as a base for makeup. I wish I would have gone a shade darker but I usually just put on a darker bronzer or darker foundation on my contour areas. There is no smell. Great coverage: I definitely will be rebuying"

SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Hard to find a good shade,"Looking for a CC cream for a trip later in the summer. I wish this was available in stores because it‚Äôs hard to shade match online. The one I got from the shade finder looks too dark on the models and customer photos. I tried my best to guess based on undertone and shade (fair neutral/cool, picked 100C) but it was so cool that it made my lips and every lip product I own look orange. I added blush and bronzer and it pretty much matched my neck but I need to return it and try another shade, hopefully 105N is not too warm. I appreciate that they have cool tones available in the lighter shades unlike IT cc cream which runs very warm. It also felt very nice, didn‚Äôt break me out and stayed put through hours of walking in warm weather. I used All Nighter setting spray to keep it from rubbing off on my glasses but no powder because it was already so light. There was no pilling over the Protini moisturizer."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,So good with my acne and dry skin!!,"Even better than foundation!!! Foundation looks cakey on my dry and acne prone skin most of the time . However this, looks sooo smooth like nothing is on . Coverage is light medium. If I need more coverage I just add concealer to a spot. Lasts amazingly through out the day . color Doesn‚Äôt Oxides. Definitely repurchasing since I‚Äôm almost out !!"

"
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Bring back the old FORMULA!,"This new formula is so wired. Its like watery but thick at the same time,  it takes forever to blend and pills... the old formula was beautiful,  it applied like a moisturizer and set in so naturally,  please bring back the old formula!"
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,On the thick side but‚Ä¶,"Based on what the other reviews say about this, yes it is thick, and yes it is like a foundation. BUT if you‚Äôre someone like me who has acne scars, hyperpigmentation, and in general just stuff you want to cover, then you‚Äôll love this! I‚Äôve never been into tinted moisturizers because they never give me the coverage I want. But with this I‚Äôm getting a product with 50spf AND a decent amount of coverage. I LOVE this product. If you‚Äôre expecting something with very very light coverage, this isn‚Äôt it."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,My Fave - GORGEOUS glowy finish & medium+ coverage,"I was shocked at how lovely this was on my skin after trying a couple others (tried the IT cosmetics one and it was basically like theatre makeup... just awful & I couldn't wait to wash it off). This goes on thick in terms of knowing you're getting the SPF coverage, but blends well and the whiteness goes away after a minute. It looks radiant & glowy and has great coverage without being heavy or pancakey. I thought the color would be too light until it settled. If I add a little quick contour with some bronzer (i'd recommend since the coverage is medium+), it looks like my normal light liquid makeup face. It's really beautiful on the skin and doesn't feel uncomfortable (I don't like the feeling of Ilia spf serum for instance, it feels heavy and icky). So this is my fave by FAR and I hope they DO NOT CHANGE IT! 

FYI I'm 45, very pale & have some hyperpigmentation marks from months/years past of acne (late in life). Pic is of a quick application today with only blush and a tiny bit of bronzer added."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,DON‚ÄôT EVER DISCONTINUE,"At first I was mad they got rid of the original formula just like everyone else but give this a try! I actually love it just as much as the original now that I tried it! I think it‚Äôs super natural and pretty, it does not separate or settle into fine lines. I even use it under my eyes like a concealer and it does not crease! I‚Äôve worn it in the ocean and pool and it stays on and doesn‚Äôt budge, still looks amazing!I LOVE that it is 100% mineral sunscreen. I have super sensitive rosacea skin and this has never broken me out or irritated my skin! Please don‚Äôt ever discontinue this I don‚Äôt know what I would do if it was discontinued because literally nothing works for my skin! I use this as a foundation, it‚Äôs buildable and you can get it to a solid medium coverage. Or you can use less and use it as more of a tinted moisturizer."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,please don't ever discontinue this,"I don't know how this isn't 5 stars! I love it, I wanna throw out all my other bbs and sunscreens. I won't but I regret wasting my money on them."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Absolute favorite,"I‚Äôve used this for a year almost every day and absolutely love it. It gives a healthy glow, which often leads people to ask about my skincare routine, while in fact it‚Äôs this that‚Äôs doing all the work. When I first apply it, it‚Äôs a slightly grey colour but the colour settles in after a couple of minutes - I guess something to do with the spf, idk. I use a light dusting of Kat Von D or Laura Mercier translucent powder on top. It‚Äôs quite thick for a cc (about the same as Laura Mercier tinted moisturiser) so it might be too much coverage for someone just looking for sunscreen. Unseen Sunscreen would be better for that."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++ - 426W (Deep With Warm Undertones),I was hoping for a nice sunscreen with some tint. I was not a fan of the color tint. It feels very thick when applying and completely clogged my pores which resulted in breakouts.
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Too thick,Not what i expected. Too thick and dries very quick as you are rubbing it on. This is basically like foundation. It works best for me if i put moisturizer or oil on my face first. I give it 2 stars bc it has good coverage.  I enjoy other goop products but this was a fail for me. Now to continue looking for something lighter.
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,There Are Better Options,"I really wanted to like this since I love Unseen Sunscreen, but I wanted a mineral version with tint.  It was very thick and chalky.  The color match was just okay.  It might be okay to smear on for more heavy duty coverage in the summer, but it didn‚Äôt hit the mark for light, everyday wear for me.  Wish I could return it."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,Malaysia,Excellent!,"Good product by supergoop as always,maybe a little bit overpriced but still a good product nonetheless,wish they could make it not as heavy on the skin if possible tho                   "
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,They ruined a perfect product‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt bother,"I used this for yrs. At first with the new formulation I was excited to see all the new shades. But when I tried it, I was devastated. Totally pills, which I‚Äôm guessing is bc of the increase in titanium dioxide. It was my HG, but now I‚Äôm searching for a CC replacement, like SO many other reviews I‚Äôve seen."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,Malaysia,love it,I love their sunscreen so much and this CC cream eases my life! Well i dont need to wear foundation anymore. Love how it blends so easily using brush and look so natural on my face eventhough i wrongly chose one shade brighter. Kinda pricey and i hope we can have tester back in store 
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,Malaysia,smooth texture,In love with this cc screen 100% mineral cc cream with broad spectrum after my basic skincare. Blend it well with my skin and after my foundation and loose powder. 
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,not what i wanted,"I bought this product after a long search for a good tinted moisturizer. I tried it in store and it was fine and I love high spf so I bought it. I really wanted to like this product but I ended up really disappointed wearing it daily the next week or so. I felt like it was super thick and ended up looking cakey and dry. I was looking for something more natural and glowy and this just didn‚Äôt give me that, it was super matte but it would get greasy and crease around my face so I was disappointed and ended up returning for the Fenty skin tint which I like a lot better."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,The Old Formula was Better! Bring. It. Back.,"The new formula of this product is such a letdown. I was absolutely in LOVE with the old formula and probably would‚Äôve exclusively worn this product for the rest of time. This new formula feels different, doesn‚Äôt dry down, makes skin look worse when applied and this  formula broke my skin out, where as the old formula never did. Please, please, please, Supergoop! Bring back the old formula! This one is NOT working!"
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Miss the old formula,"Prefer the old formula over this new one 1000%. I wish they wouldn‚Äôt have reformulated it, it was perfect before."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,The new formula is not for me.,"I used to love this product, but when they reformulated with the new shades it stopped working for me. Now instead of blending into my skin like it used to, it looks cakey, dry and heavy. There is zero glow (and their glow screen is too much shimmer for an office job.) I‚Äôve tried using different primers and mixing with a moisturizer, but nothing works and I‚Äôm so sad. I even went in to a Sephora to get matched for the correct color. My hunt for a great SPF CC cream continues."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Great solution if you want sun protection,"great subtle coverage and of course the 50spf is awesome. Goes on easily with just your fingertips and blends well. The only thing is it definitely leaves a tacky feeling on your skin - which I prefer to the greasy feeling of most sunscreens, but I wish it just soaked in and didn't feel at all. HOWEVER, since it is a pigment, essentially makeup, that's not really a realistic expectation, so I still like it and prefer to use it over regular foundation! Lasts all day, too."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++ - 215N (Light With Neutral Undertones),"changed the formula. the last formula was amazing, I would wear it every day. the new formula is sticky, streaky and doesn't dry. wish super goop would bring back the old formula."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Love it for sensitive skin!,"I absolutely love this product! It is my everyday complexion makeup along with my regular concealer! It gives my skin such a fresh look, while correcting and covering some of imperfections."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Supergoop!

Just the right about of dew and spf 50!! 230 C is the best cool undertone foundation I have tried. I am so confused why the ratings are not high because I have tried so many foundations, but always go back to this"
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Skin looks dry with this product,"I was hoping this would be an awesome CC cream but it's really not. Upon putting it on, it is very thick and looks like you've got clay on your face. I had to add facial oil to it to get it to blend more evenly. Really not worth the hype."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,"It‚Äôs good, not great",I like it but I don‚Äôt love it. It doesn‚Äôt absorb fully and the coverage is a little chalky. It doesn‚Äôt irritate my eyes though.
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Do not buy,"Thick, very sticky, does not glide, even when wearing it on top of moisturized face. 
It is tinted, but still leave ashy finish. Do not waste your money, buy something else."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,best sun protection,"I know a lot of the reviewers hate the new formula. The trick is you have to apply by patting it on your face. If you rub, it will look cakey and dry. This is the absolute best for true sun protection. I wear it at the beach and it‚Äôs been my go to for long Beach days and even days in the Caribbean with intense sun."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Contains glitter! All day wetness!,This CC Screen stayed wet-looking on my face all day long. It absolutely never set and it smeared around my face all day. There is also a very fine gold glitter in it and I don‚Äôt like or need glitter on my face like that at all. I‚Äôve already initiated my return.
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++ - 100C (Fair With Cool Undertones),"I love super goop. Over the years I used the unseen sunscreen, so I thought I‚Äôd try the cc screen but it was heavy and ashy. My skin didn‚Äôt like the texture or color of this product."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,pleasantly surprised,I was hesitant to try this product again after so many years of not using it and personally not really loving the old formula. But I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised with it. It does dry as you apply so that maybe some of the ‚Äúdryness‚Äù that people feel but if you need to blend an area a little better and it‚Äôs dried I just take water or a water based moisturizer on my finger and work that area. The water rehydrates the formula really well. You could prob even use a serum. I didn‚Äôt apply moisturizer before using this once and it was for sure harder to apply to bare skin. But overall I like the new formula. For having normal to dry skin.
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Pleasantly surprised,"This has definitely grown on me. On the days I spend more time outside and still want some coverage, I like to wear this over another sunscreen layer to minimize the risk of taking away protection. I trust Supergoop products and love how they post their SPF efficacy reports for full disclosure. Also, so many other mineral-based tinted sunscreen products have red undertones or that sickly zinc-based bluish purple cast, so I was very pleased to see options for golden undertones that actually work for my skin. For reference, I wear 346W and my other shade matches are MAC NC42, NARS Syracuse, Fenty 310, and Estee Lauder Double Wear 4N2. Texture-wise, it's a thicker, almost mousse-like consistency that's similar to the PUR Bare It All foundation, if you've ever used that, so I find this applies best with fingers or a brush. I get medium buildable coverage with a natural matte finish, which I prefer. I only wish this was also water/sweat-resistant, but otherwise, this personally ticks every box for me. All in all, very pleasantly surprised by this product."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,THIS OXIDIZES,"First of all, I absolutely love the finish this gives. Idk why a lot of people don‚Äôt. I just if you‚Äôre looking for a matte finish then this wouldn‚Äôt suck to you. It is a bit weird to blend but that‚Äôs because it dries as it blends, kind of like the Fenty foundation. I appreciate this feature bc the finish not only is the finish dewy, it‚Äôs also not tacky and it creates a smooth film over the face, unlike the Ilia super serum tint (too oily). That aside, I have seen reviews about the colors being way off and at first I thought so too, but you have to remember this is a mineral sunscreen first and foremost. It takes time to blend in and oxidize to the correct shade so I really think everyone may be a shade lighter than they think. Because of this I don‚Äôt think the names are correct for this selection of shades. I am not fair, usually. This is the first time my correct shade is considered fair. I‚Äôm usually light skinned with yellow/warm undertones. So of course I didn‚Äôt go for the shade that actually matched me first, I went darker and it was a big mistake bc this oxidizes. The fair neutral turned out to be right for me because as it oxidizes it turns more warm. Frankly, this matches me more than any foundation ever has! So glad I didn‚Äôt listen to the reps at Sephora and just got sample of the shade I thought I‚Äôd be and one lighter. Try this out before you give up on this amazing cc cream."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Great for Working from Home,"I won‚Äôt wear makeup when I work from home, but I also want to look decent for video calls. This is a really nice sunscreen / half makeup / half skincare. I was skeptical when I first put it on because it washed me out and didn‚Äôt seem to apply evenly, but it looks great when I brush it out a bit with my foundation brush and use blush to warm it up. It stays well, looks natural, and feels light enough to work from home in. Also love that is has SPF."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Supergoop!

The texture is thick and feels heavy on the skin, the color did not match and it left my skin feeling streaky."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Skip This - Old Formula was MUCH better,The old formula was so much better. It was my holy grail. This product settles in lines and pores even with primer - it doesn‚Äôt spread or blend well. I could NOT find a good color match. There are hundreds of other products you can try - skip this.
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Holy Grail Foundation,"I loved the older version of this product, and I had to adjust to the reformulation. Now that I‚Äôm used to the new version of this product, I am amazed! I love how it wears on the skin. It is long lasting with a beautiful finish. I can use all creams or all powders with this foundation. It‚Äôs a great product and I hope Supergoop keeps it around for a long time!"
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,Malaysia,the best ,"Legit the best. I don‚Äôt even use my foundations atm. It covers up and protects. I have at least two sunscreens in my bag at all times, but this is still my go to. I have to pair it with a gel moisturiser though because it can get a little thick. "

CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++ - 100C (Fair With Cool Undertones),"I use Supergoop‚Äôs sunscreen daily so I was so excited when I saw they had a cc cream! I don‚Äôt really like the feeling of foundation so this is a great way to get some coverage without a full coverage foundation. This color is a perfect match for when my face is not tan during the winter. I wish it were a tad lighter in consistency, but other than, that I love it!"
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Too shiny,"I was hoping this would be a tinted version of their Unseen sunscreen. However, it's MUCH shinier and does not have the nice velvety blurring effect of the Unseen. This was just a classic tinted sunscreen - very shiny on the face."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++ - 426W (Deep With Warm Undertones),"If your Fenty foundation is in the 400s, skip this. I got the darkest shade, and it‚Äôs still wayyyy too light (I‚Äôm a Fenty 440, for reference). The formula is thick and tacky, awful to spread, even when applied over oil. It‚Äôs drying and leaves skin looking ashy. I‚Äôm thoroughly disappointed."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Very thick,"This sunscreen is true to it's name super goop = super thick. It's not easy to spread it evenly on the skin, not enough slip; I already used a moisturizer underneath. Maybe this product will work better for oily skin.
The 2 stars are for it being physical sunscreen and the finish is nice. It gives the skin a smooth soft looking sheen."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,Singapore,Supergoop cc screen 100% mineral cc cream ,This sunscreen is amazing as it‚Äôs tinted but it doesn‚Äôt rlly suit my skin type as I have combination skin. Makes my face pretty oily after a few hours of application which I‚Äôm not really used to.  
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,It works great!!,"I love this CC cream from Supergoop! I have dry skin that's prone to rosasea, hyperpigmentation, dehydration and acne. It is hard to find products that help with all that. It does not irritate my sensitive skin.. My skin looks better since i started using it. The coverage is great because it covers my blemishes and scars well without it feeling heavy and cakey. The SPF mineral is not to be included with the formula. It is definitely my favorite right now!"
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Great Protection,"I really enjoy using Super Goops CC Cream. First and foremost, I never use a Cc without a high SPF and this one has 50! Working outside 50% of the time, that is clutch. The color also blends really well- easily and effortlessly although I would definitely recommend shaking the bottle (or any liquid BB/CC cream) prior to applying to make sure it‚Äôs mixed thoroughly. It‚Äôs a great product and I will continue to use it."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Love this!!,I absolutely love everything Supergoop!! This 100% mineral SPF sunscreen it‚Äôs amazing!

This is always been one of my go to brands I absolutely love them!
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,"Love how the finish looks, but feels tacky","Love this sunscreen. It gives a very natural finish. I was afraid the shade was going to be too dark for my skin tone but once blended, it matched my skin perfectly. It does feel a bit tacky but it doesn‚Äôt bother me too much. I can always just use powder on top to take the tackiness away."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Amazing!,"I received the Supergoop CC Screen and the Unseen sunscreen from Supergoop in exchange for my honest review. I have to say I was very impressed with both of these! 

The CC Screen was the perfect shade for me! I love that it has 50 SPF and it does not leave a weird white cast or shine on my face! The same for the Unseen Screen! This sunscreen has 40 SPF and feels so light on my skin. No white cast again! Both of these worked so well with my makeup and didn‚Äôt make me look super shiny like other face sunscreens I‚Äôve tried. These products are for all skin types and cruelty free! I would definitely recommend trying these!"

This left a white cast on my face and I feel like the other shade up is too dark. I would recommend to people who live in sunny areas but not for everyone. It is lightweight.
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Good complement,"I was curious with this product with mineral, I don't know if the composition is better for the skin but I like how it feels in my face skin, I don't feel it heavy, it covers very well and fit with my skin tone, I feel more protect, that gives me confidence"
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Best CC Cream with Sunscreen!,"First off I didn't have high expectations for this product. Most CC creams have horrible coverage and products with sunscreen smell strong. Not this CC Cream it has amazing, bulidable coverage and doesn't contain any fragrances. Also I love how it melts into the skin, makes it look like I'm not wearing anything at all. It doesn't crease or move around. And it feels so light on the skin. This is my new everyday face makeup. I'd definitely recommend."

The cc cream easily evens out my skin tone and also helps brighten up my under eyes while providing protection from the sun. I like that this works great for a no makeup makeup look, I can just pack this in my bag and apply on the go without worrying about my uneven skin tone! If Im wearing a full face I will apply my unseen sunscreen before the bb cream."

SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Love it,I really like this cc cream. It goes on smoothly and feels super lightweight. The coverage is pretty light but it does reduce some redness. I have freckles and this product does a good job of not making them look dirty or weird so that‚Äôs good.
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Great!,"I like this cc cream a lot. 
The coverage is great and perfect for using during the day. 
I love products with spf and this one has a good sun protection at SPF 50.  This cc cream is similar a foundation with medium coverage."
SUPERGOOP!-CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! CC Screen 100% Mineral CC Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++ - 100C (Fair With Cool Undertones),Love everything I‚Äôve tried from this brand. I have a few of their other types of sunscreens and they all work very well. This cc cream is great too. It blends well and feels moisturizing. Doesn‚Äôt feel or smell like your typical mineral spf. Just like other cc creams it has a light coverage which I prefer
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheerscreen SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,Ms ,I use this product for long time. Second time buy this product. Got Natural look skin. Good to buy. Just bit expensive. Hope got more promotion. Gooooooooooooooood
JILL STUART-Everyday Bright UV Protector Tone Up Lavender White Floral Sunscreen,Philippines,UV protectir,"The scent is great but too strong for me. Too perfumy and Im not comfortable w heavy scents on my face. This might be good in countries where u can try this during winter. I bought this coz it's supposed to be ""gel"" and I live in a hot humid country but this is more like an emulsion, way much more creamier than I expected and not 'gel-ly"" enough. "
JILL STUART-Everyday Bright UV Protector Tone Up Lavender White Floral Sunscreen,Singapore,Wonderful sun protector ,"I have very sensitive skin and no other sun screen suit me. I have been using JS sun protector from many years. Before covid, I still able to travel to stock-up JS sun protector. But now no travellinganymore, but thank you Sephora for bring in JS Sun protector. üåû
Love Sephora. 
Please bring me some more JS products! not sure if JS sun protector Aqua chiffon W still available?"
CAUDALIE-Vinosun Very High Protection Lightweight Cream SPF 50+,Singapore,all in one!!,"Was looking for something like this!!!
Smells like honey!!! And textures really light also doesnt have the sunscreen smell (tbh i like the sunscreen smell). Was actually looking for something like this, like a sunscreen that protects against uva and uvb so this is like the perfect sunscreen! 

Box was open when i got it so gonna give a 4/5 stars"
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Lean Screen Mineral Mattifying SPF 50+,Singapore,A little drying,I have combination skin but I find this sun screen too drying for my face as it drags across the skin. Was hoping to love it but I think it doesn't work for me. Perhaps more suitable for more oily skin.
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Lean Screen Mineral Mattifying SPF 50+,Malaysia,NEW HG Product,"I love this mineral sunscreen, it feels light on the skin without feeling super greasy, cause I have oily dehydrated combo skin,as it stated its a mattifying sunscreen but it wont leave my skin feeling tight and dry.It also leave a sheer luminousity on the skin which i really love! My new holy grail products ‚ù§Ô∏è"
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Lean Screen Mineral Mattifying SPF 50+,Singapore,best sunscreen,"This mineral sunscreen wears on the skin beautifully with no white cast. It has the perfect amount of coverage to brighten dull skin and it does not get cakey. 

Despite it being a mattifying formula, I find that it does not dry out my skin. It works best if you apply and blend in sections instead of applying it to the whole face because it does set quite fast. 

Still, very impressed and this is my new holy grail sunscreen!"
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Lean Screen Mineral Mattifying SPF 50+,Singapore,perfect tinted sunscreen ,"I was looking for a good SPF 50+ sunscreen that wouldn‚Äôt dry out my skin. The Ultra Violette checks all the boxes: gives a nice light overall tint, non-tacky feel, overall comfortable sit on the face. No breakouts so far."
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Lean Screen Mineral Mattifying SPF 50+,Singapore,Want to love it but can't. It's everything it's not supposed to be.,"The consistency and texture is thick like toothpaste. It never seems to ""dry"" and form that even protective layer. I can put it on at 7am and wait till 9am and my face will still be moist and sticky. It never becomes or looks matt. It oxidises, makes me look like a oily wok and gets on everything. From my long shirt sleeve when I shield my face to all my make up pencils, brushes, sponges, it stains everything and it never stops coming off! My make up powder (which I dont even apply a lot of) cakes on it. I really want to love it - it probably is one of the safest and high zinc content sunblocks that is cruelty free.. but I can't. I heard that Ultra Violette was created by people who knew that their products needed to work with make up but this is the total opposite of that goal. I'm really disappointed. I'm now rethinking if I want to try their other sunscreen or leave this expensive, ill-promised brand altogether :( It didnt work well for me, I unfortunately, dont recommend it. The formula definitely needs re-working. "
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Lean Screen Mineral Mattifying SPF 50+,Malaysia,fall in love ,"I immediately fell in love the moment it touches my skin. love love love it. it has matte finish. so far the only mineral sunscreen that doesn't make my face looks oily. definitely my new found love, will buy this over and over again until i find cheaper alternative with the same quality "
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Lean Screen Mineral Mattifying SPF 50+,Malaysia,Ultra Violette Lean Screen,"Finally found my holy grail sunscreen!! if you are looking for matte mineral suncsreen then this is for you.it finishes is semi matte, no white cast, easy to spread below and also on top of makeup. it have a slight tint to it that makes you will look like you re wearing tinted mosturiser which means that u can skipped your foundation, walla!! but for those who need more coverage of cos this by itself is not enough, u still need to layer your concealer or foundation.

i have been using this almost for two weeks, fo far theres no reaction to my skin, it doesnt sting my eyes, it doesnt clogged mg pores, it doesnt make me break out. the texture of this sunscreen is a bit thick however u need to spread it evenly to have a beautiul finish.
. 

since im using this, i always reapply during mid day, i directly apply on top of the makeupthat i have but it still working very well. you need to know that u suppose to reapplt your sunscreen. 

sometime when i wake up in the morning, im so lazy to take shower because thats weeekend baby. i will juat apply this on bare skin and it still looks good. i feel good because im so happy knowing that my skin i prrotected  while im enjoying using this product as much as makeup. 

one of the most important thing to note here is this producy does not PILL. it doesnt intereferewith your skin care which really amaze me. how could i not fall in live with this..now i reach  for this  product everdayyy  and will continue to do so until im getting ollllldd. 

for someone who prefer mineral suncreen ibsted of chemical one, pls pls pls get this,u wil not regret. thanks Ultra  Violette for making a very wonderfull product.  my faith towards sunscreen is restored!
"
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Lean Screen Mineral Mattifying SPF 50+,Malaysia,Love this,Perfect if you love mineral sunscreen and are tan. Minimal white cast. I‚Äôd say I found one of my fav mineral sunscreen! No fragrance too! I don‚Äôt see the point of putting fragrance in sunscreen. So this is love.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,Malaysia,worst setting spray,"This quite literally the worst purchase I‚Äôve ever made. Finishing is oily, the make up breaks up because of it. Using this just for the sake of the spf
"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,Singapore,Supergroup resetting refreshing mist SPF 40,"Supergroop refreshing mist is easy to put in my bag. I can use it in everywhere I go. It is easy to spray no worry of re-apply the sunscreen for times. It is not oily, sticky and it absorbs into my skin fast. "
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Great for travel!,I love using this to touch up my SPF. It is small enough it easily fits in my bag. I don‚Äôt care for the scent. It is pretty strong. I would definitely like to see an unscented version.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,Singapore,Got it to reapply sunscreen over makeup,"Mix feeling. I bought this to reapply over make up. IF you are getting this, get the big bottle. The small travel size spray head is so horrible after 2 days it stop spraying properly i had to go exchange

 1) stings eyes so close eye if you spray 2) alcohol is strong and can sting *a little* on the skin when sprayed 3) oily finish if you dont dab/tap it in your face and touch up your make up. 4) *** it‚Äôs oily so when you spray it over your face it gets ON your hair and within 5 mins your hair will be so greasy and oily so you‚Äôll have to somehow cover your hair when you try and spray 

My current method is to spray on my hand and tap it onto my face then touch up a bit of make up. So this product is a little pointless because i found drugstore sunscreen spray that can be used on face with same method and cheaper. Alternative similar spray product to apply over make up : Anessa, sunplay, biore. "
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,Singapore,Super goop!,wowwww this isnt my first time purchasing it cuz its just sooo gooooood! I love it its not greasy on my face and it doesnt leave a white cast. Will purchase more
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Oily but Ok,"Was worried about the nozzle not working and how long the mini would last but I've had it for almost a month now and use it mostly on the go when I don't want to use my hands to reapply sunscreen. It sprays well enough, but I've noticed it can get a bit oily for me so I try to limit to 1 maybe 2 applications in a day if I'm out in full sun. This is my first spray sunscreen so I definitely want to try some others but I would recommend trying this too."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,Singapore,No good,"This is a terrible setting spray. It does not matify and it leaves an oily layer on your face. In the end, I can only use it as a sports spray on my face. When I am not using makeup at all. Cannot use with makeup on. It ruins it. Use on neck and body to recover my cost "
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Worst sprayer ever,I have 2 bottles one a replacement but now I know that it‚Äôs just a terribly made delivery. I‚Äôve used plenty of sprays with varying viscosity and this sprayer is not the proper one they need to be using. It‚Äôs stops working pretty quickly and becomes basically useless. Therefore wasted money.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Greasy and stings!,It felt greasy and stung my eyes even though I closed them tight. Gave my foundation a weird lifted look like it was separating from my skin. It‚Äôs not a good mist either it comes on thick and in dots.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Not my product,"Too sticky, if it is on your clean hear by chance it will look dirty in a second"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,It‚Äôs OK,"I‚Äôve used this product twice on my face. I followed the directions on the bottle and shook it before using it. First of all the spray basically squirted on to my face and was not much of a mist. After spraying the mist, some got on my hair and immediately turned it oily. I noticed it did make my makeup come off a little. I‚Äôm determined to make this product work because i love the idea of a sunscreen setting spray"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,"Leaks everywhere, nozzle clogs and dribbles",The actual sunscreen seems great but until they change the packaging and the spray device this product is trash. I‚Äôve tried the mini and now the full size and they both leak when carried on its side (like in a purse or bag). The spray nozzle gets clogged and it sprays out in globs and dribbles instead of any sort of mist. Don‚Äôt recommend this one.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Convenient and easy to use,"I actually find it super convenient and easy to use! But only for resetting during the day, it‚Äôs not a setting spray at all. I like the size of the mini it‚Äôs portable and cute"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,It ran out too quickly and it cost too much. I live in Houston Texas. So its sunny sunny all day everyday. I go through sunscreens like water. I wish there were better sunscreens and better prices for them.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,wouldn‚Äôt buy it again,"This does exactly what it says what it will do. I used this during three entire days in blistering sunny heat at Disney and universal and I didn‚Äôt get burned at all. I reapplied it multiple times throughout the day and it was really easy. It does burn your eyes when you spray it on your face (yes, I closed my eyes), and I would be able to look past this but like other reviews have mentioned the packaging is horrible. I didn‚Äôt personally have issues with the spray not coming out but over time I noticed the bottle would start to leak, now I don‚Äôt feel comfortable putting this in a bag or purse because it‚Äôs super oily and greasy. I will be using the rest of this product but I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again just for the packaging alone combined with the price."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Terrible,"When I bought my first one, the spray was very uneven from the first use. I tried clearing out nozzle, but it didn‚Äôt help. I really wanted this product to work, so I exchanged it to the new one and specifically tested it in the store to make sure the spray is even. 

Unfortunately, the nozzle clogged up just after couple uses. There is no way of fixing it. Every time I open it, I see the product leaking from the nozzle, even though I clean it all the time.

The product itself is VERY greasy. And to top it all off it started to spray solid particles, that can be absorbed, so now I have a ton of little grains of product stuck on my face.

Absolutely not worth it!!!"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,SO disappointing!,"I use this when I want an extra SPF boost for whatever reason. Recently I used it over a fresh face of makeup, fully set with products I know and love, and my makeup started pilling sooo bad! I only sprayed 2-3 times, drying each layer with my fan. I patted in the excess and still pilled my makeup, Very disappointing"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,It‚Äôs a NO for me,I really wanted to find an easier way to reapply my sunscreen during the day while making sure my make up stays great. I bought the mini one to try it out first. This product is an absolute FLOP!!! Instead of resetting my face it more so MELTED ALLLLLLL my makeup OFF. I had to go home immediately and wash my face and redo my whole look. I love supergoop products. But this is an absolute NO for me.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,"Good sunscreen, horrible bottle!","I love the sunscreen but not the bottle. Like other low reviews, this leaks!! I‚Äôve purchased this 3 times and had no issue with the first 2 bottles but this 3rd bottle has leaked like crazy and so much product has been wasted."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Faulty top spray nozzle,I would rate this higher but the spray bottle sucks so bad that so much of the mist comes out. This is the second time I bought this product and both times the spray nozzle is faulty and so much sunscreen messed leaks out. it‚Äôs frustrating when you‚Äôre paying for a product and so much of it is being wasted. I love supergoop products but this misses the mark when it comes to packaging. please fix this so I can buy one that works well.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Good for on the go touch up and not much else,I use this only as a way for a lazy girl to touch up sunscreen during the day without having to get messy and not as a setting spray because get this. As a setting spray it SUCKS. It‚Äôs oxidized and made orange basically any concealer or foundation I‚Äôve tried. So the only way I use this with make up on is with a healthy layer of regular setting spray underneath.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Reapply your SPF,Make sure you shake it A LOT if not that thing will squirt at you. But live the glow and long lasting
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"I read the reviews before purchasing and followed a tip saying it‚Äôs best to get the mini version and use the large version to refill. So, I went with the mini and I love it. The little nozzle sprays evenly. I haven‚Äôt had an issue with eye irritation. However, I haven‚Äôt used it as a setting spray as I use the Supergoop! tinted SPF 40 during daylight hours. It is a tad greasy so I‚Äôm afraid to use it over tinted my moisturizer. Highly recommend for a fresh face otherwise."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,Canada,love it!,Originally purchased years ago. Came back to it and still love it.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,it's a go to outdoor must have.,I used this product. I truly enjoys how refreshing it felt putting it on. dried fast and loved the seemed minty smell. it felt cool and nice.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Oily & slightly Irritates eyes,"Applied the product when walking around outside at an outlet mall in 90¬∞-100¬∞ Texas heat, feels a little oily when on. After an hour my eyes were stinging a bit from the sweat bringing the product down to my tear ducts and probably mixed w/ my mascara.  At the end of the day I was told my face looked really oily & I want to say I have combination or oily skin.

I tried the product again but w/ no makeup on at an outside garage gym in 90¬∞-100¬∞. I don‚Äôt think I was sweating that much since I was near a fan & my face didn‚Äôt look too oily but I lightly rubbed my eye 1-2 hours after application w/out thinking & my eye was lightly stinging again.

I use it throughout the day to run errands or where I won‚Äôt sweat a lot but I feel like that defeats the purpose of why I bought it.

I plan to use the rest of the product but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be buying it again unless they change the ingredients. It feels slightly oily & irritates my eyes if not careful."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,strong alcohol smell,"I just can't stand the smell of this spray. It is a very strong alcohol + lemony scent. It's not quite a mist. It's hard to use because you would want to avoid the eyes and lips areas, but there's no way to avoid that. And if it get into your eyes, it sting."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,literally sucks‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt spray out like a ‚Äúmist‚Äù at ALL. it sprays like it‚Äôs a water gun lol. it just shoots out a straight line and feels like you‚Äôre getting shot in the face.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Spray nozzle could use some improvement,"I like this product overall!  Used it on a trip to Mexico - beaches, sightseeing, etc - as a quick and easy way to re-apply some face SPF on the go.  I feel like it sufficiently helped to protect my skin in this environment!  It's a little too glowy for my oily skin, but powdering after helps, and since it's summer I'm just resigned to looking more dewy than preferred anyway :D  My two problems with this are 1) the spray nozzle wasn't great after the first few uses - it started spraying in large drops instead of a fine mist.  Wiping the nozzle before using helps a little, but not enough.  2) The price point.  This stuff is just too pricey for me.  I picked this up since I could throw it in my carry-on, but I just can't stomach paying so much for so little again."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"Love the SuperGoop product and delivery. No white caste, leaves makeup un-disturbed. Leaves a radiant finish that borders on greasy, so easy does it!"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Burns eyes & Darkened foundation,I wanted to like this but I have to find something else the first one I bought the nozzle broke I returned it and I should‚Äôve just gotten my money back because now the second one after using it burns my eye so bad and darkens my foundation by two or three shades terrible formula
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Sprays out tiny globs of hardened product :(,"I bought this to help refresh my spf as I'm trying to correct a dark spot problem and still be able to wear my make up. The pump on this product stopped working literally after one pump! My biggest issue aside from the packaging is that no matter how much or how long you shake the bottle for, it still leaves little globs of hardened product all over your face. I made the mistake on of using this as a finishing spray without double checking my fresh beat before stepping out. I had constant stares not only for being beautiful, but for the little spf globs that were akin to lint balls all over my face.The concept is amazing, but this product just doesn‚Äôt deliver. I gave it an extra star because I just love the brand and will continue to use unseen sunscreen when I go make up free"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,Very nice SPF!! It is not sticky and sits on face very well
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"This is the worst setting spray ever! Maybe it has potential as a sunscreen, but I barely can wear it as it‚Äôs not matte as it advertised and it‚Äôs not fixing your makeup, it‚Äôs melting your makeup. I bought it to refresh my sunscreen during the day on top of my makeup, but I can use it only without makeup. So what the point? On bare face I can just re-apply my normal sunscreen, for that I don‚Äôt need ‚Äòfancy‚Äô spray. Plus it smells horrible. Going back to Milani setting spray with SPF."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,It has potential.,"The concept of a SPF that you can reapply by misting is great, really! & I really wanted to like this product.

First & foremost, it‚Äôs marketed as ‚Äúmatte‚Äù, but even after shaking the bottle for a minute or so, it felt & looked greasy. Plus, it stung my eyes. After an hour or so, I was extra oily.

I wanted to give it a second chance, so I used the Unseen Sunscreen (which I love, 5/5 stars) & applied light makeup. When it was time to reapply SPF, I found that the nozzle leaked in my bag, & my purse smelled like it, & all my items were greasy/oily. Half of the product was gone. The nozzle wasn‚Äôt loose at all, but still somehow leaked.

I think this product has potential. Just needs a few tweaks. But as of right now, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it at all for my fellow combo/oily people."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,This is not it at all,This was the worst product I‚Äôve tried. It‚Äôs not a fine mist spray and the formula leaves your skin feeling sticky and super shiny. Definitely returning this.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,disappointed,I love the Supergoop Glow sunscreen and was excited to try this. Sadly this is a substandard product that sprays sticky and clumpy and makes my eyes sting. Used it twice in a seven hour period and had to stop and buy eye drops.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,Sprays unevenly - areas of my hair and chest would get wet while parts of my face wouldn't. Sprays very hard in some areas and not at all in others. Strong scent and leaves everything greasy
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,Pass! This product is so GREASY and SO OILY!! I looked like a glazed donut under the sun!! if you have oily skin this is a pass!
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Worth a Try!,"I recommend buying the smaller version and when you finish that size buy the larger size to refill it. The 1oz version has a WAY BETTER nozzle that sprays more consistently and works with the way they advise you to spray your face in a circular motion. The 3.4oz is a great value but the 1oz packaging works better ESPECIALLY if you plan to use this over makeup and worry about it ruining it. 

Personally I like this sunscreen and on a hot day the scent is refreshing and cooling and I don‚Äôt even like rosemary. I‚Äôm on Tretinoin and it doesn‚Äôt sting my skin or leave it irritated. And it doesn‚Äôt leave you looking ghostly or casket ready!
Lastly, this doesn‚Äôt sting my eyes but it does taste weird. So hold your breath and tuck your lips in when applying like they state on the packaging!"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,the first one i bought had a broken sprayer so i had to bring it back the next day.  the smell is kinda minty and if it gets in your month it‚Äôs not very fun.  it doesn‚Äôt burn your eyes as long as you keep them closed until your face feels dry.  this product is super handy to keep in a bag to re-apply sunscreen every two hours.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"So I have mixed feelings about this spray. I used it on top of Too Faced Born this Way make up with my base being the supergoop unseen sunscreen. Didn't get any burns which was great, but almost every time I used it my eyes stung a bit after."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"Terrible product! Greasy, pump it terrible and worst of all it makes your eyes burn!! Probably the only bad product in their line"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Disappointed,I was really looking forward for this! The product it self is alright but the packaging is horrible :( it leaks every time I use it and the sprayer is always inconsistent.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"Very, very greasy. I loved the idea of being able to spray my face for a SPF touch up‚Ä¶ but with the amount that you need to apply for proper sun protection it‚Äôs not able to absorb into the skin. I prefer a stick to reapply."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Eh,Not sure if I got a bad batch but the nozzle doesn‚Äôt spray very well. It‚Äôs more like a squirt than a spray. It also stings my forehead. Won‚Äôt be repurchasing due to the sensitivity of my skin.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,"Love it, but have to leave it","As much as I LOVE this product, I can‚Äôt get over the money I‚Äôve lost because every. single. time. the pump malfunctions. Because I loved the formulation so much, for years I‚Äôve repurchased hoping that supergoop would fix this issue, especially since it seems to be fairly common, but I‚Äôve been disappointed each time. 
Another sunscreen brand finally came out with a similar product and that pump has been working like a dream."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Try anything else- NOT worth it.,"I was so excited by the concept, could not have been more let down. Not only was it an intense stream even holding the bottle as far away as I could, but it was outrageously greasy. I didn't think I'd gotten it in my hair, but it looked like I hadn't washed my hair in days (right after a shower). I tried setting it with powder anyway, just to see, even though it's supposed to BE a setting product. Well, even with powder, my face turned into a complete grease ball after as little as two hours mostly indoors. My face makeup was completely sliding around on my face, and when I tried to gently blot away some of the intense grease, it just came completely off. I don't understand how they call it a ""setting"" mist- for me it acted more like a makeup remover. I really don't understand how it has so many positive reviews, because I can't imagine this product working well for anyone. I have seen some comments/reviews saying that people having issues should shake it more, but I shook the bottle vigorously for at least 10 seconds. I really feel like I gave this product more than enough chance at success and it still majorly disappointed."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,Good concept but I expected it to mist onto my face and it just squirted so I had to rub it in. Was hoping to be able to use it over my makeup mid-day.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,"It‚Äôs sunscreen. But, it could be better imo","The pump is the WORST. So, I don‚Äôt like sunscreen. Who does? I don‚Äôt want my skin to be greasy or shiny. However, a mist is an easy way to apply. But, this pump is TERRIBLE. It‚Äôs not really a mist, it‚Äôs more like a spray. Which does NOT apply evenly. I immediately poured the contents of this bottle into my urban decay setting spray and that was much better. It also kinda stings when applied, but switching the bottle helped. And it does kinda leaves a greasy ‚Äúglow‚Äù and it feels greasy too. It‚Äôs not that bad. I just wish they could improve the formula and the sprayer nozzle for sure is sub-par."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,good minus the pump,"i don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with the spray part of the nozzle/pump but looking past that, i think this is a great product. i unscrew the cap off and use this to refill the mini size since the nozzle/pump spray is way better and sprays more even"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"I like the ease of this product because I often forget to reapply sunscreen, or I can't due to my makeup.  It's also nice to spritz on if I'm running out for an errand and want some protection.  The scent isn't too bad and fades away in my opinion fairly quickly if you're concerned.  I also don't mind the scent--peppermint and eucalyptus. I would recommend lightly pressing the product into your face after spraying to help with absorption."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,"Stings, bad spray nozzle and bad consistency.","Terrible. Sprays in a wide circle with fat droplets. So misses my whole face, so I have to rub it in anyway. It smells strong and stings a bit. When a showered after being in the sun, my eyes stung immensely. It's not a good product at all."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Pass on this,Packaging is terrible--ended up with more product on my hands than on my face. Stings a bit on face and smells a bit.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,It‚Äôs just alright‚Ä¶,It wasn‚Äôt bad but wasn‚Äôt great either. I don‚Äôt like that the spray doesn‚Äôt go on evenly‚Ä¶it‚Äôs like a mix between droplets and mist. I used a mini fan to dry down after application. The smell was minty and refreshing.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Oil not setting spray,Very confused about this? It‚Äôs marketed as a setting spray but is actually straight oil which is the opposite of setting. Definitely returning.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Oily & Ruins Makeup,"TERRIBLE!! Very oily and the spray disperses so weirdly, does not cover your whole face yet gets sprayed on clothes and hair very easily. AND!! It is NOT a setting spray, my makeup stays on so well before, after I spay this is all downhill, my mascara gets on my eyelid, my eyeliner gets smudged. I HATE this so much."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,definitely not worth it.,So bought this. Was super excited about it because it‚Äôs a setting spray and spf. Yay. Always need sunscreen on the face. Got it in yesterday. So used it this morning. Omfg. It sucks majorly. First of all this stuff STINKS. can‚Äôt put my finger on what it smells like but it‚Äôs all I can smell. And it‚Äôs supposed to be a matte finish. Guess what it‚Äôs not‚Ä¶. A matte finish. My face looks like I just rubbed oil on it. And I put my normal matte setting spray on over it. It got all over the place so it‚Äôs on my shoulder and arm. Those feel super greasy and gross. I‚Äôm so annoyed. For the price I was expecting a lot better. Hopefully I can return this garbage.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"I‚Äôm consistently underwhelmed by supergoop products. They feel literally goopy, very greasy and heavy. This spray is oily. It doesn‚Äôt disperse evenly when sprayed so the coverage isn‚Äôt even. By the end of the day my face felt granular from the powders clumping together. Great potential and idea, but overall awful texture."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,So so,"I liked the concept of this product. The spray is good. However, I found it to be too greasy and heavy on my skin. The smell is not as offensive as the stinging on the eyes."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,Super oily. I spray the product on my forehead but it also got sprayed all over my hair which made it look like I haven‚Äôt showered for days. The pump doesn‚Äôt even spray evenly.. The product stayed oily the whole day and it didn‚Äôt feel like a mist at all.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,I would give this zero if I could. The spray doesn‚Äôt work correctly- I had to exchange it but even the replacement broke. Not worth it.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Beware!! Very Oily,"I followed the instructions and shook the bottle very well. Sprayed a couple times and it went everywhere. Strong smell and even after waiting the 3 seconds that it says in the instructions, it burned my eyes. It‚Äôs so oily and it left spots on my shirt so that I had to change, as well as all over my bathroom counter. All throughout the day, I kept feeling my face and it never dried down. I was an oily mess. Returning this asap."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,it works as a refreshing SPF spray.,"I liked it more than I thought I would based off the reviews. The market is still so small for this type of product but I am determined to reapply my SPF as the sun only is getting more intense this summer so I picked it up. The scent is a bit shocking in its intensity and isn‚Äôt really necessary in my opinion, but the sunscreen works well as a refreshing spray. It‚Äôs not the finest most in the world but frankly I didn‚Äôt expect it to be. I want to be able to throw this in my purse and roam about town, and give myself a quick touch up on the sunscreen and refresh my skin. I think this accomplishes that. I will say I would not rely on this as a way to extend your makeup- for me, it made my skin extra dewy and my makeup never seemed to dry back down. I definitely would transfer. For an oily girl like myself that‚Äôs a new feeling since I rely on powder so much‚Ä¶ I might this on the go with a powder puff afterward and see if it affects the over-dewiness. That being said it did not make my makeup melt or come off, and it actually did refresh it nicely. No white spots like others have complained. It‚Äôs nice and undetectable!"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Sadly disappointed,"I wanted to like this because I wanted to combine spf with a setting spray. one less product right? first, the spray is not even. Everyone has experienced a misting spray bottle that becomes a squirtgun to the face... this kinda behaved that way straight out of the box. This is obviously an issue with packaging. Additionally it is VERY oily. I don't even want to spray it on my face when i have clothes on cuz it will leave oil marks/spots on your clothing. And be careful, cuz after i used this the first time, i almost slipped on my bathroom floor. Any spray that gets on the floor is like coating your floor in oil. I will not be buying again. I DO recommend the standard sephora setting spray. I guess I'll have to find an additional SPF spray to use ontop of THAT."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,decent but only if you aren‚Äôt oily,"If you have oily skin this is not for you. I was in love with the concept but it ended up making me look super shiny and oily. I can‚Äôt speak for other skin types but if you‚Äôre oily, it‚Äôs going to make matters like worse. Smell also a little strong. However SPF seemed to work fine. SuperGoop please make a matte version for us oily ladies!!!!!"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,so easy!,Easy to use sunscreen that‚Äôs perfect to set your makeup or apply on the go!
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,I love Supergoop products and i wanted to love this so badly because I NEED a spray spf to use over my makeup mid-day. I could live with the leaky bottle but when i use it on 5-hour old makeup it makes it pill like crazy!!!! That‚Äôs just unacceptable!! Looking for something else if anyone has any recos!!
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,I tried a different brand prior and it made me look really greasy. I tried this one and it works great for me. It doesn‚Äôt make me look greasy. It just feels like a regular setting spray for me.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,This product actually wasn‚Äôt as oily as I was anticipating. I was great to just spray on and go. But for the love of‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt open your eyes. I see some people complain about it stinging your eyes. Simple solution there folks!
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,The bad reviews are dramatic,"The bad reviews on this item are dramatic. It‚Äôs literally spray in sunscreen and works that way. I wore it over makeup and it melted down perfectly. I think perhaps it doesn‚Äôt play well with some products. 

For reference I had put on daytime skin care earlier in the day. It included the fresh deep hydration toner,  real complexion‚Äôs hyaluron skin essence, a very light layer byroe‚Äôs fog renewal oil and murad‚Äôs oil and pore control mattifier sunscreen. This was all over 2 hours before I put on my makeup hence the need for the reapplication of sun screen. 

I was definitely a bit more dewy in complexion after applying but I experienced no separation, the smell was very mild, and I waited until it dries to no burning eyes. I will definitely be purchasing this product for as long as they make it. Being able to apply sunscreen over my make changes the game."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"You have to shake it before you spray it.  When you do that, liquid leaks from the sprayer top.  I mean A LOT leaks out.  I've been rubbing the extra on the backs of my hands but I feel like it's wasted product and now the bottle is slippery and my hands are slippery."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,No instructions - how do they get away with that?,"I think it's okay, but wow....there were NO instructions. How are we supposed to use this stuff? We're talking sun damage on faces. SuperGoop failed on this one."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,"Great idea, bad execution","I needed to figure out a waterproof make up routine for the summer. That wasn't the hard part as a lot of brands do that, but I noticed my face didn't have that healthy glow when I was using all the waterproof stuff. I decided to add this in order to 1) really set my make up as I do water sports and 2) give my face more radiance. While the idea is great -- a water proof setting spray that has SPF, the execution was lacking. These are my two main complaints:
1) The bottle leaks. It's not a torrent, but liquid does seep out so that the whole thing becomes oily and hard to handle. Not to mention it wastes.
2) The sprayer is not fine enough. The liquids comes out in small droplets instead of a fine mist. It lands on my face and leaves tiny shiny dots all over. 
I would buy this again if I can figure out how to put it in a better bottle, but I will be looking for a different one in the meantime."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,I liked the application but did not like the oily texture nor the chemical smell of it and it made my hair greasy if it got to it
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"The spray nozzle is horrible, not a fine mist. It goes on super oily and totally smudges my mascara and doesn‚Äôt sit well under mask. I‚Äôll still use it just not over make up. Not worth it."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,DO NOT GET THIS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.,"This product is horrible. Do not believe those reviews that say ""incentivized"", they are lying! I can't believe this product has 4 stars. 
It's extremely oily, i sprayed it and obviously pushed my hair back and yet, the tiny drops i got on my hair made my hair so oily that i had to wear a hat i had in my car.
My face was legit dripping oil, the spray is too thick (not a mist) so you get drops that when touched feel like pure oil sitting on your face. 
Take make it worse, the bottle was dripping into my purse and made a big mess."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,Liked that this was light weight and long lasting. Used while hiking and didn‚Äôt have to reapply for 2 hours. A bit more expensive than what I would normally use as a daily cream unless I was regularly outside.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,Bought this last minute for a trip to Europe once I noticed the forecast was going to be extra sunny. I wanted something travel size and quick and easy to reapply between site seeing and country hopping. This product ticked those boxes. The application could use some work. The spray nozzle requires a bit too much pressure to get a decent spray but the mist itself is fine. I found the smell to be quite offensively strong/almost chemically but it does fade and is an issue for all of 5 seconds. On my face the product felt a tad bit greasy but I‚Äôve experienced worse. I do feel that it did a good job setting my makeup. After full days of touring and power walking in 70-80 degree weather my makeup did not shift. I was able to do some evening touch ups right on top of my existing face and head out for the night. Overall I rate this highly in comparison to what is currently available on the market for facial spf sprays and will continue to use it.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"Seeing a lot of negative reviews talking about how it gets in your eyes or how it doesn‚Äôt spray evenly, but the directions say to spray in your hands and pat into your face (like any sunscreen). You should never be spraying sunscreen directly onto your face because of course it will get in your eyes and be uneven. When used correctly this product is great and perfect for reapplying on top of makeup."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,love!!!!,so convenient and lightweight and smells great!!! definitely buying again
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Strong scent BUT it works!,"Works great! You really do have to shake it vigorously before spraying so that it is a fine mist. The bottle does say it‚Äôs a light hint of rosemary and mint but it is VERY strong. Highly recommend following the directions of not opening your eyes for 3 seconds after and try to not breathe in for 5 seconds because it is straight up mint in your nose! 

The product doesn‚Äôt move my makeup or make me look oily (I have combo skin). Happy to be able to apply sunscreen over my makeup!"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"I read the description and was really excited to try this product. However, I was disappointed. It‚Äôs extremely greasy and does NOT set your makeup. It has a pure oily texture and looks like a straight up oil on your face. Not to mention almost unbearably potent smell."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,I just started using this product and I'm definitely not disappointed! It's very light weight and the smell is very mild.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,"It‚Äôs good, but the spray isn‚Äôt too good","I enjoyed the product itself, especially in thinking I can reapply my sunscreen with a spray when I have a full face of makeup on. But what was terrible is that the spray itself wasn‚Äôt well made, and when I used it, my eyes burned a lot. And it also had a chemical smell that was not enjoyable. But I do love the mint smell!"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"I was hesitant to try this based on other reviews but I love it! I was worried it wouldn't be a mist, but it does provide a nice mist that dries well. The scent is very mild, pleasant and fresh."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,The smell is too strong!!,"I love the concept but the smell omgg I can‚Äôt breathe when I put it on. Even if I spray it on my hands and then apply to my face. The smell is sooo strong. I had to return. 
I have dry skin and it did make my face look a little Greasy but I don‚Äôt mind it. 
If they make it again without the strong smell, I‚Äôd def buy."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"I was so excited for this product. A resetting spray with spf that could be easily reapplied over makeup throughout the day. My dream come true? NOPE. This is so oily, and it NEVER dries. It does the opposite of setting your makeup. Any touch to your face would wipe your makeup off because of this. Makes you feel greasy (I have dry skin, and never knew what that felt like before using this product). 

The other issue is the smell. Before reading the ingredients for rosemary and mint, I thought it smelled like bug spray. The rosemary is overpowering and if you get this in your eyes it burns. I honestly don‚Äôt know how this product got released."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"I got this product complimentary from Supergoop!
It‚Äôs a good concept but I wish the mist was a little more fine. It doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs applying evenly and I ended up getting a few droplets on my face which was annoying when the whole point was to reset my makeup. That being said, I would probably purchase this if it came in a travel size as it would be handy to have in my purse."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"I wish I could give this 0stars. As an esthetician I‚Äôm willing to give any spf a try especially one as easy to apply as this, however‚Ä¶ this is the absolute worst! Firstly, why on earth would you put spearmint in a facial mist/spray?! It actually burned more than getting sand in my eyes.. Secondly, if this is supposed to be a makeup resetting spray why is there SO MUCH OIL?! Literally completely melted my makeup off after applying 2 layers which seems like to me it defeats the purpose. And lastly again, why the mint? A HUGE NO FOR ME, PLEASE REFORMULATE!!!!"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Favorite,Supergoop gifted me this gorgeous products. It's so lightweight. Absorbed quickly. Never irritated my eyes . Very convenient for travel. You can use it any where any time. It's became one of my favorite supergoop products. They always amazed me  .
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,my favorite impulse buy,"I bought this product on a whim and I gotta say, the negative reviews don't make sense to me. This product is great! It does not mess up my makeup and it doesn't smell like chemicals to me. If anything it's slightly minty. It is good for on the go! The sprayer isn't a problem if u hold it far enough away from your face. Ofc some product will be lost but that goes for any and all sprayable products. That is the price you pay for convenience!"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Not For Me :/,"Unfortunately, this product did not work out for me as a setting spray. The Supergoop ReSetting Spray was sent to my complimentary from Supergoop. I used it after applying most of my makeup, but before mascara. Then I went and applied my favorite mascara combo. Within minutes, my mascara had smudged all over my cheeks and under eyes. I will still try this product when I‚Äôm not wearing any makeup at all, but this will not work as a setting spray over makeup for me!"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Too heavy for oily skin,"I really wanted to like this spray. I used it over my makeup and all it did was turn it into a greasy mess. Even by itself, it's still really greasy. I have oily skin to begin with and was hoping it would give me a glow."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this sunscreen. The concept is self is so emerging I‚Äôve been looking for for a really long time. After using it your makeup stays intact which was really important for me. I would recommend this to pick up for summer makeup or no makeup days.
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Great Spray,I really like this spray! It's lightweight and not sticky like regular sunscreens that you would apply on your face. I have been using this with the Unseen Sunscreen. It's the perfect pair! It's extremely refreshing! ***I received this product complimentary from Supergoop.***
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"Gifted by Supergoop. I wanted this for the days I wear makeup and want to reapply spf.

The nozzle didn‚Äôt get clogged and the mist sprays evenly.

I didn‚Äôt experience any irritation around my eyes either and it didn‚Äôt disrupt my makeup either.  This works well!"
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"This needs to be shaken up to work best, a lot of people are complaining because of not shaking it I think. While I don‚Äôt hate it I probably won‚Äôt use it in the summer often because of my super oily skin. I‚Äôd recommend for dry to normal skin. 
Gifted by Supergoop but opinions are my own."
SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Supergoop! (Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40 - 30ml,"This product was gifted by Supergoop and I was very excited to try it.

SUPERGOOP!-(Re)setting Refreshing Mist SPF 40,USA,Perfect!,"A total game changer! This product was gifted by Supergoop. Yet, I will be repurchasing b cause it is so good. Perfect for reapplying on the go! I live in Florida so this has become my new best friend. The mist feels so refreshing and does not leave any white cast. No need what so ever to reapply your makeup. Definitely a winner!"
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Stick SPF 50,Malaysia,Great sunscreen ,"this is super good sunscreen because its 100% mineral, it suitable for pregnancy women, but its quite pricy for small stick and it leaves u white cast but im all good as long as the ingredient is good and safe to use im happy with it!

SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Stick SPF 50,Singapore,does the job but not easy to apply,I bought this as I was looking for a cheaper sunscreen option. I use Unseen regularly but I cannot afford it all the time so I bought this. It basically like a chalk after application where you have to spend time rubbing in for a while and that was the most infuriating part of it.
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Stick SPF 50,Malaysia,great mineral sunscreen ,Absolutely love it.. Easy to apply.. Has the right percentage of zinc oxide.. One of the best physical sunscreen.. Only downside is its quite expensive for such a small size.. Best to get during sale..

SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Stick SPF 50,Singapore,Smaller than expected ,"product is great. but since it was my first time buying this brand, i did not expect the stick to be THAT small, even though i am aware that the volume is already that little. it is the size of my palm. since there is no white cast, no slimy feel i think it is considerably ok for the price.

SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Stick SPF 50,Singapore,ms,Very small sun stick compare to other Brands. A little bit oily for my skin. Still have to blend it with fingers onto skin if not will look patchy white.
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Stick SPF 50,Malaysia,Stick SPF,Convenient and easy to apply! It does not give a greasy feeling on the face but applying directly on the face with makeup might not be very hygienic. 
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Stick SPF 50,Singapore,would not repurchase :(,"Very sticky sunscreen. Not sure if its because its 100% mineral or what but the formula feels sticky. Not a huge fan of the scent either, somewhat vanilla scented? 
High spf and waterproof though. "

SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Stick SPF 50,Malaysia,good sunscreen ,I like that it comes in a stick form. it gets the job done and leaves a very beautiful glow. the only downside is that it leaves a white cast even when you really blend it in. no funny smell and lasts long time. just wish it didnt leave a cast. 
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Stick SPF 50,Singapore,kinda sticky,"helped my friend to get this and being a bit oily skin, she mentioned that it‚Äôs kinda sticky. but it‚Äôs easy to apply and not much mess. just have to set it with powder"

But I find I don‚Äôt really reach for this as much since face sunscreens just feel kind of heavy on my face and look kind of shiny"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Highly recommended,"This is my favorite sunscreen. I have been using this for almost two years, and ever since I found it, I have been repurchasing this sunscreen. It has a little bit of smell, but it's good"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,The morning must-have!,"This is the only sunscreen that doesn‚Äôt break me out, rubs in nicely, and doesn‚Äôt leave a film. I have very acne-prone skin. I use it daily and it lasts me at least six months (I stock up at VIB sales). It‚Äôs good to mix in with my foundation on mornings where I‚Äôm running late."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,wonderful!,"I can‚Äôt understand not liking this. I‚Äôve used this for over a year. I tried to stop buying it because it‚Äôs expensive. I‚Äôve tried other sunscreens and I‚Äôm convinced this is just the best. I have sensitive skin and this doesn‚Äôt bother me- no matter if I go in a pool or the ocean or sweat a lot. Also- it‚Äôs VERY effective at sun protection. I told my boyfriend this weekend that I should have taken a picture of him as proof of this sunscreens effectiveness. He put normal sunscreen on his body and this tatcha sunscreen on his face. His face is so much lighter than his body! All to say, this sunscreen is so great and I‚Äôm so thankful for it!"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Amazing !,This is the best sunscreen I‚Äôve ever tried. It‚Äôs my absolute favorite! It‚Äôs clean and it helps minimize my pores. It feels amazing on my face with no white cast. It‚Äôs expensive but so worth it to me. Definitely a HolyGrail
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,So greasy smells awful.,"I cannot believe this has such high reviews, this leaves my skin so greasy it‚Äôs unbelievable cannot wear make up over it."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Amazing!,My all time favorite sunscreen! Mainly because it‚Äôs the only one my skin can tolerate !
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,My favourite spf,"Really good stuff! Applies nicely, white cast is not obvious! Just a tad expensive for spf

TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Not Holy Grail,"Twice I was sent an already expired tube; third exchange was the charm. It‚Äôs an ok product. There are better sunscreens at better price points I prefer, like many of the Elta MD sunscreens."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Not good under makeup,"I really wanted to love this, it goes great with my oily skin. Good for no makeup days. Sadly when I wear it with makeup it makes my foundation crack and separate. I wear the Est√©e Lauder double wear stay in place foundation and I‚Äôve never had my foundation crack with any other products I‚Äôve used under it in the 11 years I‚Äôve been using it."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,"The scent is pleasant. Consistency is nice and creamy, but it does leave residue and I've found that it can pill under makeup. 
For me, the EltaMD UV Clear facial sunscreen with niacinamides perfected my pores better and for half the price."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,I am temped to stock up so I never run out!,"Most amazing skin care product I have ever used.  I have large pores and very sensitive skin to the point if not being able to wear any sunscreen on my face without my eyes burning horribly as the day goes on.  This causes no irritation at all, leaves my pores almost non existent, makes my make up stay on all day long and does not have any odor or chalky film.  It is a miracle and I hope they never stop making it like the pearl eye cream that was my other favorite beauty product of all time."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,don‚Äôt let the price scare you!,"Don‚Äôt get frightened by the price! This is by far the best face sunscreen that I have tried on the market (I‚Äôve tried over 20+). It does exactly what it claims, feels great on the skin,+ makes your skin look smoother. It‚Äôs 2 OZ when most moisturizers are 1 Oz and I use this as my AM moisturizer over my serum. Highly recommend!"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,"If you are Kelly Rowland skin-tone, this will definitely leave you looking blue. The only good thing is that it‚Äôs definitely oily-skin friendly."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,"This is a good sunscreen, but the price point stinks and it‚Äôs not always in stock. I‚Äôve swapped brands due to these concerns."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,sunscreen,"really wanted to love this product after hearing so many reviews. sadly however, it didn't work out well for me. i believe i might be sensitive to an ingredient as my skin would go red and itchy once applied."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Love it,"I really love this product. It was recommended to me  in conjunction with another skin care line and I have been to happy with the weight,feel and coverage. Not greasy. I wear most days in stead of foundation"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Best SPF moisturizer,"I honestly love everything about this product. It is very thick, but a little goes a long way. Your face will feel buttery smooth after applying. I use it under makeup and it helps my skin look smooth and hydrated."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Meh and expensive,"After one use, I'm back on the hunt for an everyday sunscreen. It drys too thick for my liking especially based on how much SPF should be used for adequate coverage. For the price, I don't feel like it is that great and am debating forcing myself to use the remainder of the tube."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,"For how often one should reapply sunscreen, the price is HIGH, but this is one of my favorite US-filter sunscreens. I do prefer Korea, AUS, and EU sunscreens where they have more approved filters, but the texture of this one is amazing. Not overly matte but gives a nice smoothing effect which is great alone or under makeup."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Amazing sunscreen that softens your skin,"This product is wonderful. It makes my skin soft and smooth, and it does not make my skin feel oily. I wear it alone and under makeup. It has a very light scent that is faintly citrusy, but is hardly noticeable. My only complaint is that it is only SPF35, as I prefer a higher coverage. I am a huge fan of Tatcha products and highly recommend the Water Cream as well. I have combination skin, but my T-zone needs blotting several times a day."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,Ms,"Cons: I don‚Äôt see much difference to my pores. There‚Äôs a very strong orange smell which I don‚Äôt like. This is the reason I‚Äôm deducting its stars and not repurchasing. 
Pros: Doesn‚Äôt cause breakout. Doesn‚Äôt become oily under makeup. Rather matte feel upon application "
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,TEH BEST SPF,"I am just loving this SPF, it is light. It is soft skin. It en-lights my skin ."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,No oily appearance,"This is an amazing sunscreen I don't know why so many negative feedbacks. Little goes a long way, you just need a pea size amount. The scent is not as strong as some mentioned, it has a sunscreen scent but is very mild. I love that it does not leave a greasy appearance like other products. I am glad I give it a try.  Strongly recomend."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Pills under foundation,No matter what foundation i wear over this it always breaks apart and pills. It has a sunscreen scent to it when you first apply which isn‚Äôt masked by the ‚Äúsilk‚Äù scent. Will not repurchase.
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Favorite sunscreen,Best sunscreen for my sensitive skin. It only pills if you don‚Äôt spread it over your skins as soon as you squeeze it out of the tube within 3 minutes or so. Otherwise it does dry out so try not to leave clumps on your face. It leaves my skin matte like a primer. I love that. There‚Äôs a fine pearly sparkle to it that I don‚Äôt mind at all.
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Will sell out in 3‚Ä¶2..‚è≥,"Daily sunscreen use is essential for my overall skin health. At minimum it contributes to 50-80% of my facial aging. It‚Äôs extremely important for me to select a moisturizing sunscreen that works well with my skin type, which for quite awhile, trial and error was the name of the game for me until I purchase. . .

‚Ä¶ My review is a complete honest and unbiased product review. I Just enjoy spreading good vibes, passing as much info about a great product that can benefit many."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Favorite!,This is my absolute favorite sunscreen for under makeup. Doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast or pill. Makeup stays put all day. Would love if the price was cheaper but I‚Äôve wasted money trying others- this is the best and worth it.
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,"It‚Äôs okay, for me","It‚Äôs a nice sunscreen, but left my face looking dull. After using it for a few days, I realized it pills up like CRAZY."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,Best,Best sunscreen ever. It's so silky and applies so smoothly. Does not leave any white streaks and it even works well as a primer before applying make up. I have used other sunscreens which causes my skill to pill whenever I apply make up after but this one does not at all. It is perfect. 
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Feels so amazing on my skin!,"I‚Äôve been through many sunscreens that unfortunately just could not work well with my skin, dr. Jarts, innisfree, Ren, isntree, shisedo, etc. But, this one however feels so effortless when I put it on my skin and I never feel like I need to use a lot to feel covered. I really love the feeling this sunscreen gives me, almost like silk. Plus, my skin can look oily from time to time and this sunscreen gives me an amazing matte finish that looks healthy and not pasty looking. I was hesitant about the price, but I can now tell why it‚Äôs on the pricier side with just how wonderful it feels. Absolutely fell in love with this sunscreen! First time writing a review on a skincare product, this product amazed me."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Favorite sunscreen,"Lovely silky texture, leaves pores looking smaller immediately and isn‚Äôt oily at all. Perfect way to start a natural look for the day"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Pills like crazy!!!!,"Wanted to love this but it‚Äôs literally unusable. This SPF pilled worse than anything I‚Äôve EVER tried in my life. Not only is this annoying and strange to look at, but it also means you‚Äôre not getting the full protection of the SPF!! SPF35 is not that high to begin with so definitely don‚Äôt use this without some other form of sun protection. 
I‚Äôve read that the pilling can happen if you use water-based products underneath and that oil-based products would combine with it better - tried that as well and it made a slight difference but there is was still noticeable pilling. And as soon as I tried to layer on any makeup, we were back to square one with the whole thing pilling right back off. 
2 stars are only because if you do manage to get it on and get it to stay by some miracle, it does definitely fill and blur pores, but words out on whether or not that‚Äôs really the best thing for your skin."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,The only sunscreen I have bought over and over,It is rare for me to repurchase the same sunscreen. But I am loyal to this one.  It is just beautiful.  It is pricey but I love using it. Highly recommend.
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,10 out of 10 i highly recommend this sunscreen it‚Äôs the only sunscreen I enjoy it‚Äôs thick but makes my skin look and feel so amazing fills in pores. I hope this never gets discontinued I tried supergoop and it was trash made me break out soo bad never trying anything new again
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,amazing!,Very moisturizing! Feels heavy on application but soaks in really well. Great coverage and no white cast on my medium-light skin
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,one of the best sunscreen,It blurs the pores and does its work as a sun block. One of my must purchase in my vanity list. Fragrance free which is so important as a sunblock! Tatcha is really good in making their products in my opinion. 
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,"This does what it says it will. It definitely mattifies a bit, and blurs or minimizes my pores, and it doesn‚Äôt pill. I use it with the tatcha water cream and it‚Äôs a fantastic combination."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,worth the money if you can afford it.,"It‚Äôs worth the money. I am thrilled with it. It doesn't leave a white cast, and it keeps the shine away from my oily skin."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,HOLY GRAIL SUNSCREEN,"This is my favorite sunscreen ever!!! I have seen so many new products in the market now that I wanted to try, but always end up picking up this product. It doesn't clog my pores! Love love love!"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,best sunscreen,This is the best sunscreen I have ever used. No gross smell or separation and actually minimizes my pores
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,Awesome product!,"I bought this many times! It‚Äôs so great and I would use it under my Givenchy Libre Loose Powder. Love it so much!!! That I recommended it to my cousin. I believe this entry was triggered because I made the purchase on my cousin‚Äôs behalf.
"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,My favorite sunscreen,I love how creamy and silky this sunscreen is. It really does blur the appearance of my pores and I love how it primes my skin before applying makeup. Worth the price!
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Not satified after one month's of use.,"At first, I thought this was the best sunscreen with a luxury texture and non-shiny finish. But after a month of daily use, I found three main problems- 1. It's not sweat approve or water-resisstant, if you move and sweat, it will melt away. 2. It pills or doesn't absorb well of 80% of the skincare products. If I want to keep using my favorite serum or moisturizer, this spf won't work with them. 3. I got sunburn even after I apply a generous amount. Maybe the spf is on the lower end and I'm in sunny California, anyway, I got sunburn twice when using this product. So now I dare only to use it when I work at home. And because of the high price, I won't buy it again due to those reasons. Test it yourself, don't be fooled or so thrilled at the first time when you apply it! It will seem and smell amazing initially.."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,It‚Äôs Sunscreen,Too much scent for my sensitive skin. Nice texture though. Wish it would work for me but my skin is combo and sensitive and the formula irritates it.
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,NOTHING ELSE COMPARES,"Best SPF I have ever used. It has a slight ‚Äúsunscreen-y‚Äù smell that I‚Äôve seen some complain about, but I absolutely love it. Wears perfectly under makeup and over any other serums or moisturizers. Also one of the few physical sunscreens that isn‚Äôt tinted and doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast. It is more than I‚Äôm comfortable paying for a small tube, but I tend to just buy it anyway because it is the best part of my morning routine!"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,"Love it. If you‚Äôre someone who doesn‚Äôt like to wear foundation or BB cream, this should be your choice. Texture is excellent. Didn‚Äôt irritate my sensitive skin."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,"This is the perfect sunscreen for oily skin!! It wears nearly perfect under makeup. My only complaint is that for the price, the product should be bigger."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Figured out how to stop it from pilling,"I was almost going to return this because the first few times I used it I experienced a lot of pilling on certain areas of the face. But I also noticed that on the areas it didn't pill, I had the best of both worlds -- gentle zinc SPF protection and a bit of radiance. I also really liked how makeup applies so smoothly over this sunscreen, because some zinc sunscreens can leave a chalky feel that makes foundation look too pale. Not so with this one!

Anyway, because the instructions on the product recommend layering it over a moisturizer, and because it's the dead of winter and I have drier skin, I needed to figure out what would work well with this. Turns out that a few drops of a face oil applied first work out great! No pilling at all, not even a tiny bit. I'm so pleased. Previously I was using an oil-based moisturizer that didn't even have silicones in it, but for whatever reason the Tatcha didn't agree with it. If you like face oils, I highly recommend using one underneath this SPF."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,Expected more for the price paid,"Upon application, the product spreads very easily but it smells slightly chemical and unpleasant. It doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast but because my skin is oily, at the end of the day, white patches of sunscreen can be spotted on my face upon a closer look. Given the expensive price tag, I expected more from this product. Overall, while application is smooth, the utility of the product does not justify its price."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,been buying over 5 years,I buy this twice every year and have been buying it for over 5 years. I wish it came in a bigger tube. Doesn‚Äôt leave a white cask and instantly give a youthful iridescent look. Play well under water based makeup and easy to apply. I hate spending the money but haven‚Äôt found a better sun screen.
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,I prefer to use this in combination with tatcha‚Äôs primer compared to supergoop all in one (which I find greasy)
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,This is one of the best SPF I have ever used. I have very sensitive skin and this works perfectly for me.
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Best Sunscreen for Oily Skin,"This sunscreen is amazing! It makes my oily skin poreless with no shine and actually blurs my fine lines on my forehead. I love that it has that beautiful Tatcha smell, no white cast, and and you only need a tiny amount for your whole face, so it lasts forever. My face looks so much better without makeup now."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Great for Oily Skin and Brown Complexions,Love IT. Best Japanese ingredients I've ever used. I've tried the face wash and water cream moisturizer and all feel so gentle and clean. Each product performs as it is suppose to. I wished they sold a larger size in this.
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,caused break outs,"It‚Äôs heavier/thicker than I thought it would be, and it did break me out. It also feels kind of oily. Everyone seems to be saying the opposite so I‚Äôm not sure if I just got a bad batch or something! I stopped using it on my face and started using the rest as a body sunscreen and it does just fine for that. It even has the slightest bit of shimmer in it that makes your skin look nice and glowy. It‚Äôs pretty expensive to use as a body sunscreen so I probably won‚Äôt re-purchase one I run out."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,"I have oily skin. And this works perfectly. It really is silky smooth, absorbs, no white residue left over. It sits amazingly under makeup. It doesn‚Äôt clog my pores. And I actually look forward to rubbing it on my face each morning."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Amazing Product,amazing Sunscreen. I di=ont get irritate bt this. my skin is very sensitive to all the other sunscreen.
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,I adore this sunscreen. The scent is nice and my skin looks so good after application.
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Matte Sunscreen,I have combination skin. This makes my t-zone look waaay less oily throughout the day. So glad I finally splurged and purchased. The only downfall is it has a sunscreen smell. I wear it as a moisturizer and still put on primer after if I wear makeup.
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,"Light, all day‚ú® zero residue ‚ú®","If you want light and dry, get this. I have tried allll the sunscreens from high-end brands to the latest more affordable conconctions and really do think this is the best for daily use, pairing with whatever moisturizer, in humid climates especially as it has no residue, but is just light. It is effective and built into my daily routine unless I use Supergoop‚Äôs Glow Screen for a bit of radiance. This was also my first foray into the brand but want to sample their preventative products as well. Also, I can‚Äôt tell if pore reduction happens but I know it doesn‚Äôt clog my pores!"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,discontinued?,love this product but i‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs not available in store or online‚Ä¶ is this being discontinued?
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Favorite Sunscreen!,"This sunscreen is amazing if you have dry skin! I experienced pilling when I first used it, but I realized the products you use before make a difference. I noticed when I use a hydrating toner, my serums, and a moisturizer, then this on top it soaks in really nice and I don't experience any pilling. You just have to make sure to actually work it into your skin so it doesn't pill. I am about to purchase my second bottle! (also goes great under makeup)"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,"liked it, but not enough to repurchase","I like tatcha products as most of it had worked well for me, this one does it job too.

pros: it doubles as a primer, make up layer on nicely without getting cakey. for normal to combination skin, the texture of this sunscreen is rich enough that you can get away applying this without a moisturizer 

cons: it's pricey and I wished it has higher SPF"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Pilling Issue,"I‚Äôve used multiple tubes of this and recently I‚Äôve been having the worst issue with pilling. With no change in my skin or skincare, it could be a bad batch. Love the classic Tatcha smell and it goes on smoothly, but the pilling is a huge issue under makeup or without."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,"It might protect you from the sun and there‚Äôs no white cast, hence the 1 star. 
I‚Äôm pretty sensitive to the heaviness of sunscreen, especially on my face and I do not prefer the tactile sensation of applying this one. It continues to feel heavy, just like when you first apply it, long after it sinks into the skin. 
Initially, it smelled really nice (I like sunscreen smell) which was why I kept trying to wear it even though it doesn‚Äôt really smooth pores nor does makeup look very nice over top. 
If you‚Äôre not going to use this up within 12 months, please be prepared to throw it out because it does definitely ‚Äúrot‚Äù/turn sour due to the plant extracts in it and will eventually smell like mildewed roses."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,The smell doesn‚Äôt fade & skin looks‚Ä¶ normal.,"As I‚Äôm sure that it does what it‚Äôs supposed to do (protect the skin from sun exposure) this is one of the most fragrant sunscreens I own, and I have quiteee a few. I don‚Äôt think the skin benefits are enough to counteract the zinc-oxide smell and price point. Unfortunately, I‚Äôll be returning this."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,I hate that I love it,"I hate that I love it. Usually a lot of sunscreens break me out and sting my eyes. I tried this at a friends house and instantly loved it. I have dry and dull skin, this gave me radiance and a gorgeous glow. It filled my pores which makes me look like I‚Äôm wearing a tinted moisturizer on no make up days and if I do wear make up it sits well under! There is a slight white cast, but I spend about a minute rubbing it in and the white cast is all gone. It hasn‚Äôt broken me out, and although it gives me that primer/ filled pore look, I don‚Äôt feel like my pores are clogged at the end of the day. I don‚Äôt have more blackheads because of it which I love! My complain is the hefty price with the small amount of product and small Spf % I wish they can come out with another that is am spf 50. I bought this with the sephora sale, I think I will wait to repurchase until the next sale in the fall to better justify the amount/ price. Overall I do love this product! and it‚Äôs definitely worth a shot! I just don‚Äôt love the amount of product and Spf for the price"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,love it,"Was really skeptical at first.. but best decision i have ever made. Looks so nice on the skin
Love it will definitely buy again"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Love Tatcha,My favorite sunscreen hands down! Works great for oily skin and under makeup. My makeup never looks oily with this sunscreen under.
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,Nice,It is a nice sunscreen. But would prefer higher SPF. Finishing is matt but not so dry and cover pores to some extent. Quite expensive so will not buy again.
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,Gave it a shot,"Facial profile: Dry and sensitive skin, pores around the tip of the nose and under my chin. It works pretty well preventing sunburn however because of the thick consistency, my skin was not able to absorb well and I had some break outs on the forehead and cheeks. I have to emphasize that all skins are different. Probably yours may absorb and react well to this, mine unfortunately didn't. Definitely not for me."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Broke me out,Super sad this didn‚Äôt work out for me. I usually love Tatcha products. Made me break out and greasy.
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,"Goes on very smoothly, with the silky feel. However it does pill later and hard to put makeup over it which causes it to look cakey."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,Great everyday sunscreen and doubles as primer!,Love this for everyday wear and it is good as a base for make up too! Fills in pores nicely
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,"A smooth sunscreen that does well under makeup, although it can clog pores."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,I found the One!,"I finally found a good matte SPF moisturizer!!! Y‚Äôall this is it. I‚Äôve tried so many. This one is great! I haven‚Äôt had any issues with it at all. FYI, I apply by dabbing, I don‚Äôt rub it in, that may make a difference!"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Just no,"I was really disappointed by this primer, especially after all the hype in the reviews. It goes on nicely and seems to blend, but within an hour it is settled into my pores and tiny lines I didn't even know I had. Makes my foundation look cakey, and my face feel dirty. I'm going back to the Paula's Choice SPF primer, even if it's not a clean beauty item. Keeps my makeup on even in the heat, and my face looks great."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,meh...,"Just for quick reference, I have extremely sensitive skin that leans more towards the drier side but my T-zone can get a tad bit oily by the end of the day. I do love the way this sunscreen makes my pores look, it seems to fill everything in and give me a smooth appearance, HOWEVER, it leaves a strong white cast on my extremely pale skin, I have to mix my Drunk Elephant D-Bronzi drops to make it work. You have to be careful with the amount you use because if you use too much it will pill like crazy, it‚Äôs definitely not the best option underneath makeup because it can be a bit finnicky. I like it on no makeup days but I‚Äôve noticed a lot more milia showing up on my chin ever since I started using this so I think with all the trouble I‚Äôve gone through not to mention the high price of this spf, I‚Äôll just be finishing this bottle and moving onto another spf."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Very expensive but good quality,"Oh, how I wish this sunscreen wasn't so expensive.  Following the instructions preciously, and placing over my moisturizer as the final step before adding primer, I've had absolutely no pilling or white cast.  It's lovely to wear.  Thick formula melts into the skin quickly and probably could be used as a primer if you really wanted.  Does it blur or make it looks like pour size is reduced?  No.  I at least like knowing I have sunscreen on my skin.  Will I purchase a second bottle?  The price is what will probably prevent me from purchasing again."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,"This for sure creates a kind of blur that makes your skin look amazing -- but I've found it really pills and doesn't work at all as a base for makeup. I'm definitely going to finish up the tube for no-makeup days, but for the price, I was expecting a bit more."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,"I got a sample of this sunscreen so I decided to buy the full size and I‚Äôm not sure why I did that lol at first I thought wow no cast and it just applies beautifully on my skin but now that I have used it multiple times and have used the recommended amount of sunscreen by dermatologists, I noticed that this pills SO much. If you‚Äôre using a tiny dollop then you‚Äôll be fine but if you‚Äôre using the correct amount of sunscreen then you will see this pill up and just rub around your face, it‚Äôs so bad and so disappointing because the price is outrageous. I‚Äôm gonna use it on days that aren‚Äôt sunny and stay home so I don‚Äôt apply too much and avoid the pilling."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,LOVEEEE!,I love this product!!!!! its amazing I've been using it for about a year now. it smells amazing! it blends in really well doesn't leave a white cast!!! I 100% recommend it!!
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,"Overpriced sunscreen. It does nothing for my pores. On the plus side, it‚Äôs a nice feeling sunscreen and it does protect my skin."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,"It's thick, effective, and pricey","I'm on a mission to fade the sun spots I have and prevent new ones from forming. I can apply this sunscreen multiple times a day on my face and neck with no white cast. It's very moisturizing and I feel protected from the sun. I didn't want to like this product as much as I do because of the price tag, but I have to say that it's worth every penny."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN/NO POINT IN BEING ROGUE,"After taking out of the box and opening a brand new tube of Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen, the entire product flew out the back of the tube and on to all of my clothes. The product was not squished in my bag and was taken right out of the box it came in. Customer Service will not send a new one and treats customers who gain status and spend hard earned money like they mean nothing"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Pretty packaging,"Feels good on the skin, you can tell after applying how blurred the skin looks. Not a typical white cast it's kind of a blue hue on my complexion after a bit but becomes more transparent with time. I use it everyday and have had no reactions acne-wise. Overall really nice but expensive!"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,pills like crazy,"I am now towards the end of this tube and am so disappointed. The pilling is just so frustrating. With makeup, without makeup, it pills. And for this price, I am not buying again. The stars I do give are because this does double as a primer and it doesn‚Äôt leave much of a white cast. Also, i hav become more educated on ingredients since buying this‚Ä¶and will now be looking for mineral sunscreen only."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,Non greasy texture. No irritation. Leaves skin smooth and moisturized.
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,"Love the product, price is obviously crazy","I have dry, fair skin, am in my early 30s. My skin doesn't usually react to products by breaking out, but I am sensitive and can get rashes really easily. That being said, I love this sunscreen. If I'm in a rush and know I won't be in the sun all day, I can get away with putting this on with some mascara and I am good. It doesn't leave a white cast (that I can tell), and it goes on more like a primer. Under makeup it's a really nice base, but don't put too much on or else it WILL pill, like others have said. Minus one star for the crazy price."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,best product I‚Äôve ever bought,"This sunscreen is the best product I‚Äôve bought in my lifetime. I usually never write reviews but this product exceeded all expectations and was truly a pleasant surprise. I have oily and acne prone skin. When I put this on, I barely have oil production from my face and it has significantly made my skin look and feel better. This product gives you a blurring effect on its own and goes SO well under makeup. I‚Äôd rather use this than my regular primer under makeup. 100% worth the money."
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Worth the price,"This is simply the best sunscreen there is! I stopped using it for a while to try to find a cheaper sunscreen... But ended up coming right back to this product. It doesn't leave a white cast (at least on my skin tone), and it sinks right in and creates a beautiful finish. I work outside and live in the desert, and while using this product I never burned or even tanned on my face. I tried and failed to find better!"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,Excellent Sunxreen,"Love this!  It feels very light going on, no shine, no breakouts.  Normally I don't like fragranced products but I like the light fragrance - it reminds me of summer.  Only drawbacks:  I wish it was all mineral"
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,one of the best sunscreen!,Love this product. I used most products from Tatcha and this is one of my favorites. I don‚Äôt leave home without it. It makes my skin feel good. It does not feel like a sunscreen
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,USA,really good!,This is a good sunscreen! I haven‚Äôt had it pill at all. I use tatcha skin care and it works well with all their products. I do not have an issue with it under makeup and it doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast but I make sure to rub it in well with my hands.
TATCHA-Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 35 PA+++,Singapore,love this! ,"Love how the make up stays when I applied this. 
It leaves the face very light weight & set the make up better. Not oily. Love it. 
Will purchase again.


Thank you "
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer Refill,Malaysia,Good,"My daughters love this to the bits!! It has SPF and it is also a day moisturizer, non-greasy and no white cast. Suitable for problematic skin too. For extra SPF protection, just double the sundcreen!"
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer Refill,Singapore,repurchase,"This is the second time im buying this product because I love it!!! Besides the price point of course hahaha smells great, is a great base and protects you from the sun what more can you ask for"
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer Refill,Singapore,Good but not great,"Had a few repeat buys with this one. Love the consistency when applying & it‚Äôs a 2-in-1 product. Saves time.

Cons: A tad too sticky for me. Wished SPF was higher."
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer Refill,Malaysia,ms,This moisturizer is the best ! Cause there is spf in it and moisturizer so it is an easy to go product to use ! And price wise is pretty affordable ‚Ä¶ by the way you can just purchase the refill and it does dispense out 
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer Refill,Malaysia,Sustainable,"Love this for 2 reasons: The product itself is really good- Makes your skin extra glowy and dewy which I love, and the second reason is that it is sustainable. Beauty buyers go through many containers all year round and it feels good to know Fenty is trying to reduce our plastic consumption. "
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer Refill,Singapore,the best sunscreen ever ,"It does not clogged. And I love the smells too.Moisturiser my skin and blend well with my power. 2nd purchase. My husband use it and he change to fenty. 

"
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer Refill,Malaysia,Does the job!,Love this moisturizer! initially got the mini set and loved it so I got the full size. but if I'm not mistaken there's an spf difference for the mini and original size. It has a fragrance which is fine with me but people who prefer moisturizers without fragrance may not like it. This moisturizer does the job and keeps my face hydrated all day. The full size (50ml) lasted me 2.5 months   
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer Refill,Singapore,Good everyday moisturiser ,"For me, this moisturiser is good enough for everyday wear. I'm too lazy to wear a separate sunscreen so this moisturiser is perfect cos it has SPF in it. It smells great and it absorbs very quickly into the skin. The reason why I gave 4 stars is because I wish it came in a bigger bottle cos of the price. I have gone 2 bottles of this and I think I will keep repurchasing it. "
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer Refill,Singapore,THE BEST SUNSCREEN + MOISTURIZER,"Talk about the best ‚Äî I mean the BEST SUNCSCREEN EVER!!!! I tried a lot of sunscreen, moisturizer and this is the best among all!!! Soft on the skin and also works magic when you prep your skin before you put your make up on. Soooooo good"
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer Refill,Singapore,Too oily on my skin,Not great for my skin. Creates an oily appearance and is causing me to have breakouts. Perhaps this is more apt for drier skin and not an oiler skin like mine.
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer Refill,Malaysia,the best moisturiser for combo skin,"This refill stuff is gem. Either almost sold out or sold out whenever I wanted to restock (every 5 months or so-money saver!) it's not too greasy, great n fast absorbance, with spf! Also not making my face oily + prepped up for a makeup just by using this? Oh yes, riri did a good job on this one. also, why waste money to buy new packaging when you can just refill and recycle or make use of the bottle for creative things? "
FENTY SKIN-Hydra Vizor Invisible Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen Moisturizer Refill,Singapore,second bottle,Love this! It smells great and feels light on my skin. Great that it has built in SPF too so I can save on my sun screen. Great for stay at home days. 
SUPERGOOP!-Play 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 50 PA++++,Philippines,Too thick,"It did the job of not getting me sunburned but the consistency of the product is too thick. The packaging was ok, but the consistency and the size of the hole made it hard for me to squeeze out the product. "
SUPERGOOP!-Play 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 50 PA++++,Malaysia,Not my go to sunscreen lotion,The liquid consistency is too thick and quite difficult to apply it evenly. It also has a unique smell which i don't favor.  Most probably will not repeat 
SUPERGOOP!-Play 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,Supergoop‚Äôs Super Good!,"Really like this SPF! It‚Äôs nice, lightweight, doesn‚Äôt run down your face when you spray it, compact and portable and does it‚Äôs job wonderfully. Easily 5/5"
SUPERGOOP!-Play 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,average,Dont really like the white cast effect on me especially that im brown skin. I would prefer supergood everyday lotion instead! The texture is thick and oily on skin
SUPERGOOP!-Play 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,great ! ,"Still has a slight white cast on Chinese skin. But it is waaay better than the previous formulation - grippy texture, easily absorbable, nicer scent = enjoyable application."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Zinc Sheer Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 PA +++,Singapore,nice combination of moisturiser and sunscreen,Product feels smooth on the skin. It gets absorbed quite easily and does not leave a white cast. It‚Äôs does feel slightly sticky after application but goes away after a while. Just add on with light powder and it does not feel sticky anymore 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Zinc Sheer Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 PA +++,Singapore,Dont buy,Stupidest sunscreen to ever exist. Lives ur face super gressy and very oily. It makes u look like u didn‚Äôt washed ur face in the morning. It gives u that look that is just not it
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Zinc Sheer Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 PA +++,Malaysia,Best mineral sunscreen (so far),"I am so happy to have found this as I have purchased so many mineral sunscreens over the years. This one by Biossance does not leave too much of a shine (which mineral sunscreens tends to do) and also does not leave an uncomfortably sticky feeling on my skin. My skin did not get burnt when out swimming at the pool for a couple of hours. So, all good for me! Whilst I will always be on the look out for a better mineral sunscreen, for now, I am thrilled to have found this one. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Zinc Sheer Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 PA +++,Malaysia,it works in dry skin!,"It‚Äôs suitable for dry skin and user friendly for pregnant women. The product is really luscious and thick without irritating the skin. Wish they come in a bigger bottle though
"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Zinc Sheer Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 PA +++,Singapore,Nice !,"In search of the mineral sunscreen which doesn‚Äôt give a whitecast, stumbled upon this after hearing so many good reviews. Though it doesn‚Äôt leave noticeable whitecast which I am happy about, it leaves a greasy finish. With repplications, face becomes greasy ball.. Hope the brand come up with matte version of this sunscreen "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + Zinc Sheer Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 PA +++,Singapore,best sunscreen ever! ,The best sunscreen without leaving a cast! & its fragrance-free! Love this ever since i purchased it at sephora us! Pls make this permanently in your store! 
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,smells bad,"I usually love supergoop products and absolutely love my unseen and am willing to pay the price for good sunscreen. 3 stars because it feels great on, a little goes a long way and I like the texture but it smells pretty bad and the smell lasts. I think it‚Äôs meant to be an un scented kind of scent so it doesn‚Äôt have a perfumey smell but it kind of smells like chemicals."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,I like it,I was looking for a product that combines spf and moisturizer and I picked this one. The smell is not very good but it absorbs well into the face and is good for makeup
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,1 star,"This product smells terrible to me. It doesn‚Äôt offer my dry skin any moisturizing benefits. Overall, I‚Äôm not impressed and don‚Äôt recommend."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Great daily moisturizer!,"Absolutely love this for my morning routine. One of the few products that doesn‚Äôt break me out, too! Only reason I‚Äôm not giving it 5 starts is because the un scented smell is weird (hate) and the container is so annoying. Wish it was in a squeeze tube so badly. isisannoying."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,best but too pricey! ,"I love these moisturiser, this is my 3rd purchase but its way to pricey!!! I will only buy it when its on sale or there is a discount. As i said best but just expensive! "
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not for oily or combo skin.,"It did give a moisturized feel, but would make me look more than that. I'd have to blot every other hour. Maybe a moisturizer to use during winter? 
Smell did not linger, so that was a plus."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,"It's a good product but not for oily or combo skin. There is no scent, thanks goodness and it does leave my skin feeling super hydrated but shinning like a disco ball. The consistency is a but odd, like a cross between a cream & a jelly but it rubs in easily. Good product for those with dry skin."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,It stinks!!!!,I wanted to like this product but I couldn‚Äôt get past the awful smell it couldn‚Äôt stand it and the moisturizer is ok. It‚Äôs a little pricey for not enough product. Not my favorite from supergoop!
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Love it,"second purchased!. Truly easy to apply.
Keep hydrate and not waste your morning rush time...
"
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Yes Yes Yes!,FAVORITE moisturizer of all time!!! This definitely keeps my dry skin moist and most important is a sun screen! Love that this is a two in 1 instead of putting two different products on my face for moisturizer and sunscreen especially since I live in the desert! Also gives a little glow as well.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,excellent for dry sensitive skin (retinol users),"My new favorite spf. I just wish it were a 50 but I haven‚Äôt had any sunburn so 40 must get the job done. I have skin prone to dryness. I‚Äôve used Prescription Tretinoin for many years now and it has that affect. I love that this sunscreen replaced any moisturizer I had to use for day so it lightens the load and amount of products I had to use. It‚Äôs a light layer that packs a punch with continuous hydration. Now I use a serum (Lauder Advanced Night Repair, and eye serum, an eye moisturizer and then this on top. It is perfect and I hope they never stop making it. I don‚Äôt need primers under makeup if I wear it. It moisturizes and keeps my skin feeling comfortable all day. Have not have any issues with breakouts. The scent is light and reminds me of soft honey. It dissipates quickly and I never notice again once I‚Äôve applied. It‚Äôs gentle enough that I‚Äôve had zero issues with it stinging or burning my eyes. Now that I think about it I haven‚Äôt had any burning when I rub my eyes. I don‚Äôt know that this would be ideal for anyone with normal or normal to combo and oily skin. Maybe in the winter for normal. But if you have truly dry skin ( mine is also sensitive and prone to redness) this is the one. For my neck and chest I use Super Goop Play. It‚Äôs a 50 SPF and is working out great. I also use that one on shoulders and arms as needed. Love this line."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,best ,"Best sunscreen ever, I love the quality and texture it gives to my dry skin. And it does not cause my skin to be too oily as well. A lot of product, good purchase "
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Bad smell, greasy texture.",It smells like it expired long time ago. Unbelievably awful smell. Too greasy.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,My secret weapon :),"I just repurchased for the fourth or fifth time so I'd say it's time to give this product a five-star review. When I first started using it, I had about a week of adjustment where my skin was slightly dried out but then it was all golden from there. I get so many compliments on my skin now and it is mainly thanks to this ultra-glowy sunscreen. Probably not suitable for oily skin, but my dry/combo skin adores it. Works great under all kinds of makeup. I have tried the Supergoop invisible sunscreen but much prefer the consistency and feel of this product personally... love her and appreciate her :)"
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Best sunscreen,Multiple time user of this product. Absolutely love it. I have sensitive skin-- especially to creams and oils of any kind and I love this sunscreen. It is protective and high quality. Leaves a good finish-- not too matte and not oily. Have been using this product for a couple years now. Plus I like that it has 'blue light' protection.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,I love this product. I use it every morning since I bought it. It gives a nice shine that makes my face look awake. Great for people who are just starting to use sunscreen
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,NOT a sunscreen,Works as a moisturizer but NOT as sunscreen. You will get burnt!!
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,"This probably would have worked better if I had drier skin. It made my skin feel oily and I noticed it would pill if I had anything underneath it. Not the worst I‚Äôve tried, and I‚Äôll definitely finish it so I can get my moneys worth, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be repurchasing."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,Worth it! Hey i didn‚Äôt realize the glow screen is a primer!!!
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Amazing,"holy cow. this is my new holy grail. i can‚Äôt get over it! my skin is SO dry normally and it flakes constantly. adding this to my morning has worked wonders for my dry skin. it feels so good, doesn‚Äôt pill with primer and makeup (i use the milk gel primer and nars light reflecting foundation) and then if it‚Äôs too glowy of a finish for me i will also use the supergoop translucent powder and that‚Äôs a great product too. definitely give this a try"
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,This is definitely my new favorite sunscreen! I tried the unseen sunscreen by supergoop before this and it wasn‚Äôt the fav because I have dry skin. But this is great and is great under makeup.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Perfect moisturizer/sunscreen combo,"I was a little worried reading the reviews that this would be heavy on my skin during the spring and summer months. A little goes a long way, so I‚Äôm wondering if others were putting too much on. It feels great, and is non greasy. Just give it a minute and it soaks into your skin."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Love,"I‚Äôm on my 3rd jar of this stuff. I use tretinoin so I need hydration and also sun protection. I live in Florida so I‚Äôm exposed even driving my car. This is a very hydrating cream so if you want something lighter, it‚Äôs not for you. It can appear greasy at first but my skin drinks it up after a few minutes. I use it under my primer and foundation and it doesn‚Äôt pill. Performs like a regular moisturizer only with the benefit of spf."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,"While I like this product, the packaging feels like so much plastic. I wish it weren't so bulky and excessive."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,I love supergoop but this moisturizer just didn‚Äôt cut it. Made me break out and the scent was awful.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,"went to buy sunscreen for my oily skin and the beauty advisor suggested this. I used it twice and returned it. it's sooo heavy!! I looked greasy and none of my makeup would stay in place, even after allowing it to ""dry"" for a good 10 minutes. I've tried other supergoop products and as far as I can tell they are 100 percent not made for my skin type."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Amazing!,I love this moisturizer! I‚Äôve recently started using tretinoin in my skincare routine and it requires lots of spf and hydration and this moisturizer delivers! It can leave your skin looking a bit shiny or greasy but I just dab it a little with a napkin and I‚Äôm good to go! I would recommend this for dry skin.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,This is by far one of my favorite parts to my skincare routine. Leaves a nice dewy/refreshing afterglow. It's a must.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,"No white cast. It doesn‚Äôt peel. It‚Äôs not moisturizing without being oily. I have very sensitive, dry skin and this went on my skin so smoothly without irritating it. Definitely going to buy this again."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Such a Great Moisturizer,"This is the perfect daytime moisturizer! It has SPF, it‚Äôs very moisturizing and it‚Äôs not fragrance-heavy. I don‚Äôt use any other moisturizer during the day and I never will!"
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,best,"Bought for my mom as her birthday present. I would say it fits my mom‚Äôs skin. No breakout, oh ya ma mom is 50++. Bought this so that my mom can apply whenever she wants at home specifically (in the morning, cooking n stuff) A bit pricey for such a small product but its okay worth to try.üëçüëçüëçüëç"
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,hydration!,I love this so much. I first got a sample to try out. I was able to use the sample for 3 days. A little goes a long way. So that‚Äôs the first thing I liked about this. I have very very dry skin and I‚Äôm 41. I have never seen my make up look better. My fine lines are almost non existent under foundation now. My crows feel look so much better. My foundation ever cakes. I‚Äôm obsessed. All while getting spf. My face doesn‚Äôt feel tight anymore by the end of the day. I‚Äôm so happy I tied this. I already put another in my cart to have on hand.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,LOVE SUPERGOOP! SUNSCREENS,"This product specifically, I bought for my father as he is always in the sun at the beach and is an avid sunscreen wearer. He also has VERY dry skin and I really wanted to help him with his dry skin. and because he already uses sunscreen everyday this product was very easily integrated into his daily routine and now his skin in moisturized and protected! He tells me that he LOVES it! He says he wants more of the product from now on for holidays and gifts lol His skin has really gotten better too, it was very flakey and dry before and now he is moisturized with no flakes! He is very pleased with this product and I will continue to buy it for him. 

On a side note, I love any product from SUPERGOOP! I have been using their basic sunscreen for years to protect my tattoos from the fl sun. It is the only product of sunscreen that does not make me feel greasy, or look cloudy, or smell like sunscreen. It absorbs right into my screen, doesn't get on my clothes, and feels light! I won't use anything else. 

Thanks SUPERGOOP!"
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,I wear this every day. The formula is so smooth and refreshing.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Great for dry, sensitive skin","I use this every morning as my base face product. I use a retinoid nightly, so I have to be proactive about sun protection and using products that won't further irritate my skin, and this one is perfect. May be a bit too oily for those with oily/combination skin, but is perfect if you have dry patches."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Doesn‚Äôt break me out!,"I have had such a hard time finding a sunscreen that doesn‚Äôt break me out. I‚Äôm 24 and with very pale, sensitive skin and this stuff works great for me. The smell is not strong and goes away after 20 mins, plus it doesn‚Äôt make me overly shiny!"
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,You only need the tiniest amount to cover your entire face! I learned the hard way. This is perfect under your makeup! It doesn‚Äôt have a harsh sunscreen smell either. Super comfortable on the skin or on top of another regular moisturizer!
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,so so only,Not sure about the level of protection but at least this item doesnt make my skin dry or white line. As light texture as moisturiser. For the sunscreen i feel it will be much more choices out there. Anyway it‚Äôs a good try. And denfinitely wont repurchase
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,"This is my favorite skin care product! I've rebought it 5 or 6 times now. Ever since I started using it, I get so many compliments on my skin. My only complaint is the container. I wish it came in a pump or squeeze bottle. It would make it SO much easier to use."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,No thank you,"Really wanted to love this, as I like the idea of it being a moisturizer and sunscreen in one with anti pollution and other benefits. I have combo sensitive acne prone skin, every time I use this I notice an extra little bump form on my skin by the end of the day and my skin seems to experience more redness compared when I use other sunscreens. Like others I  can‚Äôt stand the smell. For the price there are definitely much better sunscreen options. Tried to make this work for 1/3 of the tub, but will use remainder on the body."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,"I wanted very much to love this product. I have very dry skin and I wanted to consolidate my SPF with intense moisture for ease. And this does technically do that, but I find the smell so off putting, even after application. It smells weirdly earthy to me - like rubbing natural clay or straight up mud all over my face. But worse, because I generally like the wet earth sort of smell. 

Supergoop! is definitely one of my favorite brands for SPF, but this ain‚Äôt it for me."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,I purchased this moisturizer after I started tretinoin and it so good. It‚Äôs super moisturizing and looks great underneath makeup. Also a little goes a long way so it‚Äôs definitely worth the splurge.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Not very outstanding,"I really wanted to like this. After trying the tester, I was impressed with the product and finish. however after some time of using it, the product separated in the tub."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,"I bought this with hopes to use it in the summer, but the moisturizer is way too thick, even for SPF standards. I only swatched it on the back of my hand but immediately disliked it. Maybe it'll work better for someone with severely dry skin."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Makes face itch,This makes my face feel very itchy. I am going to return.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,"Liked the primer but thought I could use more moisture with SPF.  Turns my skin red upon application and seems to highlight my imperfections.
Returning!  Too bad as I hate to return so I think the company should reinstate samples."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,not my favorite,Smells awful. Too thick. Not as sheer as I wanted.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Nice, but looking for something better","I've been using this daily moisturizer for about five months now. I have oily/combo skin which tends to be drier in the winter months. That being said, it's a little too moisturizing when temps go over 40-degrees, and I can feel it on my face. The first couple of weeks, I did get a little bit of texture on my face, but some of it went away once my skin got used to this product. There is a slight floral/fresh scent that does dissapate once it begins absorbing, and it's not greasy at all, which I appreciate. I do wish there was a smaller tub available, and as I know I won't be able to use it in the spring and summer months, I worry about the SPF expiring sooner than I can finish the product. Oh, I also use a little cosmetic spatula to scoop a baby pea-size amount. Overall, I am content with this daily SPF, but have mixed feelings about repurchasing."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,OBSESSED,"- Does NOT leave a greasy residue on your face
- Smells really good for a sunscreen product
- Light, fluffy moisturizer that soaks right in

I will absolutely be buying this again. Meets all my criteria for SPF *and* is an excellent moisturizer!! 

Love love love. The newest staple in my skincare routine!"
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Smell a little unpleasant ,"I actually enjoy using this on it's own however the initial smell of it is quite unpleasant. It does go away after some time but it's something I would consider before buying again. It's not as greasy and doesn't clog my pores. I have oily and sensitive skin, it works well for me besides the scent. I have purchased and used many types of SPF in the past as well as now, this brand is by far the best I've tried. It's really expensive though but as long it works well on my skin, I'd be willing to repurchase. Just can't get over the scent. :("
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,This is my go to moisturizer. Leaves my skin feeling so hydrated and saves me from sun exposure. I got my boy friend and brother using this too. I can‚Äôt even count how many times I‚Äôve repurchased this !
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,"I wanted to love this. The glow screen is too dark on my fair skin, the vitamin C one makes me look greasy, and this formula seemed to be the winner but it pills on my skin like a worn out sweater. If you plan to put literally anything else on your face besides this- it‚Äôs a no go."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Not for humid weather ,While the product itself is great - luminous and rich. I found it melting my makeup as soon as I stepped out of the aircond room. I used it up on my hands. Will not be repurchasing 
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,It was love at first site then‚Ä¶.,I wanted to love this so bad! Supergoop is one of my favorite and most trusted brands. Worked great for the first few days. Perfect amount of moisture for winter but my face started breaking out in rash/ bumps after about 4-5 days and now I have the worst texture all over my face! Sadly I will have to return.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,Philippines,must buy,"I have tried many sunscreens, but this one is definitely one of the top in my list. It's thick but not sticky in the face once applied. I feel my skin is protected and moisturize. (somehow shortened my skin prep for the day). it has a faint smell but not too bothering."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,have been using this product for years. Definitely a must have
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not for Oily or Combo Skin,"Skip if you have combo or greasy skin. By the time you put on enough to have adequate sun protection, you will look very greasy. Also, this has an unpleasant smell. The only positive for me was that it didn‚Äôt leave a white cast. I ended up using this on my hands to use up the container, but I will not be buying this again."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,It‚Äôs very moisturizing and easy to blend and pairs perfectly with other products. My only con is the strong sunscreen smell but otherwise I really like it!
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Avoid if you have oily skin!,"Not good under makeup, or for oily acne prone skin. I have very sensitive skin and it never broke me out but It made me super oily. My foundation would slip and slide and my skin looked terrible. The sunscreen would never sink into my skin and it definitely does not feel like it‚Äôs lightweight."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,in love!,"I purchased this sunscreen in hopes of finding a good daily moisturizer with spf for my extremely dry skin. I ended up absolutely falling in love with this product. 

It has a pudding-like consistency in the jar, which is interesting and slightly cooling on the skin. A very little goes a long way, leaving the skin looking dewy and refreshed in the mornings. 

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this product to someone with dry skin. It‚Äôs really moisturizing and can leave those with already oily skin looking greasy."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,"this was too greasy for my liking, don't recommend"
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not as good as unseen,"I bought this because I love this brands unseen sunscreen. It‚Äôs still very high quality, moisturizing sunscreen. I just prefer the unseen as it gives me that dewy look. I still prefer this to other sun screens I‚Äôve used but I‚Äôm a true fave of unseen!"
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,AMAZING,I have only been using this product for 2 days now and WOW!! I am IN LOVE! There is absolutely no white cast and it looks amazing under my makeup! I am personally not a fan of any primers so I was nervous as to how my makeup would sit on top of this and I don‚Äôt think my makeup has ever went on as good as it did until now! I am obsessed and will never go without this product!!
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Dry, reactive skin friendly!","My skin gets really dry in winter and I was looking for a moisturizer with SPF- voila! I'm allergic to a lot of things and my skin is very reactive but this hasn't bothered me at all- it feels great, creamy, and hydrating and not at all greasy. It has a faint scent, I'm guessing it's from the ingredients, I find it pleasant."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,Great daily moisturizer with sunscreen; goes on colorless
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Youthful Glow,This product is now a staple in my beauty routine. It give such a youthful glow while protecting the skin! Love it!
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Best SPF out there,"My new favorite AM product! It‚Äôs been so hard to find a moisturizer/sunscreen combo that works well with my other skincare products. This doubles as a lotion with SPF and isn‚Äôt greasy, doesn‚Äôt make your face sting like some sunscreens‚Ä¶it just feels like lotion. It‚Äôs unscented and won‚Äôt make serums or other products pill underneath it. It‚Äôs very creamy and makes your face feel super soft, I love it!!"
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,I really like this moisturizer for the day time. It‚Äôs a great base for makeup. I would say it‚Äôs better for the dryer girlies because it does feel a little bit oily but not in a bad way. I personally like that cus I have dry skin. I also like how light weight it is and how it doesn‚Äôt burn my eyes! So many spfs burn my eyes when some gets into them. I‚Äôll use this alone or sometimes this as a base then Paula‚Äôs SPF after.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,not for oily peeps but good anyways,Definitely not for oily people but it does moisturize very well and is a great base for matte foundations.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Please create for dif skin types,Supergoop if you're listening please create this sunscreen for different skin types. I absolutely love how moisturizing it is but it leaves my skin way to oily.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,The product is actually really great!! Their moisturizer and spf is a dream!! The only reason o gave it 3 star is bc the smell is super strong and over powering. It‚Äôs weird bc I  have the other spf products from this brand and none of them smell except this one.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,"Obsessed! I‚Äôve tried a few moisturizing sunscreens and they never feel hydrating enough, especially living in a dry climate. This has become my new holy grail! Leaves me feeling very hydrated and glowing!"
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,My daily Moisturizer/SPF,"Great daily SPF moisturizer. I bought this to simplify my AM routine since it‚Äôs an SPF and moisturizer in one. It works great - and I actually like it better than a lot of other moisturizers that I‚Äôve used. It blends really well. A bit oily‚Äî but it works so well on my drier skin and leaves a nice healthy glow. I like that it doesn‚Äôt really have a smell like other sunscreens. And it soaks in we‚Äôll, so easy to put makeup over. I use this daily and will definitely be repurchasing."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Great for a dude,"I get this for my husband!!!!! It has no smell, easy to apply, and keeps him protected. It's a bit pricey but he remembers to use it so that's all that matters!"
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,High price for what it is. Left my skin VERY greasy looking and caused me to breakout.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Go-to Sunscreen under Makeup!,"If I know I‚Äôm gonna be wearing makeup, this would be the only sunscreen that I would use. I find it difficult to pair sunscreen with makeup because I‚Äôve had my foundation ruined especially with sunscreen that dries down and caused my foundation to apply unevenly which in turn causes patchiness."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Swimming Pool in a Tub,"The smell is too overpowering for me. The texture gets clumpy in the tub, kinda like a yogurt. If you can overcome the smell, it is a good all-in-one day moisturiser."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Do not like the smell,The very first thing I noticed opening the container was the smell. I tried to ignore the smell and try it on. The product is very sticky and does not absorb well. The smell of the product was worse when I put it on my face. I had to wash it off immediately.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,great product,"I‚Äôm a guy and I‚Äôm on my second container of the product, I‚Äôve tried a few diffrent moisturizers and this one is one of the best out there especially if you work in the sun or outside it keeps your face moisturized"
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,just ok...funny smell,"The other supergoop products like are much better, this one is a little thicker which is nice for dryer days but has a funny smell & does not absorb as well as the others."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"if you have dry skin in the upcoming season, try!",Bought this because I get dry skin in the winter and oily skin in the summer. But since winter is approaching I went in to get pointed in the direction of new skincare. At first use I felt moisturized. Not too heavy but you can feel your skin feeling fresh as well. So far so good!
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,Greasy and stings my eyes. I like the unseen screen and Matte screen but not this. Also had too much fragrance
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,amazing,"This is a life saver if you struggle with dry patches or other sunscreen products pilling. I have combo skin and this takes care of my dryness issue without all the pilling other products do. I can be oily in my t zone towards the end of the day, but not always. I just use a blotting paper and I‚Äôm good to go. I wish the container had a pump. Like the pump that drunk elephant uses for their peptide moisturizers? That way I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm contaminating the product with my fingers whenever I use it."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,"Felt like the price was mainly for the packaging, not much product inside. As for the lotion itself, it was ok. I love the glow bar so I thought this would be good. Had a funny smell. Did it‚Äôs job and I didn‚Äôt burn too bad‚Ä¶it would help to know that anything below spf 70 I burn crispy within the first hour. Skin did feel nice but didn‚Äôt need to be so expensive."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Very very good!,So nice and light yet very moisturizering. I really love it. Perfect for my dry skin! Leaves a slight sheen but no white cast which is great!
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,This is ok.  I will use it but not sure if I will repurchase.  Does not feel great on my skin.  It‚Äôs pretty heavy and after a while of running errands sometimes I have to go into a bathroom somewhere and wash it off because it‚Äôs starting to sting my eyes.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Great SPF,A great daily sunscreen moisturizer that gave me the perfect spf coverage.Wish that it was a bigger container for the price.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Nice moisturizer but not for me!,"Sadly this product didn‚Äôt workout for me. I have sensitive/acne prone skin and it caused me to breakout like I was a teenager again, it made my eyes burn a bit and my skin felt kinda puffy as if I put a mild lip plumper all over my face. Definitely stay away from this product if you have sensitive skin or research the ingredients first to make sure it‚Äôs right for you! I would only recommend this product to normal skin, but you should probably try a sample before buying the full size."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Burns Eyes,"I want to rate it higher because it kept my skin nice and safe from the sun. Why only 3 is because anytime I would sweat or if it was just hot, it would run into my eyes and sting (not the greatest when driving) I probably will be trying another brand because unfortunately burning eyes is a deal breaker."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Strong Chemical Smell,This has a very weird jelly like greasy texture and an intense chemical smell. It also did not help with improving my skin at all. I switched to a different daily sunscreen moisturizer that used mineral UV filters instead and had other benefits. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this one.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,I really wanted to like this product but every time I wear it i look so shiny (I have oily skin) I think it‚Äôll be great for dry/normal skin that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving it 3/5 stars
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Great starter sunscreen,Skin felt moisturized with each use. Small enough for travel so it makes it easy to re-apply throughout the day. As a POC I was worried about a possible white cast but their isn‚Äôt one.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,not for oily combination skin,"Its an okay product i tried it because one of the girls
Suggested that it was for combo skin but  i don‚Äôt think it is because it made my skin oilier than whAt normally is so this is a no for me :/"
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Plumping,Love this moisturizer SPF combo! It soaks deep into my skin and keeps me hydrated throughout the day. Best of all there is no white cast which is an issue I get with a lot of SPF lotions. Has been very kind to my acne prone skin.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,In Love,I love this moisturizer so much that I even returned my Tacha Dewy Skin For this 2in1 sunscreen moisturizer. It gives such a hydrating glow I was extremely impressed. I have normal borderline dry skin and anything hydrating I put on my skin usually just soaks it up and doesn‚Äôt give me a healthy sheen / glow. But this is thick enough that it sits just right in my skin. Will definitely buy again and I hope this does not discontinue!!!
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,This left me feeling extremely oily and broke me out after using it for a week.
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,holy grail for eczema & makeup!!,"I got a sample of this with one of my purchases and I‚Äôm in love! I‚Äôve never used a sunscreen that went so amazing with my makeup. Normally sunscreen makes my skin super dry, cracked or flakey so I never wore it. I‚Äôm But I have eczema and I‚Äôm definitely purchasing the big one since I‚Äôve been wanting to use SPF to prevent aging. It does exactly what it says. Made my skin dewy and didn‚Äôt mess with my makeup products either. I look flawless. This stuff is amazing and definitely a holy grail product from now on. Highly recommend!"
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,"Great moisturizer! I like that it‚Äôs both a moisturizer and sunscreen in one. I use a prescription retinol and it makes me burn so easily, this lasts all day and protects and moisturizes so well."
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,BEST SUNSCREEN EVER!,"I am absolutely obsessed with this sunscreen and moisturizer. The Sephora employee introduced me to this brand and I fell absolutely in love. This is definitely a product I won‚Äôt be able to live without. I already see my skin and dark acne spots getting lighter. My face feels hydrated. I have combo skin, my forehead gets oily but my cheeks feel super dry. This is the perfect sunscreen and moisturizer for me. No white cast for me. Love it!"
SUPERGOOP!-Superscreen Daily Moisturizer SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Horrible!,"The container is cute but the size is misleading, there is a much smaller amount of product than I expected. When I opened it I didn't detect any scent at all. I scooped some into my hand and applied to my face on the way out the door, and immediately regretted that decision. It smells SO bad, like something rancid! I was in a rush and had already left the house and had no way to wipe it off. After a minute in the car even my husband started complaining about the scent. It took nearly an hour for the smell to fade, ugh thankfully it was a long drive to where we were going because I would have been mortified to walk around in public smelling like this. Then about 20 minutes after applying I noticed my skin was stinging and burning. Again, I had no way to wipe it off. I don't have sensitive skin and even scented products don't typically bother me. This was a nightmare experience from a brand I've never tried before, and I would NOT recommend!"
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Supreme Screen Hydrating Facial Skinscreen SPF 50+,Singapore,Lightweight and No breakouts,"After years of trying sunscreens that have a biting sensation, make me breakout or leave a white cast, I have finally found one that works well. This sunblock blends in perfectly with my dark skin (my skin tone is Fenty foundation 370) and does not feel heavy on my skin.  "
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Supreme Screen Hydrating Facial Skinscreen SPF 50+,Singapore,Bad Smell. Oily Finish.,"Smells like nail polish remover. The fumes /smell  hurts the eyes a little. Leaves a sheen like an over-oiled/moisturised face (not necessarily dewy). Cream texture is ok. Tint doesn't come off like their LEAN SCREEN version. Still, doesn't seem worth the price. I often use this over my make up because it's too oily/wet after application to do my make up after. Not my favourite. Probably wont buy a second tube. Can't wait to finish it and move on from this brand altogether. Btw, I tried this in-store on my hand and it didnt yield the same oily finish immediately after like it did on my face - I concluded that this is due to the skin on face vs skin on other parts of us being different..so I guess this product is a hit/miss depending on your facial skin type. The smell wasnt noticeable at that point of testing either but on your face, it really annoys and I cant wear my face mask for a while after... Not for me."
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Supreme Screen Hydrating Facial Skinscreen SPF 50+,Singapore,real user,"This is so good! It‚Äôs very lightweight and hydrating. I have a sensitive/combination skin (dehydrated) and I found this is such a perfect sunscreen for me. It doesn‚Äôt leave any white cast and goes well with make up on top. No acne, no comedones after using it. Will definitely repurchase the product."
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Supreme Screen Hydrating Facial Skinscreen SPF 50+,Malaysia,i‚Äô m so in love ,"Finally i found sunscreen that suit my skin. Lightweight, fast absorption, non greasy and my skin feel comfortable even apply under makeup. Definitely will repurchase ! "
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Supreme Screen Hydrating Facial Skinscreen SPF 50+,Singapore,best sunscreen ever!! ,"Have tried all kinds of sunscreens in the market and nothing comes close to this! It is sooo hydrating, doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast or gets oily throughout the day and there is no smell at all. So so happy to have found this. "
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Supreme Screen Hydrating Facial Skinscreen SPF 50+,Singapore,Will repurchase ,"Lightweight, works well under makeup, not greasy, no white cast, high SPF 50. Easy to travel with the tube packaging. My go to sunblock product from AU. 
"
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Supreme Screen Hydrating Facial Skinscreen SPF 50+,Malaysia,best sunscreen ever ,"Zero white cast, feels comfortable on the skin, doesn‚Äôt feel oily and the best part my base makeup doesn‚Äôt slip and slide on top! Would defintely repurchase once I finish this one "
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Supreme Screen Hydrating Facial Skinscreen SPF 50+,Malaysia,Sunscreen,"I‚Äôm trying out this new sunscreen. So far it‚Äôs hydrating (I have dry combo skin), no white cast, glides easily on skin. Sits well under my foundation. Overall happy with this sunscreen. "
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Supreme Screen Hydrating Facial Skinscreen SPF 50+,Malaysia,moisturizing and lightweight,This is moisturizing enough to wear on its own for normal skin type. Doesn‚Äôt pill under make up and also gives a nice glow. It is very lightweight despite the hydration. It works very nicely as a primer too. 
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Supreme Screen Hydrating Facial Skinscreen SPF 50+,Singapore,miss,"fairly large tube for the price, smells weird when first pumped out but nice texture, weird smell gone once sits well into the skin, hydrating, no weird white sheen."
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Supreme Screen Hydrating Facial Skinscreen SPF 50+,Singapore,Easy absorption into the skin,"This sunscreen was the best sunscreen I‚Äôve tried so far. The product sinks into the skin seamlessly, almost like a moisturiser. It does leave a slightly tacky base, but it works sort of like a primer for make up. The only downside I can think of is that it may not be suitable for people with oilier skin. "
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Supreme Screen Hydrating Facial Skinscreen SPF 50+,Singapore,Very watery,"This has a scent to it and dries slightly tacky, whereas the fenty sunscreen dries matte. Both do well under makeup as chemical spfs but I still prefer fenty‚Äôs. Plus points: skincare benefits are superior with Ultra Violette; better price point is a godsend too."
THE INKEY LIST-Spf 30 Sunscreen,Malaysia,Very bad texture,"The texture very hard to apply on my skin even I have applied moisturizer before. After used 3-4 times it‚Äôs easier a little causes I have learned however I dont know it‚Äôs normal or not, it‚Äôs leaking some kind of warter with colour everytime I open it. Very very bad experience with this one. You shouldn‚Äôt buy it, believe me what a waste."
THE INKEY LIST-Spf 30 Sunscreen,Malaysia,Ms,At first I didn‚Äôt get why the texture of this sunscreen was like glumpy. And it take time to blend in my skin. But the results is so good. I rarely used foundation or any concealer and this sunscreen got toned up my skin colour. Really love it!
THE INKEY LIST-Spf 30 Sunscreen,Singapore,shopper,difficult to blend as it is streaky. it leaves a tacky base which may be good for makeup on top of it. needs a ton of powder to set if you are wearing it alone. 
THE INKEY LIST-Spf 30 Sunscreen,Malaysia,the best sunscreen. ,"A very good sunscreen, not drying the skin and feels light. I would repurchase again. I have tried several types of sunscreen but this is the best. Quickly absorbed, non -sticky and feels light."
THE INKEY LIST-Spf 30 Sunscreen,Malaysia,love,"This has been my fav since supergoop discontinued their mineral matte screen. It has the same texture, kind of melted playdough-ish but mattifies and smoothens skin after spreading. Also acts as a good make up base. Not sticky or oily or tacky. I am more particular about the texture and feel than efficacy when it comes to skin care coz if you dont love the texture you wont even use it long enough to see the effects! So this is definitely on my good list. However it is not waterproof but that‚Äôs fine coz i use a different sunblock when playing sports. Much love anyway please restock"
THE INKEY LIST-Spf 30 Sunscreen,Singapore,wouldn‚Äôt repurchase,Love the finish; it doesn‚Äôt look too oily on the skin. very apparent white cast on medium brown skin but it‚Äôs a mineral sunscreen and still works well under makeup anws. doesn‚Äôt rub in easily and coagulates in the bottle but it‚Äôs usable. 
THE INKEY LIST-Spf 30 Sunscreen,Malaysia,bad,Alot of white cast....very hard to rub it in...very uncomfortable to use and not convenient at all especially since it is suppose to be used in a daily basis
THE INKEY LIST-Spf 30 Sunscreen,Malaysia,the worst suncreen on earth,"one star because it simply is the worst sunscreen ever made. it's goopy, made clumps immediately upon application, and very difficult to blend in. created patches of uneven distribution that needs patch ups that would only make everything worse. stop buying this, a waste of money"
THE INKEY LIST-Spf 30 Sunscreen,Malaysia,disappointing ,"it is tinted but is sooo oily and coagulates. turns out patchy, crumbly. doesn‚Äôt sit well under makeup or even by itself. i gave this away to a friend and don‚Äôt know if she likes it. "
THE INKEY LIST-Spf 30 Sunscreen,Malaysia,Sunblock,Easy to apply but leaves white cast. Good coverage can be used daily. 
THE INKEY LIST-Spf 30 Sunscreen,Malaysia,NOO SKIP THIS,"This is by far the weirdest product/sunscreen ive ever tried. The texture is weird, it is SO hard to blend it. It becomes clumpy the minute you apply on your skin. Took me almost 15 minutes just to apply it on my cheeks ü•≤ And then it leaves this tacky feeling on your skin like its so sticky and feels weird idk just dont buy this. Not worth the money"
THE INKEY LIST-Spf 30 Sunscreen,Singapore,matte,"It is quite thick upon application and not very blendable. You need to put extra effort to blend it into the skin or else there will be white specks of sunscreen all over the skin surface. Not advisable for dry skin type. Nevertheless, for oily skin ppl, this might be a good option. If you blend it well enough, you will enjoy the matte finish. Probably one of the most matte sunscreen I've ever use."
THE INKEY LIST-Spf 30 Sunscreen,Malaysia,Doesn‚Äôt feel thick or heavy ,This is my second bottle. I love this sunscreen as it doesn‚Äôt feel pasty and doesn‚Äôt have a white cast. It has a slight tint that helps with my hyperpigmentation.
THE INKEY LIST-Spf 30 Sunscreen,Malaysia,just no,"absolutely rubbish this sunscreen.  as it is its tainted, it has such a dry texture. I couldn't even spread it on my face. even after I sprayed some water. it just won't spread. sort of like chunky consistency.  not sure if Sephora gave me an old stock or the product is just like that. but never again going to purchase this"
THE INKEY LIST-Spf 30 Sunscreen,Malaysia,good sunccreen,"this suncreen is good, doesnt leave any white cast on the skin, the skin feel hydrated. suitable for my skin and the price is affordable for spf30. love it."
THE INKEY LIST-Spf 30 Sunscreen,Malaysia,Worth to buy,My skin is super sensitive and this sunscreen is too suitable for my skin type (combination more to oily). This sunscreen also suitable for pregnancy mum since its mineral sunscreen. No whitecast anf worth to buy. 
THE INKEY LIST-Spf 30 Sunscreen,Singapore,..,"I love the ingredients, without all the harmful substances. I guess the best way to use it is to rub on palm and apply to face. I tried dabbing on skin but the formula turns to silicone-like too quickly n made it not easy to apply . It is the best under make up product for me as it does not make my face oily even on a hot afternoon. "
SK-II-Atmosphere CC Cream SPF 50 PA++++,Malaysia,great cc cream with spf50,"I tend to shy away from skin-whitening products 
cause it doesn‚Äôt sit well with my sensitive skin. But for the sake of this SK-II review, I stuck my neck out and tried SK-II‚Äôs Cc cream which is made with Japanese plum extract, a fruit known for its antioxidant and anti-glycation properties. Antioxidants are also great for sensitive skin like mine, because they help to protect it against free radicals that can damage skin cells and cause inflammation."
SK-II-Atmosphere CC Cream SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,not really a fan,The texture is light and easy to blend. Smell is acceptable. Pretty high spf 50 pa+ and it doesn‚Äôt not make my face looks oily. The down side is that it leaves a white cast and costly. 
SK-II-Atmosphere CC Cream SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,The best CC cream ,I‚Äôve tried this for weeks now and it is one of the best CC cream for my sensitive skin. It doesn‚Äôt make itchy and white cast.I feel flimsy and comfortable.It‚Äôs make my skin better.SKII is the best ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
SK-II-Atmosphere CC Cream SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,SK-II Atmosphere CC cream,Omgggggggggg. I love this so much. Started using SK-II since last year. My acne and combi skin turns better. Breakout stop and face now is neutral (not oily and not dry). This is another product added. Will repurchase again and again once running out. Thank you.
SK-II-Atmosphere CC Cream SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,wonderful ,"Super fan of SK II ! Started to slowly buy all the products for myself:) most of my friends said I got nicer skin tone after I use it for a while , give me more confidence to change all my skin care products to sk ii "
EST√âE LAUDER-Perfectionist Pro Multi-Defense UV Fluid SPF 45/PA++++,Singapore,Estee Lauder Perfectionist Pro,"Bought this for my mom & so far she said its good. I believe this product is quite gentle on the skin and suits my mom's sensitive skin. 
Good purchase, will consider to buy it again! "
EST√âE LAUDER-Perfectionist Pro Multi-Defense UV Fluid SPF 45/PA++++,Singapore,no go ," Not a good Uv for me. Although I love how my face is glowy and looks radiance after application, however I think it is causing some breakout on my face. I had pimples when I use it and when I stop it everything is ok? "
EST√âE LAUDER-Perfectionist Pro Multi-Defense UV Fluid SPF 45/PA++++,Malaysia,daily uv protection ,"Use it under my EL's cushion foundation.. It leaves a soft white shiny effect.. Not too oily, just perfect for daily use.it won't dried out your skin. "
EST√âE LAUDER-Perfectionist Pro Multi-Defense UV Fluid SPF 45/PA++++,Malaysia,Good to be used under make-up,"This sunscreen improves my skin condition over time. It is also amazing to be used under make-up. The foundation on me looks brighter and smoother as if my face naturally shines. The price is steep for 30ml, hence the 4.5 stars. I would continue to repurchase if I can‚Äôt find a replacement. "
EST√âE LAUDER-Perfectionist Pro Multi-Defense UV Fluid SPF 45/PA++++,Malaysia,White Cast,"I bought this because it has a higher SPF.  However, this product leaves a layer of white cast on my face. It would probably be fine for someone with fair skin."
EST√âE LAUDER-Perfectionist Pro Multi-Defense UV Fluid SPF 45/PA++++,Singapore,happy with this purchase ,This product gives a white cast which is fine to me and my foundation doesn‚Äôt run over this sunblock. Texture is runny and not filmy. Comfortable on face. Would be good if it‚Äôs spf50. 
EST√âE LAUDER-Perfectionist Pro Multi-Defense UV Fluid SPF 45/PA++++,,more white overcast than normal,the sunscreen has a white overcast which seems to be higher than my other sunscreens. but my backstage foundation by dior seemed to last longer with this sunscreen. will try it out with other brand foundations and update the review 
CLINIQUE-Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF 50/PA++++,Malaysia,Definitely a NO for medium skin tones!,"At first I thought it was tinted, bcs it was written somewhere before this. I'm always a fan of mineral sunscreens as I have sensitive skin. Tinted is always better, for me at least. This sunscreen not only leaves a white cast, but more like a bluish/purple white cast on my medium olive skin. I say definitely skip this if you're not WHITE or if you have a combo-oily skin bcs this definitely leaves a greasy film."
CLINIQUE-Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF 50/PA++++,Singapore,Meh. Leaves a white cast.,"Definitely leaves a white cast. You really have to spread it and spread it and spread it to not have that white cast. For the price, the amount of product is... very little. It is nothing to write home about. Look, it probably works as a sunscreen but it will clog your pores, leave a white cast and make you feel not so great. Do not recommend."
CLINIQUE-Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF 50/PA++++,Singapore,does what it says,it's an excellent sun block. recently went to the beach when it was extremely hot. the areas where I did not put the sunblock was sunburnt badly. and the areas where I did put the sunblock were fine. it might cause a white cast on your face though.
CLINIQUE-Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF 50/PA++++,Singapore,Does the job,A decent sunblock plus skincare product that provides skin protection while promoting healing. Was out in nature while using this all over my face and body and not a single tan line or burnt skin. Can‚Äôt use on a daily basis because it‚Äôs too oily for my skin type‚Äîcauses acne over time.
CLINIQUE-Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF 50/PA++++,Singapore,In two minds,"I'm not sure if I like this sunscreen. It leaves a greasy look on application, and definitely leaves a white cast on my brown skin...but it does subside somewhat after 5-10 minutes of application. If I were to avoid the white cast completely, I'd have to use very little product and that would beat the purpose of using a sunscreen. Also, it stings the eye if you sweat and the sweat gets in your eye...have learnt it the hard way after I wore it to the gym and my eyes started watering because of the sting! "
CLINIQUE-Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF 50/PA++++,Malaysia,good sunscreen for sensitive skin,The thing that i like about this sunscreen is that is smooth application not overly dry and nonwhite cast‚Ä¶its non transferable but after 8 hours it will make your normal skin face oily but not too much‚Ä¶for normal skin you are going to love the glowy effects that this suncreen gives‚Ä¶i like that its also mineral type and 50 spf++++
CLINIQUE-Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF 50/PA++++,Singapore,decided to try,"I am buying this cream for the first time. At first glance, the cream looks good: lightweight texture. I already have dark spots, I hope the cream will reduce their amount. "
CLINIQUE-Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF 50/PA++++,Malaysia,for my mom,"so far my mom liked it, bought for her for her birthday, i tried like once and its preatty good actually, the scent it not to strong and fast absorb into the skin."
CLINIQUE-Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF 50/PA++++,Malaysia,Great for light to light-medium skin,"Excellent physical sunscreen that doesn't irritate my eczema prone skin. I love that it's not fragranced, is alcohol free and is a solid SPF 50. Price is steep so picked it up in the sale, am glad I did! It may however leave a slight white cast on medium skin tones."
CLINIQUE-Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF 50/PA++++,Singapore,Thick yet hydrating,it's a fairly good sunscreen but it does leave white layer on top of your skin. formula is good as I didn't have any breakouts using this even though I have sensitive skin.
CLINIQUE-Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF 50/PA++++,Malaysia,love it,It suit my skin and the climate that I currently live at (tropical climate). I don't mind the white layer after apply. As long as the product doesn't breakout my skin. 
CLINIQUE-Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF 50/PA++++,Malaysia,love the product but be mindful,"My favorite sunscreen as they dont break me out. However, upon purchasing I found out that sephora only carries the sheer version of the sunscreen while in Clinique counter in Malaysia they have the sheer tint. I prefer the tinted one as I feel the sheer one tends to give me some white cast - not that disturbing but I do prefer the tinted one better."
CLINIQUE-Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF 50/PA++++,Malaysia,My Skin but Better ,"Because of recent pandemic, though have to wear mask everyday but still need to look good when you take off the mask. Also because of the hot weather, I wear less foundation nowadays. This Clinique sunscreen works great on my skin, making my skin looks really translucent and young! Non sticky! No white cast! Just sit perfectly! "
CLINIQUE-Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF 50/PA++++,Malaysia,My face protector!!,"The reason I bought Clinique Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF50+++ because it is safe for use around the eye area. Living in Malaysia, I am looking for a sunscreen that protects my skin from harmful UVA rays without clogging it and also treat my skin from pigmentation such as dark spots, sun spots and freckles. I love putting the sunscreen after my skincare, either when I go out or when I stay at home, works well alone or under the makeup. It feels barely-there and does not leave a white cast.  I can see the pigmentations on my face got reduced tremendously, my pores do not look clogged at all and the best thing is my skin looks instantly brightens and even out skin tone. 

The sunscreen is in a gorgeous white bottle with a small nozzle that disperses the right amount of sunscreen.  Easy to carry around and a must-have in my handbag. Worth every sen!! "
CLINIQUE-Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF 50/PA++++,Malaysia,One of the best SPF,After trying so many different brands of sunblock I still love this one as it doesn't give a oily feel and the no colour sunblock is definitely a plus point. Price is on the high side however it works really well. 
CLINIQUE-Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF 50/PA++++,Singapore,perfect for me,"Love this for my sensitive skin. Feel like it even provides some extra moisture when worn on top of moisturizer, though not in any sort of uncomfortable, heavy-feeling way. High uva/uvb protection is of course a major plus. Took half a star off because it does leave a white cast. Not really noticeable on my paler skin, but might be an issue for someone with a darker skin tone."
CLINIQUE-Even Better Dark Spot Defense SPF 50/PA++++,Malaysia,Dark spot begone,"I face the sun everyday, sun makes my pimples become dark, so it is very important for me the pimples kind of skin to use this as it protects me from getting dark spot.‚ò∫Ô∏è"
DIOR-Prestige Light-In-White The UV Protector Youth And Light Sheer Glow SPF 50+ PA+++,Singapore,recommended,"Suitable for all skin types! I have very dry and sensitive skin, trying my first bottle and loving it. Abit pricey and will restock only during vib sale "
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Malaysia,Not really like,"Personally I don‚Äôt like this product. After just once use on face, I‚Äôm now using it for body as I feel it‚Äôs quite sticky. Also, Im not wearing make up, then I need a tone up sunscreen rather than this one "
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Singapore,Nope! ,"I don‚Äôt like it. I‚Äôve fair dry combination skin, this goes on the face like water which is not easy to apply as I tend to have to apply quite a bit cos it dries down way too fast. The texture is too light, not suitable to be use as a primer, does not correct the skin tone like other primer and made my makeup looking unfinished. Makeup melted after 30 mins and became very tacky too in SG weather. I never had such issue with other primers. This is only 30ml and way too pricey because it doesn‚Äôt work. Will not repurchase. "
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Malaysia,primer and sunblock 2 in 1,My sister swear by this product and she never really buy any other brands than clinique so I either she is just a loyal or she is afraid to test out different brand in the market
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Malaysia,Good,"I a loyal user of clinique for many many years, I have been on the antiblemish range for 20 years now n it never disappoint me, when this pops up I just had to try it, its a nice gel primer that has spf in it, really love using this n will be repurchasing for sureü•∞"
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Malaysia,Favorite Clinique Product,Nice primer with spf.  It has no weird smell like most sunblock and it is a light gel that is best for my combination skin.  I like to apply it on some days and go out without any make up.  
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Malaysia,good base with spf,"It gives smooth base and effective spf for a primer. Doesnt clog pores, and light on the skin. The cons are the smell & sometimes it get tacky when we sweat too much"
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Malaysia,fantastic product,"Bought this during sale and only bought it because my usual sunscreen was out of stock. The price is a little bit pricey for its size.
Product wise, this is definitely a very¬≤ great sunscreen and can be used as a primer as well. I really love it as it not only protects your skin from harmful sun ray but also makes makeup glides easily. Will purchase it when there is a sale or as a backup when my fave sunscreen is out of stock."
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Malaysia,ok,"Good okay just nice for my skin. Good okay just 
nice for my skin. Good okay just nice for my skin. Good okay just nice for my skin. Good okay just nice for my skin"
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Malaysia,Amazing Product,"Finally found an SPF product that works for my skin.  Sephora has run out of this product and has not been in stock for so long as I wanted to purchase it again. So, I have to find another alternative."
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Singapore,Light texture,"Beautiful aqua-like texture that makes this pink-tinted sunblock / primer a breeze to use. Does nothing to brighten my skin (I'm a no.22 RMS skin tone). Absorbs into the skin easily. Therefore, a great base for prepping for makeup."
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Malaysia,Recommended!,"go through the reviews before I purchase it. After the first trial, it surprisingly works well on my skin, non-sticky at all, will definitely come back to repurchase it"
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Singapore,unexpectedly awesome,"not sure what made me purchase this. but this is just so awesome! it is a sunblock plus it makes your skin so smooth and perfect after putting it on, you don't need make up. it's almost too good to be true."
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Singapore,Luv this primer!!,"I saw reviews that this brightening gel + primer is really nice for acne prone, dull, dehydrated skin. When I rcv it, didn't let me down. Had a nice skin tone colour to it and brightens my skin up upon application, also feels very comfy on my skin. Holds my makeup at least for a couple of hours without my UD setting spray. So glad I found something that has skin care ingredients. Worth every single cent I spent here at Sephora. "
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Malaysia,Ms,I just love this product. It is non sticky on my face and absorb well as well. Worth my money and it is one of the best sun screen i used. Can also be used as primer before make up
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Singapore,Best primer i have used,"This is hands down the best primer I‚Äôve used so far! It is not greasy at all as compared to other primers I have used, feels smooth on skin and brightens up my complexion as well! Perfect for daily use even as a sunblock :) Will continue to purchase this product. "
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Malaysia,the best,the best sunblock ever.. not sticky or greasy also not irritating.. watery base sunblock..  easy to apply on face.. i had try a few sunblock but this one the best.. having spf 45 enough for me... 
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Malaysia,Best Primer,Best ever primer I had ever used! Really love this! Second time purchased this awesome product. Will continuously use this primer. It‚Äôs works well as per product name.
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Singapore,non greasy gel spf ,"It is a nice non greasy gel spf to wear any day. However, I wouldn‚Äôt use it as a primer as it doesn‚Äôt really give a base for makeup as such. But definitely a good daily wear spf to use after moisturiser. "
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Malaysia,yay,"This is an amazing sunscreen I use it almost everyday before stepping out.. Its not greasy.. doesn't irritate my skin.. I like the tint that it leaves behind after application.. It does offer good sun protection but i had to reapply it after abt 2-3 hrs but that goes for most sunscreens.. 

Overall I really like this product though its a bit costly.. I will be repurchasing it till I'm bored of using this one or until I find something better."
CLINIQUE-Even Better City Block Brightening Aqua Gel + Anti-Pollution Primer SPF 45/PA+++,Malaysia,what ive been looking for,"non-oily texture, light moisturiser, no white cast eventhough high spf level, pinkish gel that automatically tone up and adds glow to ur complexion. I would not mind applying it alone without foundation or other makeup. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
SHISEIDO-Global Suncare Perfect UV Protector Hydrofresh,Malaysia,Officer,"Physical blockers also tend to be thicker and more difficult to rub in. The price is quite expensive, however, it‚Äôs valuable for high-end product.
My skin is oily and sensitive"
SHISEIDO-Global Suncare Perfect UV Protector Hydrofresh,Singapore,"Good sunscreen, but a little pricey","Unlike other sunscreens the Shiseido global Suncare Perfect UV Protector Hydrofresh does not leave a white residue and absorbs quite well into the skin. The 50ml however is quite small, and considering I apply it everyday, can tend to get a little pricey. "
SHISEIDO-Global Suncare Perfect UV Protector Hydrofresh,Singapore,sunscreen ,"Theres alcohol in it and I didn‚Äôt realise. It kind of stings when applying on the face. Even though it states as waterproof but after sweating, there‚Äôs still white bits on my face. Won‚Äôt suggest sensitive skin to use it. "
CHARLOTTE TILBURY-Invisible UV Flawless Poreless Primer SPF 50 PA++++,Australia,glowy,Great product. It makes my skin glow after application and yet doesnt make it sticky. Only gripe would be the price point. It is quite pricey for the volume youre getting. But it does last decently long if you dont wear it daily
CHARLOTTE TILBURY-Invisible UV Flawless Poreless Primer SPF 50 PA++++,Singapore,not poreless,This is not poreless primer as advertise but it is hydrating and I love the high SPF but I need a hydrating and poreless primer. It is not a bad primer for people with dry skin but with no pore concerns. And there is no white cast etc like some primers do have.
SKIN INC-Serum UV Moisturizer SPF 50+ PA+++,Singapore,good product,"The best sunscreen i have ever used. Doesnt cause breakout or leave a white cast on face. However, this has been out of stock for a long time. Bring it back please!"
SKIN INC-Serum UV Moisturizer SPF 50+ PA+++,Singapore,Long Lasting Product,"Despite the size, the serum lasts for months and months. a few drops to the face is sufficient. Spreads easily and absorbs well into the face. A product that pleasantly surprised me."
SKIN INC-Serum UV Moisturizer SPF 50+ PA+++,Singapore,buy if you are going to use it soon,Have not tried the product but rather short expiry. Ordered in January and the product expiry is in September. No wonder it is on discount. Buy only if you are going to use it soon. 
SKIN INC-Serum UV Moisturizer SPF 50+ PA+++,Singapore,Fan,Repeat buy. Love how non oily formula this doesn‚Äôt cause breakouts for my sensitive skin. Its clear enough to wear under makeup as well as on its own.
SKIN INC-Serum UV Moisturizer SPF 50+ PA+++,Singapore,An expensive sunscreen,An expensive sunscreen; nonetheless it is a worthwhile buy as it doesn‚Äôt smell of sunscreen and it does it job well and gives sufficient protection. Just that I might not rebuy given the high price. 
SKIN INC-Serum UV Moisturizer SPF 50+ PA+++,Singapore,not great for oily skin,"I had high hopes this would suit my oily skin when I first squeezed out the product and a near-solid paste came out. But after shaking the bottle (which is the proper way to use it), the product texture is more like milk. Sadly this leaves me shiny in 2 hours working from home indoors so I‚Äôd consider it a fail for my skin type. "
SKIN INC-Serum UV Moisturizer SPF 50+ PA+++,Singapore,easy application ,"Goes on easily and doesn‚Äôt leave white cast, however it does smell like sunscreen (some kind of chemical smell) which some may not like. Overall, just ok "
THREE-Balancing UV Protector R,Singapore,Madam,"It is 2nd time buy for this UV product under this brand THREE. It‚Äôs very effective to prevent UV lines and keep skin at the good status under the sun shine. The only thing needs to highlight is the smell of the product - similar as medicine but can be accepted. All in all, it is a good organic product from THREE who focus on nature products. "
SHISEIDO-Future Solution LX Universal Defense,Singapore,I like it,"Have been using this sunscreen, will definitely purchase again after I finish with my first tube.  Nice fragrance not too overpowering but nice.  I like this product and my Shiseido compact foundation, goes well together."
SHISEIDO-Future Solution LX Universal Defense,Singapore,Not Much Hydration,"Hydrates skin for short of 3 hours after application, in a non-airconditioned room. Not recommended unless you have oily skin. Really not worth the money spent. Shiseido products have been dropping in quality but increasing in price. "
SHISEIDO-BB For Sports SPF 50+ PA+++ Tinted Sunscreen,Singapore,Mrs,"Not very dark, I‚Äôm a fair - medium and this shade is just perfect. Dries very quickly, probably the only drawback. Stays put whatever you do and remains impeccable throughout the day, even if you swim. "
SK-II-Atmosphere Airy Light UV Emulsion SPF30 PA+++ Sunscreen,Singapore,SKII ,"Pricey, however does give a healthy sheen to the skin, you are able to see visible tiny glitters on your skin after application. Looks abit oily mid-day."
SK-II-Atmosphere Airy Light UV Emulsion SPF30 PA+++ Sunscreen,Singapore,smooth and light,"the texture is supremely soft, like clouds enveloping my face. I use this for work from home days, when I don't need such a high SPF coverage. I can also top up throughout the day as needed"
CLE DE PEAU-UV Protective Cream SPF 50+,Singapore,Light on the face,"I was honestly contemplating getting this sunscreen since the price for such a small bottle is on the higher end. However, having used it for a few weeks, I can tell you that this cream is so light on the face. Almost all other sunscreens I use tend to make my skin oily after a while. For this specific reason, I would recommend this product. "
CLE DE PEAU-UV Protective Cream SPF 50+,Singapore,love this! ,Best sunscreen I‚Äôve used recently. The texture is gel like and thin. This makes my skin look dewy and glowy. Good for applying underneath makeup as it doesn‚Äôt cause pilling and its good for dry skin! 
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,not for me,Very ashy and thick. It will look cakeky and separated. Already sold it to my friend. Not gonna repurchase‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Unbelievable ,"I love anything sunscreen & I love Supergoop. So when there‚Äôs new product launching I must buy & try. I have an eye cream but normally for day time I used Sunday Riley‚Äôs Autocorrect to banish the tired and puffy eyes until I tried this.. to my surprise, the effect is just like Autocorrect, if not better! Coz it has sun protection. Definitely repurchase!"
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,"I love this product, just wish it came in a full size because I use it all over my face."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,It was a no until it wasn't!,"Ok, so I understand all the criticism but hear me out! I use it a certain way and it's been working wonders for my skin. I'll put the whole dollop on my hand and blend it like crazy (yes, this is a bit wasteful), then I delicately place this on my eyes and nose - basically center of my face outwards. It not only blends well but it brightens/conceals any dark spots and evens things out giving me this luminous glow. Better than any tint SPF I have used! 40spf, mineral, and EWG-safe. For naysayers, I think blending it very well in the hand and then applying will help with the crepey skin effect."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Okay,I bought this eye cream for sun protection around the eye. There are very few eye creams with SPF left on the market. Shisheido had one that was my favorite but it isn‚Äôt available anymore. My regular regular sunscreen
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Sits on the skin,"I‚Äôve been using this for around a month, it‚Äôs ok. It sits on the skin and leaves an odd color sitting there and it does not blend in with my tinted serum. It‚Äôs a bit better when I only wear sunscreen."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Holy Grail Product,"Have been using for years.  In the winter this product provides great brightening without makeup. In the summer, helps lighten my dark circles, as this is a giver spf than I use on the rest of my face. Can‚Äôt recommend this product enough."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,love,I love this eye cream. A little goes a long way. I don‚Äôt experience the pilling others have mentioned unless I use too much. I don‚Äôt apply the same way I do other eye creams where I want to lather it. I just tap a couple drops below and above eye to prevent sun damage. Beats any other eye cream spf option I have tried.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Ok texture and application but expensive,"Unlike other reviews, I haven‚Äôt had issues with the product piling or having weird texture. The texture is mixed between cream and primer texture. At some point the texture became more liquid but I gave it a good shake and it dispensed cream-like texture afterward. No issue with blending and absorption, I use it under makeup. Probably will not purchase again due to high price and can just use face sunscreen. "
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Finished the bottle, NOT repurchasing","When I walked in and asked where this was the employee said they dont carry anything like it, that shouldve warned me not to buy it. All but one bottle also had already expired. Took me 10 months to go through this, it does not work under any makeup, regardless of how I prepped my under eyes, I have normal skin - bit dry in the winter. The only way I could wear this was on no makeup days, and immediately after washing my face while damp. You have to stop blending at THE perfect time or it will pill up, and it looks awful midday no matter what. I found this looked the least awful in the summer, I have not one single positive to say about this product."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Pills, dies down unpleasantly, too thick","I'd read the reviews complaining that this pills but I thought I'd risk it because nothing like sunscreen during those bright, sunny summer days, right? I regret that. It really does pill the minute you use anything other than very very gentle tapping motions or even lightly tug at the under eye area. It has a weird dry down, too, kind of patchy and powdery. Does not at all feel hydrating or moisturizing or nourishing. I can't even imagine trying to go over this with makeup. I guess the slight pigment means that you can get away with only this if you're feeling a natural kind of day, but I'd dread using concealer over this product. The consistency is super thick though and it does that thing where it dries in a gloopy, thick ball and jams up the nozzle where the product comes out of. I don't think I'll purchase this again."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Save your money,Do not recommend at all! Peels like crazy no matter what you do. Bad formula
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Seems to do the trick,I'm pretty pale and most sunscreen  is irritating if close to the eyes. This seems to bridge that gap.i also appreciate the brightening effect
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,"When I start a new bottle the product goes on to the skin very nicely. It is thick and it does have a peach tone so it is good for brightening the eye area. When the bottle has been open for a while and gets a bit older I do agree with other reviewers hear that it pills on the skin. Having said that, I like that it is a mineral sunscreen and I like how my make up sits on top of it. Hence I do continue to purchase it again and continue wearing it."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,"I am so happy I found this product. I‚Äôve never used spf on my eyes, but since I‚Äôm in my 40‚Äôs now, I‚Äôm realizing it‚Äôs past time! I use the Supergoop face cream, which I love, and I love this product as well. I use it over an eye serum, and have never had issues with dryness or pilling. It doesn‚Äôt sting my eyes, a little goes a long way, so it‚Äôs lasted me forever. As long as this product is available I will use it!"
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Pills. I tried everything to make it work because I really wanted to love it. I really liked everything about it just from reading the descriptions. I also love that it does not string the eyes because that was an issue I faced with the Supergoop face sunscreen I used at the time. I have since moved on to sunscreens that I can used on the entire face that don't sting and work well with my skincare and makeup. If you are someone who doesn't use any other skincare or makeup products around the eyes you might be able to make this work.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Non-absorbant,"There is a white cast after applying under eye. Very sticky, and creamy, and burns if applied too much and gets into eyes. Definitely not needed at all."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,nice eye cream with SPF,I have been using this for years as it was one of the few eye creams with SPF back in the day. It doesn't burn my eyes at all!
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,"I love this product, cannot live without it. I have not have any of the problems mentioned in the reviews. It hydrates without making my eyes greasy, it does not bother my sensitive eyes, and it doesn‚Äôt leave any white cast. I really just dislike the price, however it lasts awhile, since a little goes a long way."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Loving It!,I have dry skin & this product does a great job of hydrating & brightening my under eyes. Doesn‚Äôt crease or cake up! Love the spf factor!
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Nice at first but I had breakouts on my eyelid after using for a week. This will be returned.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not bad! But not my favorite‚Ä¶,"I really liked the idea of this product! It has a great sheer color and doesn‚Äôt sting my eyes. However, once the product dries down, the pigment settles into any fines lines that I have and will very easily pill up when touched. I think I‚Äôll use up the bottle I have, but I just can‚Äôt justify buying another. Especially since it‚Äôs hard to layer anything (like concealer) on top of this product."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,not what I expected ,"I had high expectations and was excited about this product but unfortunately, it Does not absorb well. needs to use in small amounts otherwise, it makes every single wrinkle obvious I'm not sure if I get full protection doing so. "
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Very Nice, Non-stinging, eye screen","First & foremost, this product needs to be applied after an eye cream. Do Not Recommend by its lonesome. (See the reviews of dry complaints). 
Tiniest pearl size is all that‚Äôs needed. Slight pink/peach tinge so it helps with dark circles. 
My only complaint is the pump is a bit too strong."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Superfood Eye,"Love this product, it is light and easy to apply. Brightens really good under my eyes. I would definitely recommend this product."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,i probably will never buy again,"I have this a try on multiple occasions. 
What I liked: the color is a nice sheen nude color that was nice to apply as SPF that did not leave a white cast
What I disliked: it pilled into little balls every single time and left me with streaks of flaking every single time!!! I applied it alone and it still pilled and flaked! Therefore, because of this alone, I could not wear it."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,"i looooove the supergoop glow cream, the body oil, the regular sunscreen, love them. but this‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt know what it is, but it made my eyes and skin around my eyes burn. it‚Äôs so weird, because no of the other fave products give me any kind of reaction."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Extreme pilling,I tried this after Supergoop! discontinued a previous mineral eye sunscreen that I used for years. This new version pills so much it's useless. I'm using a chemical sunscreen that burns my eyes while I find a new mineral sunscreen. This product isn't it.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,love!!,"Was hesitant to buy this with so many bad reviews but wow! For a mineral sunscreen this stuff blends in great and I‚Äôve had no issues with product drying up in the tube‚Äîif anything, I love the pump design because I know it‚Äôs keeping that SPF nice and fresh. Love this so far!"
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Love love it!,it's so great to have a separate sunscreen for eye area which is one of our most delicate part of our face. it's not oily at all and even give a brightening effect. love it and will always be on top of my list!
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Goopy, Not in a Good Way","I liked this product when I first tried it, so I don't know if they've changed the formula or what but I am now not a fan. You know how a dried clump forms in a pump product you haven't used in a while? Well this forms one Every. Single. Day. Just like it says on the lid. So every morning I have to pry a clump out of the product before I can use it. I would guess a significant amount goes to waste because of that. This product also does not play well with others - especially hyaluranic acid. No matter how long I let my skin ""dry"" after applying, this eye cream pills up. I end up having to wipe away pills with a damp wash cloth, which I am pretty sure renders applying an SPF product to my eyes useless. I wish SuperGoop would offer the old eye SPF product in the tube again. This one is unfortunately a hard pass for me."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Great,This is a great addition to serious sunscreen regiment.  It brightens the eye area & does not sting or get in your eyes as many other sunscreens do.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,terrible,This is a terrible product. It drying for the under eyes and exacerbates your eye wrinkles
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Nope nope nope nope nope,"I love Supergoop! Sunscreen! But this is a fail. The texture is like goopy snot, so it is pilled right out of the bottle. Trying it out I have chunks of pilled sunscreen around my eyes.. I tried some on the back of my hand and it took a lot of rubbing in to get it smooth. That isn‚Äôt gonna work around your eyes. I can‚Äôt imagine trying to wear this under makeup / concealer. I even tried shaking the bottle. What a mess. It is immediately being returned. Did I get a bad batch? ‚Ä¶ cause this is bad."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Nope nope nope. This felt heavy on my skin. It balled up when applying and stung my eyes.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,"I‚Äôve definitely had a different experience with this product than some of those negative reviews. The formula is definitely thick but I find it covers, blends, and brightens nicely. I normally only use this when I know I‚Äôm going to be out in the sun for the day. It‚Äôs so gentle and never stings plus I find that the thick creamy texture keeps this from running or getting greasy as you sweat or swim."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Better on Paper than Eyes,"I chose this because I was looking for an eye cream with SPF.  Unfortunately this isn't the right product. The formulation is WAY too thick to rub into the under-eye area completely and ends up pilling.  It doesn't so much ""brighten"" as leaves a white cast.  I won't be buying this again."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,"dried out fast, did not last long. ","bought this mainly because of hype. but the product felt like it dried up too fast in the bottle. always had to pump out the dried part out everytime i use it. only used it a few times because i was it was dried out. unfortunately didn‚Äôt reach out for it anymore. would not purchase again :( when used, product was tinted, felt alright. "
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Mixed feelings,"I really like it after using for a few weeks. However, I've noticed that it does ball up if it's not compatible with some skincare. I wouldn't use this with thicker moisturiser. It doesn't sting my eyes and give a brighter under eye look. Not very obvious but it does have some brightening effect. I don't think it's skincare though, could be a makeup ingredient. I don't really reach for it if I'm using the unseen sunscreen. I used this with it's sunscreen moisturiser and works well together. It's not as important as I thought it would be but it's nice to have. You can never get enough of sunscreen when you're living in a sunny island. "
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,This product really creased. The formulation takes awhile to dry and it would get in my eyes and sting.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,"I know some of the reviews I read complained about this product in regards to having trouble getting it to blend in but I have had wonderful luck with this and I love it. I use tinted mineral SPF anyway daily but I love extra targeted protection and I love the brightening affect this has. For reference I am a tan skinned black women, and I find that if I am feeling a bit dry, using hyaluronic acid and a bit of oil underneath the eyes really helps keep it from looking a bit pale. I would be really interested to see how this looks on anyone who has deeper richer skin then me in regards to white cast"
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Great SPF eye cream,"First time use this SPF sunscreen eye cream , I like eye cream teksture but can only use small amount for long way . I happy use this product to protect my eye from sun . Overall is a great eye cream !"
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,A rare repurchased item,"I rarely take pictures of myself, took a selfie w/ my son on vacation and was shocked at the amount of freckles I have now. Need a sunscreen I can put near my eyes. This is the perfect product. Light, not shimmery or matte definitely has a natural glow finish. I actually repurchased this item and can tell you the first pump is so light and creamy! The last pump is a little dried out. Which is sad since it‚Äôs in an airless pump. A little expensive but the other face sunscreens from this brand sting the eyes. Probably intentionally. Wish I had this formula for the whole face!"
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,disappointing,The bottle is designed in a way that product will stay in the pump after use and get hard by the next day when you use it again. This causes each pump to be half dried out and unusable. I love supergoop other products but this one is 100% a waste of money.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Poor packaging,I LOVEDDD the old Supergoop SPF eye cream from a few years ago that came in a tube. It was way easier to dispense and did not waste product like this packaging does! This one dispenses way too much and I end up throwing away 1/2 of what's dispensed. The cream itself is okay-  it ends up balling up when I apply concealer or foundation... even after waiting 5 minutes for it to dry/soak in.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Poor Consistency,"This product is far too thick, butter-like, application is nightmare as you can‚Äôt smooth it out without pulling on the delicate skin around eyes which is a no-no. I tried dabbing gently  with my finger but it just won‚Äôt work, balls up and looks patchy. It‚Äôs a shame because it does have a subtle, beautiful glow to it, which brightens up the eyes and looks oh so pretty. It‚Äôs also a godsend to use underneath concealer, acts as a perfect canvas and is the only product I‚Äôve ever used that truly doesn‚Äôt let concealer set into the lines (no primer has accomplished this for me). But I can‚Äôt get past poor application due to product‚Äôs consistency."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,I wanted to try this product because I have dark circles and wanted to protect that area from sun damage. Overall I like the formula: it's like a light whipped texture that leaves a mostly matte with slight sheen texture on the skin and melts into my under eye area well. The problem I have with it is every time I use it there is a bit of hardened product that come out that is unusable. I use so little everyday that it almost seems like I'm wasting more product than I'm using! I hope they can get this issue fixed.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,way too thick and oily,Very thick and oily on my eyes. Also very hard to blend
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,sensitive eye safe,Only sunscreen that has not burned my eyes. I‚Äôve used it everyday for a month without issues. Gives a nice glow. Everyday staple now.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Good Eye Cream but Not the Best,"I find that this under-eye cream does its job, it has some what of a illuminating effect and has a small tint to it. This is perfect for someone who is constantly in the sun and I would recommend! Also a little goes a really long way!!!"
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,wonderful,"This eye cream is amazing for my under eye dark circles. The product makes the under eye appear lighter post application (bonus- sunscreen). Also i noticed my dark circles getting lighter with use. A must have for tropical climate and protection of delicate under eye area. Also I have sensitive eyes and whereas other products sting my eye even when apply a but further from my eye, this one is gentle and does nor sting my eye making it more wearable."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Nope. Good but nope more buying this.,Stings still. EltaMD is waaay better. This has an ugly clumpy finish that is quite difficult to blend out. My eyes area can be super irritated during days when I wear makeup quite often. This is a good product honestly but you don't have a lot of space to rub this in around your eye. Plus the skin around the area is very delicate which makes rubbing this in actually push the skin quite deep in. Not pleasant. Just get EltaMD if you are going to splurge like this.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,"I love all the sunscreens this brand makes but this particular product is not up to snuff. The consistency feels too thick no matter how little I try to use and does not blend well. Since it‚Äôs a mineral sunscreen, it will leave a slight cast ‚Äî I think they added the tint to try to prevent this but there is no way the shade will match everyone‚Äôs skin. And the dispenser has a way of getting gunky."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,"This stuff is great! Instantly perks up my eyes, non-irritating and provides SPF!"
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Great product,It's a thick cream like consistency which works well for my undereyes. I have tan skin and the white cast is not that visible but it's slightly noticable
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Brightens,My first sunscreen for around eyes. Ok acceptable. As the product says it does brightens the Eye area and importantly no irritation experienced. Thick consistency so little sticky though. 
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Best hydrating sunscreen for under eye,"Favorite eye brightening, hydrating sunscreen. Doesn't burn like other sunscreens and it makes any concealer layered on top look even better, though most of the time this functions like a light concealer on its own"
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,WONDERFUL PRODUCT! You need IT!,"I feel it like a primer for my makeup because of the consistency, it‚Äôs thick. But I‚Äôm not mad at it. 
Sometimes that area of the eye need a little extra help with dryness and there‚Äôs not a lot of products out there for the day that also protects you from the sun.!
This is great! I just simply love this brand and this particular product! Will buy it again!!"
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,"I started using this product after I noticed freckles appearing on my under eye area end it does a great job as far as sun protection. It does not wear well under make up but I don‚Äôt wear a lot in the summer so this doesn‚Äôt end up being a big deal. I do notice my transition eyeshadow shade getting caught up, pilly and patchy when I bring the eye cream too far up my under eye."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,love,Glad there‚Äôs a product that protects the gentle under eye area! I find that warming the product up between my ring fingers makes it easier to spread.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Terrible container, great product","I'm so glad to see a sunscreen that's safe for eyes. This is one of the very few, and I like it fine. But the packaging is terrible. What's with all this ""style over substance"" packaging? The lid is not airtight, so the product dries out at the tip of the pump and forms a little plug. So you waste a bit every time you use it. And, you there's no way of knowing how much is left. So you have to run out before you can restock. I used to be in marketing for a packaged good, and worked with the packaging designers to find a design that was both functional and beautiful. It's not that hard. And, this is not the only expensive cosmetics product that has terrible packaging. I feel like I keep writing the same review for different cosmetics products."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,You don‚Äôt need it,"I bought this product because most sunscreens irritate my under eye area. This one didn‚Äôt but if you already have a sunscreen that works for you and that doesn‚Äôt make your eyes watery, then you don‚Äôt need this one. It‚Äôs too expensive for what it is. I‚Äôm still giving it a 4/5 since it did work for me but I just wouldn‚Äôt repurchase it."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,"i really enjoy this eye cream. it‚Äôs great to use during the day, for its obvious sun protection benefit and it being lightweight. i have super oily skin and haven‚Äôt found it to run into my eyes throughout the day, which is a plus (rare for me). you need to warm the product up between your ring fingers before applying and tap to apply instead of rub. i have not experienced any pilling when i do both of the aforementioned steps. there is a bit of a tint that illuminates the eyes but it is a bit shimmery so keep that in mind. make sure to tap it out well at the edges so there is no harsh line between the eye cream and the rest of your face."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Unique Product, Brightens Around Eyes","I've been using this excellent eye area SPF for a year now. A little goes a very long way. A daily staple. On relaxed days, I don't even use an eyeshadow primer with it - and my light eyeshadow still stays put. I do use a 2nd eye cream with it, as this one is on the thicker side to spread. My dark circles are less noticeable. All in all, great."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,LOVE IT,This is exactly what I needed. I‚Äôm really happy with this product. I will definitely buy it again.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Gross and unnecessary,"This stuff is AWFUL. It pills up when you put it on, so already it's a hard no, but it's also unnecessary. It doesn't do anything for the care/texture/firmness/brightness of your periorbital area, it's literally just tinted, sparkly sunscreen. You're better off using an eye gel/cream that actually does something and then just applying a sunscreen liberally as the final step all over your face, neck, and chest, including eye area (which is what you should be doing anyway)."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,I‚Äôve been trying a lot of sunscreens after skin cancer diagnosis. This one doesn‚Äôt irritate my eye area and blends easily. I really like it so far. Spent a few hours in the sun and reapplied every two hours and no sun burn.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,"I like the product but the packaging is bad. Every morning there is a dried chunk of product in the tip of the dispenser, making application a pain because you have to fish out the dry chunk. The dried bit is equivalent to my daily product dosage, so I‚Äôm wasting half the product due to poor packaging."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,dissatisfied,I wish this came in better packaging because the product doesn‚Äôt always come out with the same consistency. If I pump out only the amount that I need then it‚Äôs watery but if I pump out more then I get the true creamy consistency but then I have to waste product. This eye cream was also not as moisturizing as I had hoped so if you‚Äôre dry around the eyes beware
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Too thick, too expensive","I feel the consistency is way too thick for an eye cream, as it takes a lot to blend it in. I do like the pigmentation that brightens up the eye area and serves as a concealer. However, I find it doesn‚Äôt layer well with other eye makeup as it‚Äôll clump and settle into fine lines. Pro of the SPF is that it provides protection and doesn‚Äôt sting the eyes, but for the price I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it. I‚Äôll be finishing the product because it was so expensive, but not repurchasing."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Too Thick and Dry to Blend Well,"This product is so thick and firm that it's nearly impossible to apply it without tugging and pulling at the eye area.  Considering this is the most delicate skin on our faces and we're supposed to avoid pulling and tugging at it, this product seems pretty counterintuitive.  It also doesn't blend well as it's on the dry side."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,SO good,"BAD packaging but overall a great product. I have oily skin and tend to use more more matte sunscreens that dry out my unde eye area and irritate it but this is gentle and brightening! It is thick and a slightly tinted and hydrates the under eye area without adding that oil slick look. A little goes a long way and I have not noticed any sort of pilling (both under eye and when I tried it out on my hand), but pilling depends on what other products you layer with it"
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,"Would recommend this absolutely anyone, it's light and provides the perfect amount of coverage for this very sensitive area!"
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,didn‚Äôt work for me,"This product confirmed for me that my skin simply can‚Äôt tolerate zinc. I have to use a chemical sunscreen on my face to avoid irritation and dryness but I always felt bad that my eyes were left unprotected. I thought I‚Äôd give this a try as it‚Äôs the only eye cream I could find with SPF. I thought the tint was great, it really brightened my eyes and it even had a little sheen to it to make my eyes pop. A few hours later this felt drying, heavy and irritating. I ended up rubbing my eyes because of the irritation and the product came off my eyes in large pills. I can‚Äôt imagine that this would work under makeup whatsoever. However if your skin can tolerate zinc I would recommend this for the beach but not much else."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Terrible pump, but good product.",I would have loved this except for the pump.  It is impossible to dispense a small amount for eyes.  I ended up wasting so much product and decided to return because of that reason.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Absolutely love this product and will keep buying! At first I thought it was really thick but I am used to it now and it doesn‚Äôt bother me. If you don‚Äôt use a full pump a little bit remains in the dispenser and you get a hard little plug of product but if you use a full pump the dispenser is emptied and the next time you pump some out you don‚Äôt have the hard plug. The brightening effect is great! I don‚Äôt use concealer or anything under my eyes but I love the brightening. It‚Äôs not too much - at first it looks very light but then it soaks in a bit and looks more natural. I love that I can still feel the cream on my eye area hours later after applying. Keeps my eye area moisturized all day! My eyes are extremely sensitive to sunscreen and if the sunscreen gets too close my eyes burn so badly - so usually in the summer I have to choose sunburn or eye burning from the spf. This product allows me to get right up to the edge of my eye lids and there is no burning! Love it!
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Nice product terrible packaging,I use this after my eye cream in the mornings before I leave the house. I like that it‚Äôs not oily or leaves any white residue. However the packaging and dispenser head has a terrible design. Every time I push down a big blub of product squirts out all over the place. So much more than I need which means a lot of product waste. Fix the head pump supergoop!
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Too thick, doesn‚Äôt spread, pills easily","I am a longtime Supergoop customer and used their prior version of eye sunscreen and loved it‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt tinted and the consistency was like regular sunscreen, so easy to apply. But this stuff...I have had it for almost a year and y‚Äôall, I have tried everything‚Äîwarm it up between my fingers before applying, wait half an hour after applying moisturizer to apply sunscreen, etc etc. The consistency is so thick that it is incredibly difficult to spread...which means you have to pull at your delicate skin around the eye to try and make it work...which is not what eye creams are about, y‚Äôall! It also pills really easily. I just waited a full hour after vitamin c application in order to put this on, and even still, the pulling is awful. I am bummed this didn‚Äôt work out."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,I like the premise of this product and it does have a brightening effect. But with mature eyes it just settles into creases and game my eye area a too dry look. I will continue to look for a lore moisturizing eye cream.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,"I like it as an eye sunscreen. Although it has a beige tint, it does not have color payoff or provide coverage. They don‚Äôt claim this in the description, but it‚Äôs worth mentioning, because photos of the product imply it. I don‚Äôt see noticeable brightening. It us true what other reviewers have said about the pump making it difficult to use a precise amount. I like it as a sunscreen, but I‚Äôll probably return to a less expensive one."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Pretty good! Less Creasing Would Give it 5 Stars,"LOVE that I can put this near eyes. That area is such a sensitive, line prone area that needs sun protection, but often can't really get it. Thanks, Supergoop, for making one that can go there without the constant eye-watering or stinging. Eye makeup tends to move around on my lids by the end of the day. If you're the same way, I'd advise that if you're not going to wear powder eyeshadow over it, dust it with translucent face powder, or it will crease. More of an aesthetic issue than anything else."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,pills like crazy,"I really wanted to like this. However, about ten minutes after I put it on its creasing and pilling all around my eyes. I‚Äôve tried using less, more, everything but it basically runs away within minutes. So disappointed but I would not recommend."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Does not work on medium toned skin. Only on white skin. Do not like it or recommend it.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Lightly hydrating,"Very nice mineral eye cream for daytime use. It does leave a brightening effect, and a very slight  cast. On my fair skin it's not very noticeable; it just looks like a sheen. Slightly hydrating and works well underneath makeup."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,does what it says it does!,"I can't have chemical SPFs near my eyes because my eyes are so sensitive, so this is perfect for me. 

This stuff has a light beigey color that brightens the eye area, plus it is nice and creamy, and most importantly, protects against sun damage. 

(I can't say what it would look like on darker skin, but it isn't like concealer -- it doesn't provide actual coverage, it's more like a cream with color mixed in so it blends into your skin, so it *might* work to brighten up the eye area no matter skin tone.)"
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,I love love this product!,My go to AM eye cream. It blends nicely with my ring finger covering my dark puffy circles and at the same time making them nice and bright.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Irritating,Skip this one. It is a gimmicky product that is not for sensitive skin. It irritates my skin and eyes and that is where it is intended to be. I should have returned but now I have to toss it.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Good product, do not like pump dispenser","Really like product but a lot is wasted with the packaging - if you use a full pump‚Äôs worth, it is way too much, and if you pump for only a little you get a gob of hardened product within the drop that you need. I use over very lightly applied moisturizer and just pat this on -if you rub it will pill up. I use this for everyday, would not use for the beach as reapplying also results in pilling up.
Would much rather this be in a tube; you could just get the amount you needed and it would fit easier into a 3-1-1 bag that way also.
I did not find this to be iridescent or otherwise weird looking on my fair skin/undereye circles, blends right in tone-wise."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,This is...weird. It's a pinkish color that does an okay job covering up dark circles under the eye. The consistency is so strange though. It's deceptively thick and feels uncomfortable on.  \The eye cream started piling and flaking off as I was applying the face sunscreen! I 10/10 will not buy again.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Doesnt sting my eyes and would buy again for that reason. Did not pill on me and blended in fine. It has a slight tint that is a bit brightening but I imagine it may leave a cast for darker skin tones. If your normal face sunscreen doesnt bother your eyes I dont think you need it.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,not so great,"I was excited about this product because the eyes need extra tlc when it comes to spf. The consistency made the application difficult... it didn‚Äôt feel like it absorbed and it left me tugging at my eye skin to blend which is a no no. If the product was a thinner consistency it may be better, but for me this is a no."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Just No,Awful. Had high hopes for this. It doesn‚Äôt blend and leaves a white chalky residue all over. Dries before you can even blend it in.
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,I love it,"Blown away by how incredible this was. A little bit goes a loooong! If you use a lot it can flake/cake - but if you use a reasonable amount it brightens your under eye for the days you want to wear nothing but sunscreen. Love that. Can‚Äôt say how it works under makeup though, because I typically only wear this if I‚Äôm not going to be wearing makeup"
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Amazing,"Amazing under eye spf,I see some people have problem with skin flaking etc,your skin is probably dehydrated and it has nothing to do with you drinking water,drinking water itself is not going to help your skin if you‚Äôre not properly taking care of it with the right skin care regimen"
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Feels pasty thick,"Really like the concept of this product. Not sure whether I‚Äôll buy it again though because the formulation is so pasty thick and unfriendly, I find myself kind of avoiding it due to other products I use around my eye area having some SPF in it. It sits on my eye area skin in a way that feels very distracting.  If the formulation becomes less thick I would definitely buy it again."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Too Heavy,"I really wanted to like this product because it‚Äôs so hard to find a sunscreen that doesn‚Äôt sting the eye area. You have to use a really tiny amount because it‚Äôs mineral based and the particles don‚Äôt really sink into the skin, so it just sits on top. It made my eye lids feel heavy and only after I wash my face do I feel more at ease. It has a peachy tone so does help with brightening the eye area but sadly it‚Äôs not for me. Will use it finish but will not repurchase."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,brightens eye area,"This really helps to brighten my eye area and I love that it has spf protection. However the pump can be improved, many times I pump too much product out and it seems like a waste. "
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Supergoop Bright-Eye ,"Sunscreen for eyes are hard to find so I'm glad to find this however, it dries out and get hardened after using it for a couple of months which makes application and blending harder."
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,so nice so lovely,"This isn‚Äôt just a sunscreen for eyes. It‚Äôs also an eye primer. It‚Äôs so lovely and so nice!! A bottle lasted me 10 months. The only downside is the cream will dried n hardened towards don‚Äôt know how many months after I first use it. So, yeah‚Ä¶ kinda unhappy with that part. The rest are all good. When u put sunscreen on your face, pls don‚Äôt forget sunscreen on your eyes after eye cream ;)"
SUPERGOOP!-Bright-Eyed 100% Mineral Eye Cream SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Supergoop,"First of all, this is eye cream for day time with spf, i like to apply bcoz its not sticky when apply, Smell nice and not bad on my skin, worth it to try it when there got promotion! Recommended. "
DR. DENNIS GROSS-All-Physical Lightweight Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 PA++++,Singapore,Lightweight,Really feels lightweight and easy to apply smoothly. Not oily afterward. I like that Dr Dennis Gross products are Cruelty-free! I don‚Äôt want to use skincare products at the cost of innocent animals. 
DR. DENNIS GROSS-All-Physical Lightweight Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 PA++++,Malaysia,Good but pricey,"Works really well under makeup, with a lightly moisturising texture. Those with oily skin may not like this product. Only wished it was at least SPF 50 for the price."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-All-Physical Lightweight Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 PA++++,Singapore,good for a combination skin,"This is really good for the face. My face ahs a combination skin. Lots of products I used, gave me an oily tone after applying and also after being in the sun, but this doesn't did so, have to re‚Äêapply after 2 or 3 hours for best results in my experience. "
DR. DENNIS GROSS-All-Physical Lightweight Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 PA++++,Singapore,worst of all,"I have tried so any SPF, this is the worst. It doesn‚Äôt stay, cause breakout and despite foundation or setting powder; the shine appear within 45 minutes. It‚Äôs disgusting "
DR. DENNIS GROSS-All-Physical Lightweight Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 PA++++,Singapore,decent,"I was looking for a physical sunblock that could block out blue light on top of the usual UVA uvb and chanced upon this. I have dry combi skin and after applying this, it leaves no white cast and did moisturize my skin. And I'm glad I'm being protected from the blue light from constantly using my phone. However, it leaves behind a shine which I have to dab on my loose powder in order to remove it. I doubt this may be suitable for oily skin? "
DR. DENNIS GROSS-All-Physical Lightweight Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 PA++++,Singapore,ok,"This is ok‚Ä¶ it has no scent which is good but the white cast is very much visible even though I think I am quite fair so I think must reconsider if want to buy , got other sunscreen better"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-All-Physical Lightweight Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 PA++++,Singapore,Perfection,Glides easily on my face & provides a dewy finish. Appreciate that there‚Äôs blue light coverage on top of sun protection. Product is a bit on the pricier side but a little goes a long way. 
DR. DENNIS GROSS-All-Physical Lightweight Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 PA++++,Malaysia,Best Sunscreen ,"So far I have found a sunscreen that will not cause any extra pimple and it's easy application. So smooth. 

The best part is that it doesn't have white cast although it also gives a tone up look.

Still double cleanse, else it will come out unwanted pimple. "
DR. DENNIS GROSS-All-Physical Lightweight Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 PA++++,Malaysia,Good,"As a first timer to this physical sunscreen, so far no regrets. Love the texture lightweight and oil free. It doesn‚Äôt leave a greasy mess and white cast on my face."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-All-Physical Lightweight Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 PA++++,Singapore,a recommended sunscreen ,bought it from a recommendation by the staff. been good on my skin and gives a refreshing feeling. Been using for few months now and Will purchase again 
DR. DENNIS GROSS-All-Physical Lightweight Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 PA++++,Singapore,feels like a Korean sunscreen ,Lightweight and easily absorbed to the skin. Doesn‚Äôt give any a Matt or dewy finish to the skin. Consistency is just right not too watery that it will slip off your fingers and not too thick to rub it in your skin. Don‚Äôt think it has any scent. Does it‚Äôs job well as a sunscreen 
DR. DENNIS GROSS-All-Physical Lightweight Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 PA++++,Philippines,makes oily skin shinier and oilier,"Bought this due to hyped reviews and ingredients, While this is easy to blend, the finish leaves my face superrr shiny and oily, I didn‚Äôt even apply any moisturizer before this, definitely can‚Äôt be used alone without powder if you have oily skin, I am thinking might be better under make up, the plastic-y smell is quiet strong and lingers for a while, I personally think this is more suitable for dry skin"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-All-Physical Lightweight Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 PA++++,Malaysia,Would definitely repurchase again!,"The first time I applied this on my face I could immediately feel that this was a hit! It did not feel thick and heavy on my skin. It absorbed pretty well and felt like I did not put anything on my face. However, I have not tried applying makeup on top of it so I cannot attest to it in that aspect. I just wished it has a higher SPF, but I guess this is the reason why it felt more lightweight on the skin."
DR. DENNIS GROSS-All-Physical Lightweight Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 PA++++,Singapore,Quality sunscreen ,This is a beautifully smooth daily sunscreen with a texture that‚Äôs better than Supergoop. It layers well with other products and doesn‚Äôt leave too much of a white cast. Great stuff.
DR. DENNIS GROSS-All-Physical Lightweight Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 PA++++,Singapore,Love It!,It's light weight and no tacky feeling. Doesn't make my oily skin look shiny or oily.  Works perfectly under my makeup. Just love it!  And I will definitely repurchase! 
DR. DENNIS GROSS-All-Physical Lightweight Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 PA++++,Malaysia,Physical Sunscreen,"This is my first physical sunscreen that I have tried. I love the formula is super lightweight and didnt leave any whitecast. This product is vegan, cruelty-free, reef safe, and clean at Sephora and comes in recyclable packaging. Everyone should try this sunscreen!"
DR. DENNIS GROSS-All-Physical Lightweight Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 PA++++,Singapore,Ms ,"Does not pill. Has a nutty grainy scent that reminds me of barley. Is moisturizing enough and there is no need for an additional moisturizer, especially if I am not going to be in an air-conditioned place for too long. If I use sparingly, no white cast. However for more protection, I usually slather it on and that leave a mild white cast (I‚Äôve had worse before). "
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,Singapore,stings my eyes ,"This has a lovely moisturizing creamy finish. I can see dry skins and normal skins liking this to even replace both moisturizer and sunscreen. However I do a thorough job with sunscreen and that includes applying around my eyes (not too close) but if I so much as perspire, any sweat that goes into my eye with the sunscreen would sing it like crazy. I‚Äôm finishing it and using it only for my neck and chest. "
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Terrible,"Have tried to make this work so many times - gonna declutter because it makes me sad seeing it in my collection. Product is oily, leaves the skin looking greasy, separates and enhances texture."
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,mr,love the consistency of this sun block. its quite light and doesnt give the greasy and shiny effect on my skin. nice to be used everyday. would be repurchasing this. love love love
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,It is ok,Bought it at the discounted price to try. It is oily after half day application. The pump is not really working. The mixture is not well mixed. Sometime only pump out the oil.
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Might buy if there is a discount,"Does its job as a day moisturiser, does not feel too heavy on the skin. I like that the moisturiser is dispensed via a pump, it feels more hygienic this way. "
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,non sticky and light weight,bought this during halloween sale and its pretty  suitable for my skin. non tacky and no color transference. my make up went on well. theres no cosmetic smell either.
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Protection and hydration in one,"A light moisturizer which gives me enough hydration with fast absorption.   It comes with an SPF30 broad spectrum UVA/UVB protection, which is the least number of SPF that we should use these days. Love this product."
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Good moisturizer and sun protection in one,This Works really works! In Transit Skin Defense is a good moisturizer. It temporarily makes my wrinkle disappear.  The texture is neither too rich nor too watery. Seems effective for sun protection too.
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,this works -not ,Texture is hard to apply and for some reason this stings my eyes really badly when I sweat (my other products don‚Äôt sting me til there are tears). Also abit icky on skin. Not for me. 
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Travel size,I put this in my bag because i always use after praying while im outside because i hv dry skin and i need spf at the same time. The texture is good enough for me. For daily use i dont really recommend because as far as im using it i didnt see any improvements. Just maintining your skin. 
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,works! ,I use it as mositurisor plus spf. The moisturisor is lightweight and sunscreen does not carry a scent. i applied serum underneath so it works well for me. non sticky so it doesnt affect my make subsequently.
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,everyday use,"I use it every single day in the morning. Although I apply sunscreen daily, I also think it is a good idea to use a moisturiser with SPF to protect your skin. It is hydrating in Knouff for our normal weather. But if you are looking for extra hydration I would suggest you use a more powerful Meister Isa"
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Love it,"I really like this sunblock, absorbs well and was not greasy. Bought it during promotion and it was a quite a steal. Will buy it again when there is promo as the original price is a tad pricey for the volume."
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,meh,"I find that this product separates so it can get oily when pumped out. Also it has a smell that i dont appreciate. Lastly, it feels really oily when applied to the skin so i dont recommend this. However i think it does its job as a sunscreen so thats that. "
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,love it!,Love this product. I use this after my gym sessions after bath and it is very convenient given that it is a moisturizer coupled with sunblock. It does not sting my face and is easy to spread it across the face. 
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Fav duo product,"This is a really good product and its worth the buy! It is really hydrating and will not feel heavy on the skin.. Doesn't clog the pores... Whenever I have dry patches or break out during the time of the month, this one saves the day!

"
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Good buy!,"Saves me the time to apply moisturiser and sun block all at one. It is a bit oily, but bearable. One pump is all I need. Pleasant smell. Consistency and texture is perfect. Does not clump nor feel sticky after application, but seems to be a bit oily. "
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,One of the Best,"I use this everyday and for my kids as well. It's a great product - light but moisturises well. I have dry skin so this allows me to skip a step in the routine.¬†
I'm on my third bottle now and cannot imagine moving away from this product."
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Compact product + light on my skin ,"I like this product, it's a good moisturizer, light and absorbs quickly, and MOST importantly, does not break me out, which was exactly what I was looking for hence it gets four stars from me. I use it after the gym, and it's compact size is a real plus as it is easy to carry around. Does it do anything extraordinary for my skin? Nope. It's not special like that, I've used better products. If you're looking for something basic and compact, this is it though. The only issue I had when I first started using it, was the scent, which was medicinal. However, I got over it eventually as it serves my purpose.¬†

"
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Not for me,"I loved the first two This Works products I tried, namely, Clean Skin Gentle Cleanser and In Transit Camera Closeup, so I decided to give this one a try. I'm always looking for products with good sun protection and sadly, this one didn't end up being on my favorites list. It was mainly the scent that turned me off. It has a strong ""plastic"" scent that lingers for quite a bit after application but eventually wears off. While the texture is light upon application, I noticed that it tends to make me oily after just a few hours. I really wanted to love this but sadly, it just wasn't for me. :("
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Best Moisturiser & Sunblock in One! Perfect for humid sunny weather! ,"This Works - In transit skin defence is absolutely wonderful!¬†

Great value for money and great SPF for everyday use.¬†

What is there to love about this product? For one contains UVA/UVB broad spectrum sun protection, so its perfect for everyday use in tropical countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.¬†

The texture is so light and it not greasy or tacky (which I absolutely hate). It great to wear under foundation and doesn't make it cakey.¬†

This product did not break me out and as I have sensitive, and acne prone skin and it's an absolute bonus!¬†"
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Love it!,I bought this hearing a lot of geeat reviews and I'm not disappointed. I have dry skin and the mosturising effect along with the sunscreen is very effective. It doesn't leave a whitness like a lot of sunscreens. I often wear it and skip makeup all together!
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Pretty good,I use this with the Perfect Look Skin Miracle - the tint moisturiser without SPF. Both together give a nice glossy look. Doesn't feel thick though 2 layers on. I like this brand for the natural stuff in the products.¬†
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Not as good as expected,"After reading review from others and having it being from ""this works"" i expected this sunblock to be less oily and not make my t zone oilier. But i was so disappointed with this product. I find it a little too sticky and difficult to absorb. Most likely will not get it again."
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Does it job at moisturizing and sun screening,"It feels sticky and greasy when it's hot and humid outside, but indoors with air conditioning, it feels like you're not wearing anything at all. One or two pumps is enough to cover the face -- three is too much, especially in humid climes. And humidity also makes it melt down your face -- especially painful when it gets into your eyes. In short, if you live in a hot and humid place, it might be better to use a different moisturizer."
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,In transit skin defence,The consistency is not too heavy and has a bit of that sunscreen smell but I've gotten used to it and quite like the smell now. It doesn't control oil as well as my previous sunscreen from Shiseido. So far so good and it doesn't break me out.
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Great product!,"This is my 2nd purchase as i love this SPF face cream so much, its considered light-weight and not greasy, also won't give you a 'white mask' kind of look after apply it on the face. Great to use as a make up base since its hydrating and with SPF. Love the herbal scent as well.¬†"
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,The smell though ... ,The moisturiser was alright and definitely more fuss free with the SPF. I found the packaging quite hygienic which is a plus as it's a pump! My only gripe about this is the smell which wears off after a while but ... it smelled like sunscreen mixed with something foul.
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Not bad ,I bought this during Luxola sale right before my overseas trips. I use it more as a sunscreen for my face and neck as it doesn't really moisturise as advertised. (My face still feels dry when in plane) One good thing is that it doesn't turn my skin white after application like most sunscreens in the market. Works well as a base before my makeup.¬†
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Good for dry skin,My skin is very dry and this 2 in 1 sunscreen is really nourishing my dry skin. I just pat a layer of loose powder to mattify the shine a bit and good to go. But not recommend it if you have oily skin cause it is very moisturing.
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Perfect for lazy people,"I worry about premature wrinkling and ageing especially on my face, and like the saying goes: Prevention is better than cure. So I decided to purchase this moisturizer and use it religiously (I try). I like how this product is vegan, means no animals were harmed, and I like how light it feels on my face after applying. There's a unique smell on this product though, nothing fruity or floral, just my 2 cents."
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Not that phenomenal,"Moisturizing and not leave a white cast, I suppose that's all I could say for the product. I believe the price is for the noncomedogenic ingredients and not too many chemicals, because if not, it's quite an overpriced sunscreen. Cute packaging though."
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Thumbs up,"I have used many, many face sunblocks and this is one of the better ones. It is a little moisturising and dries clear. The pump makes it easy and hygienic to use. I chose it mainly because it is a animal cruelty-free product. I would re-purchase.¬†"
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Tops!,"This ranks high on the list of products I would love to stock up on. It goes on smoothly, there is no stickiness and it is just sooooo light....

Highly recommended if you are travelling light and cannot afford the extra space to put in both a moisturiser and a sunblock. This two-in-one will serve you well.¬†

Also recommended for guys/ gals who don't like to stack on products or enjoy the feel of going commando/barely-there!¬†"
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Convenient,"Not oily, adequately hydrating. Fluid gets absorbed into the skin quickly without leaving any residue. A word of caution - if you apply this product and happen to sweat profusely later, you may experience some stinging in the eyes (as with any other sunscreen products).¬†"
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,perfect for my lazy day !!,"This is my first product from This Works brand !!
what I super love about this is that it is not sticky, moisturizer with SPF added in it.

For my lazy days (which are most of the time) I can just put toner this, and then go out immediately. The price and product is perfect <3 super love and will definitely repurchase.

Thank you Luxola and This works :)"
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Great product,"This cult brand works. Thought a little on the expensive side, it's great when you purchase it on sale. Im ¬†not too sure how effective is the SPF though. However, it works good as a makeup base and it does feel moisturising.¬†"
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Just like a moisturizer,"I was looking for a moisturizer cum sunscreen for the face as I didn't wanna put so much products in the morning / during the day, so I ordered one since the review was pretty good.¬†
So basically the texture is slightly thicker than a moisturizer but it is not oily. The scent is a tad like sunscreen but you will get used to it. Good purchase."
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,my hassle-free morning skincare,"I'm not a fan of the too-many-steps face regimen, so this product fits me well. It has a light texture for an spf product, non sticky or oily, has a wonderful smell, absorb quickly and hydrates very well. leave my skin soft and protected.¬†made my morning hassle-free. love this."
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Smooth and no SPF smell,"This is a good basic SPF moisturiser for the day. I hate wearing sunscreen during work hours because the smell is quite strong, and the texture is often too creamy for me. This is a really nice light textured moisturiser, and doesn't smell of sun cream. The packaging could be improved to 50ml as I find there are a lot of other products in the same price range which offer the 10ml extra."
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Good Product,"Quite expensive for the amount you get but it is good for sensitive skin, moisturises well and leaves my skin feeling soft. Is also a good make-up base but I admit that it makes my skin (I have dry cheeks and an oily t-zone) very shiny after a few hours. Also sad that it's supposed to be reapplied every few hours but it's a good product if you need a basic SPF moisturiser!¬†"
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,decent ,"I am searching for a physical sunscreen with decent spf, more natural ingredients and non-oliy finish. I think this product meet all the requirements for a sunscreen. Because it is not oily, you need to apply moisturizer under it. BTY, it can be removed easily which is a plus.
"
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Absorbs well!,"This is one of the better sunscreens I have used thus far. It absorbs well into the skin. This is definitely suitable for Singapore hot and humid weather. Can't comment how effective it is though.¬†

Recommended! Give it a shot!"
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,so so,"I find it just a normal moisturizer with uv protection. It is not too oily nor too dry, and has no strong smell, works as what it is supposed to be but I probably won't go back for it again. will try another brand."
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Feels like a sunblock and is one,"You know when you squeeze out from a Nivea moisturizer bottle and go, ""it looks like milk."" Well, it is the same with this sunblock and moisturizer rolled into one. It doesn't make your skin feel heavy or gluey even thought I applied it after the ""in transit camera close-up"". The sun is really doing crazily these days, so better protect yourself before it is too late. "
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,My current favourite sunscreen,"Smells way better than your average sunscreen and doesn't have that sticky, oily feel. And the pump bottle is very easy to use and mess free.
¬†I am coming to love This Works products a lot! So glad I picked this up from the 30% sale!¬†"
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Lightweight Moisturiser!,In need of SPF coverage for my face. This is a great buy! Love the scent and the light texture. Leaving your skin feeling soft and protected. Will definitely buy again when it runs out! Highly recommended for those having Sensitive skin. This works for me!¬†
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Good moisturizer.,I bought this moisturizer because it comes with SPF. I use it over my SK II stempower and they work well together for my sensitive skin when I'm out in the sun for long. It is not sticky and is very light. Will repurchase!
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Love!,"I'm in love with this moisturizer! I think it's a perfect blend of moisturizer and SPF! The smell is awesome(mild and not strongly scented) and the packaging in genius! I like that it's so handy and it's just moist enough for my combination skin. It is a basic moisturizer SPF though, so if you want more added properties, use a serum."
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Bad purchase,"I'm put off by the smell! After application, I didn't break out.. BUT as a 2-in-1, the moisturizer didn't work! My skin dried out. I think feels more of a sunblock than a moisturizer. It's quite thick and oily to apply, I had to set it or I'd be walking out with so much shimmer on my face its enough to fry an egg. Packaging wise, its not as convenient as they've mentioned! Maybe to fly but it's still too big to travel around with (Though with that size, it's considered more affordable/ worth it.) It couldn't stand on my vanity table. No to smell, no to application and no to packaging. Upset with this purchase! :( Can I return this please, Luxola??¬†"
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,"Finally, an SPF moisturizer without the Oily feel!","Finally, a moisturizer with SPF but without the ""oily"" feel! Encouraged by the successful trial of 2 other In Transit products, i decided to go for my 3rd In Transit product and again, this brand did not disappoint me. I did not develop any breakouts. It does not feel ""hot"" on the skin. It does not feel oily nor heavy. I would say it really suits my combination skin in the humid Singapore climate."
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,The Best SPF & Moisturizer ,I'm instantly loving this product! It doesn't give you a white streak like any other SPF products. The texture is very light so it absorbs to your skin nicely. It's not greasy and it can be a perfect base to put under your makeup. I can feel that it really works as a moisturizer and hydrates the skin very well. I'm definitely going to purchase it! Highly recommended..
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,moisturizing and protecting,"a bit afraid at first because I thought this will make my skin feel greasy, but it's not! easily absorbed and left my skin feeling soft. I used this as my everyday SPF and lotion. You should get this if you've been looking for moisturizer lotion with SPF.¬†"
THIS WORKS-In Transit Skin Defence SPF30,,Great sunblock,"This sunblock is easy to apply and can also be applied over makeup easily. It feels moisturising and does not dry up my skin (although my skin tends to be oily). I am still testing it for its anti-aging and anti-oxidation effects but these are still early days. At the moment, I think this is a great buy as it is not greasy and is relatively cheaper compared to other brands. "
SHISEIDO-Clear Stick UV Protector SPF 50+ PA++++,Singapore,Buy this!,"Bought the male one cause the female one ran out of stock. Anyways, I read reviews that said the female one has lesser product inside. Not sure though. But I am sure that this product works well regardless of which gender it was supposed to be marketed to."
SHISEIDO-Clear Stick UV Protector SPF 50+ PA++++,Singapore,NICE PRODUCT ,"Even though it has a bit of scent, i like it very much. Easy to use and nice size to put in the bag. My go to product!!! I recommend buying this although it‚Äôs a men product "
SHISEIDO-Clear Stick UV Protector SPF 50+ PA++++,Singapore,manager,"Very easy to glide, non sticky, light weight, in fact didn‚Äôt feel anything after application. Not really scented. Yes, I used it for myself instead of giving to my son. Haha"
SHISEIDO-Clear Stick UV Protector SPF 50+ PA++++,Singapore,more worth it than the woman's version,"this is essentially the exact same product as the blue pacakaging one marketed towards women. its costs the same, but contains more product, so buy this."
LANEIGE-Radian-C Sun Cream SPF50+ PA++++,Singapore,Laneige,First time try this product..for face is ok.maybe my skin very sensitive.my eyes feels want to close don‚Äôt want to open and and tears keep come out‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..not i only use it for neck and arm‚Ä¶..
LANEIGE-Radian-C Sun Cream SPF50+ PA++++,Singapore,mixed feelings about this,"i don't like it but i don't hate it either.. it's good because it gives you that dewy glow and it doesn't take much time to blend in if you're in a rush. problem is the string citrus smell.. it does go away after awhile but wow it hits you when you first put it on. and for the price, i thought it would have been a bit bigger and the pump makes it a little hard to get two fingers worth. i know it's a hit for some people but it's a miss for me. i wanted to love it but i guess it's just not for me. might go back to super goop"
LANEIGE-Radian-C Sun Cream SPF50+ PA++++,Singapore,sun cream,This sun cream has really  light weight firmula. It leaves no white residue. Its not sticky so can put makeup over it. This is my second time buying this product. Its perfect for hot n humid weather.
DERMALOGICA-Invisible Physical Defense SPF30,Singapore,invisible physical defense spf30,"bought this because it was highly recommended by Susan yara on YouTube but I didn't like it at all. I would prefer a more creamy/watery consistency. this sun screen was thick, leaves a white cast and takes awhile to blend out because of its thick consistency and it broke me out. sorely disappointed. for the price, you can get better sunscreens elsewhere."
SUPERGOOP!-Lipscreen SPF 40,Singapore,Interesting product,"Was excited to get a lip sunscreen when I found supergoop‚Äôs. The downside for me is that when I apply too much of it,it‚Äôs bitter and has this taste in my mouth.You have to apply an appropriate amount yet not knowing if it‚Äôs enough for sun protection."
SUPERGOOP!-Lipscreen SPF 40,Vietnam,It tastes terrible. Don't buy it girl.,"The title says it all. Even though I read reviews from other people saying it tasted bad, I still purchased it because of various reasons (how it can block the suncreen etc.). 

And I was wrong. After applying it, everything was fine until I drank water. I could taste it immediately.

I can't say if this product works wonder, but the taste is so so bad and I hate it.

The only pro about it is that it gives you that shiny look, when combined with a chemical sunscreen.

Won't buy it again."
SUPERGOOP!-Lipscreen SPF 40,Singapore,lipscreen ,Don‚Äôt mind the texture is ok for me. Gives some moisture to my dry lips. Will make a point to use it in my day time skin care/make up ritual. I am a Supergoop fan 
SUPERGOOP!-Lipscreen SPF 40,Singapore,Lips,"Nourishing and smooth, this lightweight formula glides over lips (one of our most sun-sensitive areas!) to leave a natural, moisturized finish while helping to protect against sun damage and environmental aggressors. Swipe on throughout the day for soft, healthy-looking lips!"
SUPERGOOP!-Lipscreen SPF 40,Singapore,Surprisingly good,I read the reviews and give it a try anyways. I don't really know how a sunscreen taste or smell like but this lip sunscreen smells nice like vanilla to me. Quite similar to the Fenty lip gloss scent but a little milder. It's like a transparent lip gloss with a wand applicator. It doesn't taste of anything. Just a nice light vanilla scent. I enjoy this much more than I expected. Really happy to have tried it. Might consider repurchase in future.
SUPERGOOP!-Lipscreen SPF 40,Singapore,lipscreen SPF 40,"Disappointed because I was so excited to use it and the outcome. Delivery is quite delay and that makes me feel excited and eager to use it. But when it arrived, it was spoilt. No brush on the tip. But the customer service is so kind to give me my refund by giving voucher."
SUPERGOOP!-Lipscreen SPF 40,Singapore,One word: regret,"First of all, it feels like I am eating a grandma‚Äôs fragranced face cream the moment I apply this lip product. The smell of this lip screen is strong and lingering. And it is hard to prevent from going into the mouth because, well, it is a lip product, but also because it is quite liquidy. 
Secondly, on the tube it says ‚Äòif swallowed, get medical help or contact poison control center immediately‚Äô. Really? It‚Äôs a lip product, which means you ingest a little of it every time you wear it. 
Overall, unpleasant and disappointing. "
SUPERGOOP!-Lipscreen SPF 40,Singapore,Lipscreen SPF 40,"Great lip sunscreen to use before lipsticks or simply just wearing it alone, where you‚Äôre home or out and about! Doesn‚Äôt dry out my lips and in fact, keeps my lips moisturized and doesn‚Äôt crack when in an AC room. "
SUPERGOOP!-Lipscreen SPF 40,Singapore,Supergoop Lip screen,"Supergoop lip screen is a clear lip gloss that provides SPF40.It makes my lips very soft after  the application and protects  against the sun.I am very satisfied .

DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Tone-Up Sun Cushion,Australia,good but wouldn‚Äôt buy again ,I like the concept and the delivery method as it‚Äôs great for touch ups during the day if you have some makeup on already. Doesn‚Äôt give a white cast on my light-medium skin. But‚Ä¶ for the amount you get it‚Äôs a bit expensive and it should come with a refill on the first purchase. I know you can buy refills but it‚Äôs still too expensive 
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Tone-Up Sun Cushion,Australia,dear dahlia,really good and good size. loved the cute marble packaging. easy touch up. Would probably buy again. worked well with my skin and did the what it needed to do. 
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Tone-Up Sun Cushion,Australia,sun cushion,Feels luxurious and heavy but too bulky to carry around and also feels alittle sticky and leaves a white cast (only on initial application and gets better throughout wear). It is convenient with built in mirror and very soft puffer but white stickiness puts me off applying throughout the day. 
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Tone-Up Sun Cushion,Australia,I like it but..,"I do like this and the way that feels on my skin, it feels so soft... But, I do look like a ghost after applying it, it takes a while to the white colour fades a bit.. the smell kind reminds me that baby butt cream üòÇ"
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Tone-Up Sun Cushion,Australia,decent,this is an innovate sunscreen. it is mineral so it does leave a slight white cast which is expected. i have oily skin and I find I need to powder a bit
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Tone-Up Sun Cushion,Australia,white mark,"It feels good on skin, somehow it has a cooling effect  but the problem is it leaves white mark on skin..... ... skin end up looking uneven,especially if you have darker tone."
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Tone-Up Sun Cushion,Australia,great on the go sunscreem,"I have been looking for a sunscreen that you can use to top up during the day. something that can go over the top of makeup, when you are out and about, this is perfect. 

does not leave a white caste, sinks into the skin and comes in a foundation like cushion compact so if you are in the toilet easy to touch up on the go. "
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Tone-Up Sun Cushion,Malaysia,Beautiful cushion,Sun cushion is a very creative and new idea. Really easy to apply sunscreen. The texture create a glowy and moisture finish. Need set with powder after applied this cushiom for ppl with oily skin.
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Tone-Up Sun Cushion,Malaysia,this is the best tone up sun cushion,altho its expensive but for a reason...it makes my skin beautifully and as i know that im not putting any harsh camical tho my skin is sensitive...i would recomend this product for those who want to look more awake naturally without putting alot of makeup or just for your daily skin care rutine. the puff came with the product is so helpfull...just wear a bit on the face and fresh looking face everytime.
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Tone-Up Sun Cushion,Malaysia,I love it,"I received these products from Dear Dahlia, and I'm finally here to share about them with you guys!
Texture-wise, it's very watery and light, and very refreshing on the skin. It feels comfortable and is very easy to blend. "
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Tone-Up Sun Cushion,,Nice smelling with natural ingredients ,"It‚Äôs a decent sunscreen with natural ingredients. The application is a little like liquid foundation, initial white sheen fades into the skin, though I was hoping for more tone-up effect."
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Milky Bright SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,"Small, pricey but worth it",This product is not oily and the doesnt smell like normal sunscreen. Its quite light when u apply on your skin. The size is small and pricey but overall im so satisfied with this product and you dont have to apply so much on your skin. 
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Milky Bright SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,Great everyday sunblock,"Absorbs quickly, doesn‚Äôt leave an oily film and doesn‚Äôt smell strongly of sunblock. Also helps to even out my skin tone. Would repurchase if not so pricey"
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Milky Bright SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,great product ,This is my multiple repeated purchased. Item is on the pricier side but a little goes a really really long way. I love the texture of this and how easy it is to glide on. Thumbs up for this product!!
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Milky Bright SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,Pricey for a little tube,"I usually find sunblock too greasy. This formula is great for hot and humid weather. Tones up skin as well. Only downside is the price for a little tube, runs out quick."
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Milky Bright SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,love the texture ,This is my first Lancome sunblock. Love the texture and will purchase again!!!! Not oily after apply to the skin. Suitable for hot weather in Singapore. 
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Milky Bright SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,fair product but pricey ,"This sunscreen is my favourite, new, discovery of this year so far. It is very pleasing to use, and I‚Äôm sure many of you will appreciate it. It‚Äôs from the higher price shelf, one of the priciest sunscreens I have used in a while, but it feels luxurious on the skin.¬†"
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Clean Screen Sensitive Skinscreen SPF30,Singapore,Good product,Good product that is lightweight and absorbs easily. No sunburn on my cruise and exploration journey. Have tested the sunscreens with higher spf but those are sticky and harder to absorb by the skin. 
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Clean Screen Sensitive Skinscreen SPF30,Philippines,Not worth the hype,"Pros - feels comfortable on the skin, didn't make me breakout. 
Cons - makes my hair super rough even if just a little product touches my hair (never used a sunscreen that did this), takes a while to absorb into my skin, stains my face mask, leaves an ugly sheen on my face 
Bottomline - i prefer asian sunscreens. I will not repurchase this. "
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Clean Screen Sensitive Skinscreen SPF30,Singapore,Just horrible,"Let's see. First I appreciate that this is a fragrance and alcohol free sunscreen. However, it comes with a tint which is a real pain to blend out. It takes me about 10 mins and by that time, I get conscious about how much product is being transferred onto my fingertips. The white cast (I'm a medium to dark brown shade) doesn't disappear over time but kind of just stays put on your skin. It's not transfer proof either so I have to be careful when I'm wearing anything white. I'm down to finishing the tube and I'll never repurchase it again. "
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Clean Screen Sensitive Skinscreen SPF30,Malaysia,Smooth suncreen!,"I've always wanted a sunscreen that doesnt have an oily/greasy finish to it, and this one does the trick for my dry/sensitive skin!
Will be repurchasing soon!"
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Clean Screen Sensitive Skinscreen SPF30,Singapore,lovely texture,"Goes on like a light lotion, no white cast or any pasty drag. Very very impressed. Works well with my makeup. Happy that Sephora brought this brand in, I was planning to get it shipped from Australia so saved on shipping fees."
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Clean Screen Sensitive Skinscreen SPF30,Singapore,Slightly disappointed,Was looking for a thicker sunscreen and this is close to what I was looming for. Great protection but the reason for the 4 starts is due to the smell. it has a plastic smell. Does anyone have idea if it is supposed to smell this way? 
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Clean Screen Sensitive Skinscreen SPF30,Singapore,Nice sunscreen,"The texture of this spf is on the thicker, more opaque side, but it‚Äôs good for preventing burns especially if we‚Äôre applying these on children. We‚Äôll be using this one up and repurchase when necessary."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Philippines,it was so so,Love the packaging of this product. The consistency is ok but it leaves a white cast like any other sunscreen. I would reorder this if the other options of sunscreen from Supergoop is out of stock. 
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Best mineral sunscreen I have tried,"For being a mineral sunscreen, this is the best I have used! It still has that mineral feel of being a bit heavy and slight white cast look on my skin, but it's still the thinnest and most easily spreadable mineral sunscreen I have found so far. If you have to have a mineral sunscreen, this is a great one to have. I still prefer chemical sunscreens to this one, but while I have to wear mineral sunscreen for the time being I will continue to use this one. With this mineral sunscreen it feels a bit more drying on my dry skin so now I use moisturizer under my sunscreen as opposed to chemical sunscreens I have used that moisturize adequately on their own."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Singapore,Great! ,"I‚Äôve used 2 bottles of this sunscreen and it works fine! It gives me a brighter skin complexion. However, the only downside is the SPF count is low. So, multiple applications are needed especially for those who are staying in a hot and humid country"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Malaysia,will buy again,"I am someone who was looking for  a subscription that I could wear every day without having any white cast as I have brown skin color and this was the perfect sunscreen that I bought from Sephora and it really helped my skin to heal and it did not have any white cast, so I really like this sunscreen. It‚Äôs perfect for every day use even with or without make up."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,NOT 100% mineral sunscreen,"I bought this sunscreen after reviews from influencers and have been using it for over a year. It works just fine as any sunscreen does, however it smells quite weird straight out of the tube and can leave my skin with bumps needing extra exfoliation at the end of the day. I wondered why that was considering I have no issue with zinc oxide. Well, it's because it contains Butyloctyl Salicylate, which is just the unregulated version of octisalate, a common chemical sunscreen. Because it is unregulated there is no dose limit so no way to know how much is in it. I do appreciate that there is a high % of zinc oxide, however this is in no way a 100% mineral sunscreen as advertised."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,"Terrible, smells bad, cause breakouts, and peels!","This product is terrible! The smell is really bad and makes me feel uncomfortable to apply to my skin, the texture is weird and hard to smooth out on my skin.
Even worse, I started having break outs after using it, and it starts peeling in the middle of the day and make me look like I just got a lot dandruff on my face!
Absolutely the worse! Throwing it away and will not buy from this brand again!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Im haunting my bathroom,"I look grey after applying. The texture is okay, I don't look greasy but I look grey. I tried to rub it in, I waited 20 minutes for my skin to warm the product up but still look grey. I have to put moisturizer on top of it (making it less effective) to get some of my color back."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Singapore,Sheer Screen,Thankfully it worked on my skin. It gives a slight white Color but after a while it settles down. Another super goop face Sun screen thats worth the money. 
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"The best mineral sunscreen I‚Äôve used. It does leave some white cast when I first apply it, BUT it goes away or just get blended in my skin somehow. I don‚Äôt know how that works exactly, but my skin looks natural in 20-30 mins after applying. I have medium skin with a little olive tone. I saw some comments about it not working on darker skin though.
Most mineral sunscreens leave white cast, so if you don‚Äôt want any of that, you might want to look at chemical sunscreens. 
No piling issue for me."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,so far aMAZing,"I bought the mineral trial size kit. I've been in search of a mineral sunscreen that a) didn't irritate my skin and b) was easier to blend in/not leave a terrible caked on white cast that required me to put makeup over it to look like a human again. My face is all of a sudden mega sensitive to sunscreens and several that are high end mineral ones irritated it so much it itched and burned for days even after patch testing for a week. So I'm on day 3 of my patch testing now,wearing it on my forehead and half of my face and so far, no irritation! I love the application. Yes, it leaves a white/bluish cast for a minute as you put it on but it is minimal in comparison to most other mineral sunscreens. Also,it is easy to blend in and does not feel heavy. I'm going to push on with my 5-7 day of patch testing before I purchase full size but I have high hopes. I have not noticed the smell of it at all yet, makes me wonder if some people are getting older product that's starting to go bad, same with those who say it pills on them significantly. So far no pilling, but I have not put makeup over it as that was my first goal. SPF to throw on and walk the dog without a full face of makeup in 90 degree humid summer weather."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,perfectly light and smooth,"I think I've tried about every mineral sunscreen out there and this one wins. It's lightweight and does not irritate my dry, eczema prone skin. It seems to even out my competition a bit with no white cast. I lightly moisturizer first, finish getting ready and then apply this about 15 minute later. I feel protected and don't walk around feeling like I have a mask on my face. Yeah! Also, it doesn't travel and end up in my eyes or neck lines like others I've tried. It's a bit pricey but my skin is worth it!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Malaysia,ms,Sunscreen leaves whitecast. Needs longer time to absorb into oily skin. Has a strong fragrance. But does not make my skin breakout. A bit too pricey for a sunscreen which needs to be used daily.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Malaysia,Ms,I read facts about mineral sunscreen after I purchased this because I've tried 2 sunscreen from supergoop! before (Unseen & Glow). They doesn't burn my eyes if I accidentally rub my eye. Not recommended unless you test them at store
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Malaysia,Love it,"Love this sunscreen. It does leave a slight whitecast, but it goes away a few minutes after applying.  it goes well under my foundation. It doesn't make my skin feel oily. "
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,I received this product as a free sample and its smelled really weird when I used it on my face.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,I really wanted to love this product after a recommendation! It would be great if it didn‚Äôt leave a white cast. I am very tan so I won‚Äôt be using it any longer  Love all the ingredients regardless!
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"Adult Caucasian male. Love this sunscreen. Once it‚Äôs sat for a minute, the white cast goes away. Its the last step in my skincare routine. I do not wear makeup. This is a 5 star non-toxic sunscreen."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"I have oily combination skin. Finding a sunscreen can be difficult sometimes when all the sunscreens I‚Äôve tried have left me feeling so greasy and they leave a white cast. This sunscreen feels like you‚Äôre putting on a very light weight moisturizer and leaves 0 white cast. I 
will say it‚Äôs not my favorite smell only because I think it smells like peanut butter and I‚Äôm not a fan but everything else exceeds my expectations of a sun screen."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"No white cast, absorbed well, slightly funny smell. But I would choose this over the zinc screen and happy to have found a mineral sunscreen that feels more like a lotion!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,"Gets absorbed, no white cast on light brown skin","Been trying a lot of mineral sunscreens recently since Replenix discontinued my favorite one, and I really like this one. Surprisingly, despite the lack of tint, there is no white cast on my light brown skin (my tone is like Halle Berry). It gets absorbed nicely (after about 5 mins) and feels a bit tacky (which I don't mind) - it is not just sitting on the surface of my skin so it does not collect in my fine lines and does not just rub off when I touch my face. 

It does leave a slight shine but it's way less than all the other mineral sunscreens I have tried (except the Supergoop Matte Sunscreen which has no shine at all). I can use a generous layer of this on my face and know I am protected well from the sun without looking like a super shiny ghost."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"I have oily acne prone skin. This sunscreen does not break me out. It does have a slight white cast on darker skin however it is Comfortable to wear, so I still like using it."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"Love that this is a mineral sunscreen, and that it has a nice silicone/smoothing feel when you put it on which initially looks great under makeup. However, it breaks up your makeup over the course of the day LIKE CRAZY. Big, noticeable difference on how cakey and flaky my makeup looks when I wear this underneath it and when I don‚Äôt."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Singapore,Mdm,a bit sticky. fragrance is acceptable to me - smell like soya. ^^ i have fair skin so the white cast has minimal impact on me. 
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Malaysia,Great,This sunscreen makes me feel not sticky and the scent also great.This product didn‚Äôt make me feel sticky or dry .This product also reef safe .I love this kind of product
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Terrible pilling - not as good as other Supergood,"I love Supergoop's mattescreen, glowscreen, and unseen sunscreen so much so I thought this would be another winner. Do not be fooled -- IT IS HORRIBLE. It pills so much - with or without makeup. I had to go wash my face in the office bathroom it was pilling so badly. The whitecast is not bad on my skintone - light/medium with golden undertones but the pilling it unbearable. Wish I could return this for a different Supergood product."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,WHITE CAST,WHITE CAST for sure. I thought it wouldn't but I was wrong and I'm light skin with golden undertone and this left a white cast I had a hard time blending into my skin. I used this on my boyfriend and it left a white cast residue on him and he's light skin tone as well. Walkeda round Maui with white cast on our face. I guess better protected than not. I can't wear this with foundation. It just pills.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Barely any product in bottle.,My rating is based on the amount of product you receive. Picture taken today immediately after purchase. ‚Äú/
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"Horrible white cast, pills instantly, VERY GOOPY AND GREASY."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Not Made For Dark Skin,"This is not dark skin friendly at all, its white but when you rub it in it turned my skin into a blue/purple hue. You definitely can‚Äôt wear this alone"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,my fav face sunscreen,"Love!! This stuff works so nicely and absorbs so nicely. It has a very faint smell but I actually love it sm. I burn so easily and this does a great job protecting my skin from getting burned. Also the texture is so good, I just really like it for some reason. And doesn‚Äôt cause pimples or make me oily!!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Singapore,One of the few products I've tried that is not greasy ,Love this sunscreen - it vanishes after use and does not leave behind any residue at all. 
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"Love this- leaves no white patches which is great! Use this everyday and I love it, definitely great for under makeup and using for summer glows! It does have some smell to it but I‚Äôm not really bothered by smells anymore in makeup lol- but it is great for skin that gets sunburn easily and is amazing for any skin types. I recommend this so much. I know I‚Äôm not a professional makeup artist but I have been doing makeup since I was 2 and I have a lot of experience in it! Write back if you have any questions for me! But I def recommend and will be buying again! Also mineral sunscreen is better for skin so this one and the supergloop are perfect for anyone so make sure to get your hands on it before it blows up and sells out!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,"Works well, smells horrible","It took a little bit of rubbing in to get the white cast out and once absorbed the stickiness went away, the only reason why I wouldn't repurchase is because of the smell."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,meh,Smelled weird (like chips??) but i do appreciate no fragrance added. Don‚Äôt love it don‚Äôt hate it. Overpriced for the quality IMO. I‚Äôm pale and it leaves a very obvious white cast if I use an appropriate amount of sunscreen. I would not recommend. Face feels very tacky after it dries down.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,perfect if you wanna feel like a literal WAX DOLL!,"the consistency is so difficult to blend into ur skin and as someone with medium complexion, the white cast is impossible to avoid"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"Great sunscreen for my sensitive skin. Does not give me a rash like others do. Slight white cast, but it seems to fade over time. Like many physical sunscreens, it can be difficult to completely remove with regular face wash. I use a cream/balm and double cleanse. I would give 5 stars, but it does feel heavier than other sunscreens and somehow often ends up in my eyes."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Nope):,"I can deal with sunscreens having a white cast; however, while endlessly rubbing this product onto my face it builds up into these balls(peels off skin).
AND, as it dries your skin feels horrible almost hard!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Not for darker skin tones,"Not the worst white cast I've ever had, but definitely noticeable. Also pilled pretty bad for me, even if I didn't use other products under it."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Smells like nachos,"It does the job it claims! It spreads evenly, so when blended out properly it doesn‚Äôt leave a while cast. It‚Äôs not a chalky consistency as other mineral sunscreens turn out to be. My only concern is that it smells a bit like nachos - which is okay if applied before makeup. Every time I‚Äôve put this on my face it has smelled like literal nacho chips. I understand that fragrances irritate skin so that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt really dock a point but just be prepared to feel a little funny when applying - the smell wears off throughout the day! Overall a nice addition to my morning routine - I just wish it came in a bigger size! :) happy sun screening!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,so bad,"If you have medium/tan-dark skin tones, this will
not work. I have a medium light tan complexion and gave me such a bad white cast. It has a lightweight consistency but once you blend it in, it feels really thick on the skin. on top of that it pills horribly and smells like fritos/dog paws. so sad it didn‚Äôt work out for me."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"Not worth the money, Product smells like Fritos. It leaves a lot of white streaks, not great for darker skin tones."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"I love this sheer spf! I have really dry skin but I hate the feel of spf for dry skin as it feels like it just sits on my skin. I also have tried spf for oily skin and love that there is no feeling of it being on my skin, but they dry my skin even more. This is the perfect medium for me. I‚Äôm pretty pale and this has a barely noticeable white cast on me only for a few minutes. It‚Äôs slightly hydrating and gives my skin a really beautiful glow without the oily feel. It‚Äôs a dream to reapply too. I spend the day outside during peak sun hours sometimes and I reapply this every 2 hours and I experience no pilling and no added greasyness that some spf can get. At the end of the day my face looks glowy and radiant but feels like i have a moisturizer on. It is slightly sticky for maybe 20-30 minutes after applying but well worth it for me. I did see some reviews talking about the smell and it‚Äôs really not that bad these people must use heavily fragranced products because this smells earthy and natural to me. It doesn‚Äôt smell like sunscreen so that‚Äôs a plus. And the slight smell goes away so fast it‚Äôs not even worth mentioning"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,4 new breakouts 2 days later!,"I purchased this in hopes of switching over from the super goop play sunscreen because that one was making my makeup separate. After one use of this product, my skin has broken out. I have sensitive dry skin and this product is the worst. It smells horrible and leaves a horrible white cast (I‚Äôm fair toned). I thought the comments saying the white cast is bad were being dramatic, but I was wrong. Please save your money and try another sunscreen"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Singapore,Good for pregnant women,"When i got pregnant, I had to switch to mineral sunscreen. It's hard to find one that is not sticky and doesn't leave a whitecast. This is a good one which i will probably repurchase"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,"Heavy, tacky","Bought this hoping it would be a mineral version of Unseen Sunscreen (which I love love love), but sadly this has a heavy, tacky feeling on my face that doesn't seem to go away for hours. Put a mask on top of it at work and it feels like the sunscreen is sliding off my face. Leaves a white cast on my fair-light skin but that fades quickly. Only pluses: no scent; doesn't make my skin shiny. Back to Unseen for me!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Love this. I use a beauty blender to apply it and it feels like a primer and Illuminator.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Smells like dog paws,"This sunscreen pills up under makeup if you don‚Äôt apply directly afterward. Since buying two weeks ago, I have noticed several blemishes on my face. Plus, it smells like dog paws y‚Äôall."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"This was my first supergoop product and I really did not enjoy this sunscreen. For one this is a mineral sunscreen so it leaves a white cast which was expected, but this sunscreens smells so strong it was hard to want to keep it on my face. I have acne prone skin and this sunscreen made me breakout. I tried to like it and work with it but I just looked like a white ghost with bad texture."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,This product is not sheer at all. And the smell is gross. Don‚Äôt recommend.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Mineral with almost no white cast,The only untinted mineral sunscreen that doesn‚Äôt leave a ghost white cast! It dries down somewhat shiny and slightly tacky but nothing powder can‚Äôt fix.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"I only buy Supergoop sunscreen but this is not my fav product‚Ä¶it feels like it doesn‚Äôt fully absorb into my skin and doesn‚Äôt feel smooth, almost chalky? It literally smells like burnt hair and it sticks onto anything that touches your face (clothes, hands, etc.). I‚Äôd recommend skipping this product and going with any of the other Supergoop screens."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Flaky and doesn‚Äôt blend well with skincare/makeup,"Wanted to love but unfortunately a big no. There are better mineral sunscreens out there for half the price. Goes on smoothly at first, but after drying down, it becomes a flaky piling mess. Doesn‚Äôt blend well with any of my skin care or make up. Just makes my skin look flaky and I want to rub it all off. Disappointing product."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,there‚Äôs better,"I found one very large issue: it pulls very badly for me. It pilled with my skincare, makeup, and just friction. It make me want to just rub it all off. Has an interesting smell, almost an off putting yeast-bread smell which accumulated in my mask."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Singapore,Hate the smell!,"This sunscreen has a weird smell and made my skin breakout a little. (I have dry/sensitive skin). Read alot of good reviews but to me it was a miss. 3 stars cos it doesn't leave a white cast, doesn't feel oily/greasy."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,love,I love this sunscreen! It‚Äôs so easy to blend in and does not smell strong of fragrance. You can feel good that it‚Äôs a physical sunscreen as well.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Perfect sunscreen,My holy grail. Absolutely love this sunscreen. Goes on sheer and is the perfect last step to my AM routine. I have oily skin and this one gives me a little shine without being too much.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Singapore,Expensive but great product without white cast,"Great mineral sunscreen, definitely recommend this. It leaves zero white cast (tanned Asian here!), neutral smell, and isn't too or greasy for my combination skin. Also works under make up. Only downside is that it isn't waterproof so can't really use if at the pool or during outdoor workouts. And it's expensive for such a small tube!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,My new holy grail ‚ù§Ô∏è,This is perfect.. I love this so much! This is the best mineral sunscreen in the market. No BS ingredient. No BS fragrance which can make you have contact dermatitis. This is not drying or oily. Sits wonderful under my make up. Awesome. 5 Star! High recommend!
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Singapore,Not for combination skin,Not a sunscreen for combination skin. Left a heavy white caste and my skin was so oily full day. Never would repurchase.again.The matt one and unseen is good from supergoof.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Malaysia,fav brand,My fav brand for sunscreen. It never fails me. Love it. The texture is great. Not too thick not too runny. Just nice. The packaging is great too. Easy to apply on the skin. 
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"I‚Äôm not sure how this has so much hype. I will say it‚Äôs super light and fluffy, almost like whipped cream, and it does rub in as sheer as a mineral sunscreen can get. That‚Äôs where the pros end. It never completely absorbed, my face looked greasy and oily and felt so heavy. I gave it a couple hours and still my hair was sticking to my face and I was sweating in 40 degree weather. I had to wash it off and apply my go to Dr jart mineral sunscreen."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,So genuinely sheer! It works and doesn't leave a white cast. It also makes my skin feel soft.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Malaysia,Does not irritate skin,It does not irritate my sensitive skin after using it. 
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,"If you can get past the smell, great sunscreen!","Like other reviewers have noted, the smell is hard to get past. It definitely smells like I‚Äôm rubbing Fritos on my face. Thankfully the smell doesn‚Äôt last long. Supergoop has the best sunscreen, I typically used their unseen sunscreen but was advised to switch to a mineral sunscreen. Aside from the smell, works well and doesn‚Äôt hinder makeup application."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,that smell is hard to get over,"Smells really bad (I gagged) and noticeable white cast. I'm on the light skin side of things, but that white cast. Oof. Luckily I wore makeup over it. Makeup did wear well on this sunscreen. Would not buy again or recommend. I'll already just be forcing myself to finish it"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Bring back the old formula,"I miss the old formula!  Supergoop used to make a mineral sunscreen that was neither oily nor chalky.  This sunscreen is extremely oily, and never feels like it really dries on the face.  I have to use a lot of powder, which I normally don't, with this sunscreen - and even then, the oil comes through.  The good: it doesn't irritate my skin.  If you like to look really dewy, this sunscreen might be a good choice. I just don't understand why they got rid of the old formula."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,A savory smell,"I like the texture but the smell is savory!! It smells like I'm rubbing a Frito scented cream on my face and it leaves a slight white cast that I think fades away over time once it's warmed up no your face.
But I do like the ingredients and benefits of the product so I will use it up but probably will not repurchase because of the smell."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Malaysia,Mrs. ,"Great sunscreen. Before I was using the matte screen which is also a mineral sunscreen. I have always preferred a mineral sunscreen vs chemical. This does not leave a white cast, very lightweight and smooth to apply. Works well under makeup too. Will repurchase. "
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,the smell!!!!,Absolutely horrendous smell. I can‚Äôt stand it. And it stays faintly during the day. Plus it‚Äôs not great under any kind of makeup.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Singapore,Smooth but Heavy,"For a mineral sunscreen, it‚Äôs one of the best textures I have tried but it is still too heavy for my skin in the summer weather. However, I have a deep Indian skin tone and after letting the product set in for 5 minutes, there is no white cast."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Great Sunscreen,Love this sunscreen.  It is natural without avobenzone and it sheer and does not make your skin oily.  Protects very well and blends well with liquid foundation.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"I like this sunscreen overall, gives good protection, feels light on skin and it‚Äôs not greasy. It does leave a bit of white cast though"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Every cloud has a silver lining,"Honestly had my doubts about this product. I actually bought it by mistake‚Ä¶ I have a medium shade skin tone and it definitely has a white cast when I first put it on. HOWEVER, it does not look white once it dries and by the time I get to work in the morning it has already dried. It works AMAZINGLY as a makeup primer. I live in quite a hot place and it doesn‚Äôt get oily or melty throughout the day even with reapplication (makeup or no makeup). I honestly love it and will likely repurchase (on purpose this time!)"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,clogged my pores and made me itchy and dry,"Had high hopes for this but I don‚Äôt love it. The texture is light, almost whipped which is nice. But after applying it I‚Äôd get a tingling itchy sensation all over my face. It would last for a few minutes and go away eventually, but this is clearly a sign my face doesn‚Äôt agree with something in this. I used it for around 3 weeks and noticed it definitively clogged my pores. This was the only new product in my routine so I know this was the cause. There is a very slight white cast which was disappointing bc this was supposed to be sheer. I also felt this dehydrated my face over time. I‚Äôll just have to use the rest on my body. Will not repurchase."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Malaysia,strong white cast,"leaves an obvious white cast on me (medium deep skin tone). formula feels really nice though, it‚Äôs pretty dewy and it‚Äôs gentle enough on my skin (doesn‚Äôt make my acne worse). "
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,This is my third tube. I was very happy with the product until my latest one. This new tube has a weird smell to it and is very difficult to use. I dont know whether its a faulty product or what.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Malaysia,sunscreen,Product glides on easy on my skin and doesnt feel sticky at all. Use this for almost 12 hours yet my face doesnt feel oily as i am more towards oily skin type. Would definitely repurchase again! 
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,No irritation,This is a great mineral sunscreen. Didn‚Äôt cause any breakouts or irritation. The finish is sheer with a slight glow.. nothing greasy. I have combo oily skin and this didn‚Äôt make me anymore oily than I already am. Make sure to rub this in between your fingers before you apply (sheers out the product for a seamless finish without having a white cast). This is definitely 1 out of 2 of my favorite sunscreens (other favorite is Clinique spf 50). Give this a try if you‚Äôve had a hard time finding a sunscreen that won‚Äôt irritate the skin.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Terrible Smell,I received a free sample from a purchase I made and I have to say this sunscreen has a terrible smell. It smells like stale feet. It‚Äôs so confusing. I don‚Äôt understand why a product you put on your skin with smell this bad. I can‚Äôt get passed the smell. Giving it away.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,good enough,"Yes, it oddly smells like buttered popcorn jellybeans, but the scent fades quickly. It‚Äôs a little dry feeling on my dry skin, but performs well with my foundation and concealer. The white cast also fades quickly on me. I prefer a dewier sunscreen as mineral can be too drying, so while I‚Äôll finish this bottle, I‚Äôm not sure I will repurchase."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,nope.,"I got a sample of this sunscreen and hated it!! It has a certain smell that makes me dread putting it on & a WHITE CAST, as well as feeling tacky and sticky. Not worth the $$$!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Light Sheer Mineral Sunscreen!,"This was a really nice sunscreen that is 100% mineral which I prefer over chemical sunscreens, and is very light and sheer. You can see how it spread over my face and looks like I have nothing on! I think it‚Äôs great for people who aren‚Äôt oily and who don‚Äôt need matte but I prefer a matte finish so I gave it four stars for oily people like me that prefer matte. This is my first product from this brand and I will definitely buy their mineral matte sunscreen!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"This was not what I expected coming from Supergoop! It was white - took awhile to make sure no white showed (and I have pale skin to begin with) and left my face feeling sticky. I have tried Matte Screen, Unseen, and Glow Screen all feel and look so much better on my skin."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,I like it!,This sunscreen goes on smooth and gives a sheer appearance on the skin. It glides on this skin very easily so you don‚Äôt have to tug on your skin to rub it on your face. My makeup still blends really nice over top it. Definitely recommend.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Love the texture and finish of this product! It's perfect for my fair and acne prone skin. I don't always want something with a tint and this doesn't leave a white cast on me! I will definitely be buying another bottle
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"another great product from supergoop!! i have combination skin and this didn't irritate me at all. it's lightweight and blends easily. like the name suggests, it's sheer and doesn't leave a white cast."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Super goop sunscreen is very lightweight! I am of a darker skin tone and this product does not leave any white cast! You are paying for what you are offered and it is something I will be purchasing again.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Good sunscreen,"It was gifted by Supergoop! 
The texture feels like mousses, and it applies fairly and blend well.  It can absorb easily without leaving white cast.  It‚Äôs lightweight and hydrating.  I have used it under makeup, it may not work well.  But still a great sunscreen on its own.  dry and sensitive skin would definitely like it."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Love it!,This sunscreen is not glossy/oily and does not leave an uncomfortable residue on the skin! It's super hydrating which is awesome for my dry skin! 10/10 recommend
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,not good for my dry skin,"I got this mineral sunscreen because I've had bad luck with chemical ones, they always break me out or make me too matte but unfortunately I feel like this one isn't much of an improvement. For me it does sheer out after a bit and the white cast does go away after a few mins of applying but it feels so dry even on top of my very hydrating skincare.. it kinda feels like it sucked out all the moisture I put underneath. However, it's not a total loss, it's not causing any breakouts so I will still use on my neck, chest & other places on my body as not to be wasteful but definitely not working great on my face. For the price I'm disappointed, I expected much better results, will not repurchase."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"After about a week of daily use this sunscreen has become a favorite. I have rosacea sensitive skin and this hasn't upset my skin at all. There is a very slight white cast, but it is easily covered with a light to medium coverage foundation. It doesn't make my face feel greasy or dry it out. If you have rosy sensitive skin and are looking for a mineral sunscreen I'd recommend giving it a try! Hoping this will be offered in a larger value size like the Unseen is offered."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,MUST TRY!,"I truly love this product. I am obsessive with skincare and SPF. I am the person that asks everyone if they have worn their SPF today. I have super sensitive skin that is acne prone. This felt great on my skin. It was not sticky, did not leave a white cast, and the added squalane and aloe vera juice actually makes it moisturizing. If you are sensitive to smell that might bother you, but it quickly goes away (the smell is more on your hands than your face and I just wash my hands after). For a 100% mineral sunscreen, it is a great price with great ingredients. Also I love the bottle, you can just stick it in your purse and I don't feel like it is going to explode everywhere."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,"This has a great texture, slightly glossy but not noticeable. It doesn‚Äôt have a smell that I can discern. Rubs in quickly and smoothly‚ÄîI‚Äôm impressed!"
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Definitely not sheer,"I pretty much exclusively use chemical sunscreens because I refuse to wear anything with a white cast, but I was excited that this mineral sunscreen claimed to be sheer. Unfortunately, when I apply the recommended amount of sunscreen to my face and neck (about 1/2 tsp) it takes forever to rub in and still leaves me with a white cast. In addition to the white cast, this sunscreen is heavy and pills a lot, especially around my eyebrows and hairline."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Lightweight and Cruelty Free!,I received this Mineral Sheer Sunscreen complimentary of Supergoop! I love how lightweight this feels on my skin and doesn't leave a white cast like some other sunscreens. It is also cruelty free and doesn't break out or irritate my sensitive skin. Love Supergoop!
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Review from a sunscreen junkie,"Having had skin issues related to past sun damage I have become quite the sunscreen junkie the past ten years or so. Mostly because I hate it and I hate wearing it, but I wear it everyday. I‚Äôm always searching for the elusive HG. This isn‚Äôt quite it, but Its pretty close and I think it‚Äôs the most innovative mineral formula to come out in several years. I am oily and I have sensitive skin. This isn‚Äôt perfectly sheer, but it‚Äôs slightly more sheer than your typical mineral type sheer sunscreen that also cheats by putting octinoxate in the formula-an ingredient that is hard for me to tolerate and is being blamed for damage to coral reefs. That this formula relies on 17.5% zinc oxide and is so unbelievably light is really remarkable. I am able to put my skincare on, follow with a layer of this, then I dab a mattifying primer on my t-zone and follow with my favorite sheer foundation and my skin just looks great. I would believe that you could layer this over a moisturizer without issues if you are drier because I did layer this over two somewhat thick serums without issue. I have to blot and powder, but not as much as with other products. My pores are not amplified at the end of the day as they normally are. It‚Äôs a pretty neutral consistency. I can‚Äôt wait to see what the brand comes out with-they really push the envelope in what I think is an important category. I read a review or two that stated this seemed like nothing special or like other sunscreens they had tried but I would like to know which because I have literally tried every option HE or drugstore, Korean, Japanese, Euro, US formulated-this is different considering the ingredients."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,"Definitely ‚ÄúSheer‚Äù, not ‚ÄúClear‚Äù","*I received this product complimentary from Supergoop! to sample. 

This mineral Sheer Screen is exactly what it says it is. It is sheer, not completely clear. I have a lighter, Asian complexion that has a natural yellow tint to it. I was a little skeptical at first because the initial spreading of the product appears white. After rubbing it in properly though, it only left a slightly white residue, not overwhelming. The picture attached is an *immediate* before after. After about 30 minutes, the whiteness of the sunscreen calmed down even more and I spent the day without makeup feeling fine. Not too greasy, and it felt good on my sensitive skin. 

I also tried it with makeup immediately after applying, and it did not mess up my foundation color which makes this a good choice for me to wear under my makeup for work. 

Overall, I think this is a great foundation for days at the office, brunch, or casual outings. I will continue to use their other products for more heavy outdoor usage on runs, hikes, bike rides, etc."
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,Doesn‚Äôt feel too different from any other off the shelf sunscreen someone would purchase. Goes on fairly sheer. Does have a white cast to it even after blending for a few minutes. Also had a greasy residue feel. Unfortunately would not recommend because I do enjoy supergoop as a brand
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,So good!,This stuff is amazing. I layer it under my makeup so I am protected from the sun. It blends in nicely to my skin. It has a sheer look to it. I love super goop. Their products are amazing. I love that the spf is 30 too.
SUPERGOOP!-Mineral Sheer Screen SPF 30,USA,Was very sticky and had a weird smell (bad batch?),"I did not like this sunscreen at all! I have extremely oily skin and hoped this would be a good sunscreen to use on my face. Instead, it left my skin feeling sticky and tacky. Plus, there was a really weird smell when I applied it. I tried it a few different times with different moisturizers. But nothing helped. I applied it to my bare arms and still had the same sticky feeling for 6+ hours. Maybe I just had a bad batch. But I am disappointed that this didn‚Äôt work."
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Pure Moisture Sun Lotion,Singapore,DD Sun lotion,"Given 4 stars because this sun screen shows white cast if using a ""matte"" product before applying this. If use oil base or glowy base will not have this problem. So far so gd."
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Pure Moisture Sun Lotion,Singapore,Great product,"It does not leave a white cast(?) is that how people say it? Not sticky or oily, does not make me feel like I‚Äôm 2 tones fairer, and definitely can be used under your makeup because it‚Äôs so light you might forget you wore sunscreen"
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Pure Moisture Sun Lotion,Malaysia,Great!!,"Finding a suitable sunscreen is not easy. I‚Äôve been using many different brands from normal to high end. And, this Dear Dahlia perfectly works well on my skin. I have dry combination skin type and very sensitive. So, best point is this doesn‚Äôt make me break out. It tones up, a bit glow and not greasy. For oily skin, you can skip moisturizer. Hope, the full size will restock soon! "
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Pure Moisture Sun Lotion,Singapore,Good,"I have oily skin and first impression was bad, it was too shiny, glowy and oily, my skin felt suffocated - I had used it over my usual moisturizer. Then I tried it on its own and although it‚Äôs still too oily for my skin type, the shine is more tolerable. It has a tone up effect and makes skin look smoother the whole day, definitely can replace my foundation if there aren‚Äôt acne to be concealed. It smells like lavender too. "
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Pure Moisture Sun Lotion,Singapore,"Works well, good consistency","I like that this was not too heavy and has hydrating effects, though my face looks slightly white-cast and oilier after a few hours. I use it when I want to skip my BB cream."
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Pure Moisture Sun Lotion,Singapore,not oily at all,I had use their bb base and super love it so I bought this as well. a bit oily but perfect during the colder and rainy weather. definitely need to reapply unless touch up with SPF powder
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Pure Moisture Sun Lotion,Malaysia,Sangat menyukainya!,Digunakan sebelum menggunakan foundation atau BB cream. Sun screen pertama yang saya cuba dan saya berpuas hati. Ia mempunyai struktur yang agak ringan.
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Pure Moisture Sun Lotion,Malaysia,Ms,"I think this work ok, but the smell was quite intense. Therefore, i rarely wore this due to the smell. But whenever i wore it, it did not break me out"
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Pure Moisture Sun Lotion,Singapore,BEST SUNSCREEN EVER ,"This is the best ever , firstly because it‚Äôs 100% mineral , high protection AND moisturising / soothing . Does leave a little bit of a white cast but it looks more like a tone up so good under makeup as well. Most mineral sunscreens are drying but not this one . I have very oily but dehydrated skin btw with flakey spots and this does not aggravate my skin at all. "
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Pure Moisture Sun Lotion,,Moisture Sun Lotion,"Dry skin will enjoy using this product. Glides on relatively smooth but seriously leaves a teeny bit of white cast which I don't mind. Oily skin will find this a little too heavy. Works very well under make up.  Sometimes, I skip my moisturiser and this will work well alone. "
DEAR DAHLIA-Skin Paradise Pure Moisture Sun Lotion,,"High coverage, smooth texture, MUST GET ","Smooth and comfortable texture with super high coverage SPF50 and PA++++. The highest SPF in market is SPF75 and normally has a drying/ stinging texture. This is pricey but very comfortable. When it comes to the face, it's worth it !"
LA MER-The SPF 50 UV Protecting Fluid,Malaysia,Worth a Try,"I am very finicky when it comes to sunscreen because most sunscreens either sting/burn my eyes or give me countless comedones in a matter of days. This is not specifically designed for sensitive skin but it doesn‚Äôt irritate my eyes and skin. It is watery but absorbed quite readily into the skin when rubbed in and doesn‚Äôt give that oily shiny finish, actually it more like a glow"
LA MER-The SPF 50 UV Protecting Fluid,Malaysia,Favourite!,This is my fourth time buying this products! I love how it is appear on my skin and the texture is really really nice compared to other Sunscreen products. 
LA MER-The SPF 50 UV Protecting Fluid,Malaysia,good,Pricey compared to Lanc√¥me or other product. But this is the only sunscreen that won‚Äôt cause me breakout . It can stay well with your foundation n long last for whole day. 
LA MER-The SPF 50 UV Protecting Fluid,Singapore,Sunscreen ,A little disappointed with this product. The fluid is too watery and it takes a long time to absorb. Not ideal to apply with makeup if you‚Äôre in a rush to go out. 
LA MER-The SPF 50 UV Protecting Fluid,Malaysia,Best And smooth ,I like this product so much. It helps my skin from UV. It protected my skin from darkness and breaking out. I feel my skin more healthy right now. I recommend for everyone to use it before go out. 
LA MER-The SPF 50 UV Protecting Fluid,Singapore,mrs,This is the perfect sunscreen for me. I‚Äôm outdoors a lot and this la mer fluid is non greasy and super light and absorbs very well into my skin. I‚Äôve been using this product for a year now and I absolutely love it. 
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Favorite SPF For Summer,"I have the SPF 30 with Marigold Extract version. I like it because the spray works well. The product itself is nice 'cause it dries down quickly and doesn't budge. I use it for when I want something waterproof when being outside during hot sunny days. It does have a white cast, but I like it since I use it for when I want the reassurance that it's on my skin. It's protected me at the beach, at a music festival, or all day at an amusement park. I can't wait to try the SPF 50 with Green Tea version because I like the idea of higher SPF."
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! 100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,The product I received is not the product that was promoted. The product I received is SPF 30 and has marigold extract. It is not SPF 50 with green tea extract. It also creates a white layer of sunscreen that per the bottle is suppose to blend easily but doesn‚Äôt. Leave a white cast and sticky feeling. Not the best formula and misleading marketing for the product.
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,wrong product,"I ordered this based off of the description, but if you scroll to the second picture, you‚Äôll see an SPF 30 with marigold extract. That is what I received, not the SPF 50 as described."
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,Singapore,good but pricey,"Read reviews about this spreadability being zero, but still decided to give it a try. Tried their vitamin c sunscreen mist before and I actually prefer this in terms of the finishing. The vitamin c mist gives a slightly oily (you can feel it‚Äôs there but minimal) but this feels very water based and gives a matte finishing. Cons - pricier and lower SPF (but SPF 30 is actually enough imo)"
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,Malaysia,sunscreen,I use this during working on construction site . Where you hardly need to apply sunscreen regularly as you are exposed to the sunlight most of times . With this i can easily spray it on without need to rub it against my fingers and it is convenient to carry around
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,Singapore,White cast ,"Close to a 4 star for the product! 
Comes out as mousse that can be rubbed in but a little bit sticky once it dries up. It leaves a white cast on my face afterwards, hard to even it out.."
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Best When You Need Waterproof Staying Power,"Spreadability non-existent, so wherever you put it, that's where it will stay. I have dry, eczema-prone skin, and this makes my skin feel extremely dry. But it is pretty darn waterproof, which is great for when I need that (hiking/swimming/sweating). Otherwise, I'll use other body sunscreens on a daily basis. I do wish the SPF was higher than 30. If it's already going to leave an opaque white cast anyway, then why not just raise the SPF? I also wish they'd make a body version of their mineral sheer screen (and maybe have higher SPF in them both)."
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! 100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,"I love this sunscreen. It isn‚Äôt thick goopy old school zinc oxide. It‚Äôs sprays on thinly and rubs in easily and the white goes away. Yes, mineral sunscreen is white (so you need to know what you are ordering but then don‚Äôt complain it‚Äôs white - it‚Äôs mineral). I really like this one. I need mineral sunscreen because I‚Äôm so fair and this is a really easy one to spray on and use. Highly recommend."
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Best mineral waterproof SPF,"This is a really great mineral sunscreen! If you know anything about zinc oxide only sunscreen than you, know it‚Äôs going to have a white cast. It‚Äôs a characteristic of zinc oxide. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin. All chemical sunscreens make me break out. I have tried 15 different physical sunscreens in the last two years. This is one of my favorites! Not only is it waterproof, it is also lightweight and if you spray it in small areas at a time it spreads easily. Yes, you will still have a white sheen. To me, that is preferable than getting a sunburn or having hives & white pimple like bumps from chemical sunscreens. I wish I would have tried this one sooner in my search for a waterproof mineral sunscreen. It is one of the best formulations and unique formulations, I don‚Äôt know if any other mineral sprays. This makes application a breeze!"
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! 100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,"This went on completely white and did not blend by hand or by just drying. I waited 30 minutes before doing anything, and it still smeared on to everything I touched or brushed up against - my purse, the leather interior in my car, everything. And it did not clean off those things easily. Supergoop is a go-to brand for me, but this is going in the trash."
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Doesn‚Äôt blend and got burnt,This sunscreen is truly terrible. I love the supergoop mattescreen and thought that this would be similar - very wrong. This goes on AND dries extremely white - doesn‚Äôt ever blend in and is extremely drying and chalky feeling. I also got extremely burnt - not sure if it‚Äôs because it was so hard to blend or if it wore off but it did not protect me at all.
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,"Hard to blend, but you definitely won‚Äôt get burnt!","I wanted to love this so much, but it does leave a white layer on top of your skin and is hard to rub in! It will also leave a residue on your swimsuit, although that‚Äôs easy to rub off with a towel... That being said, it does last ALL DAY even through swimming, tanning and boating! I put it on once, never had to reapply and didn‚Äôt get any color after an entire day on the lake (and I am very fair). Final thoughts: not worth it! There are better sunscreens out there."
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Yikes!,"I was hoping to like this.  Based on a good number of reviews didn't expect the white-cast residue.  Also, I noticed it took quite a bit of time to disappear and not completely.  Oh well, I tried and at this price point, will be returning."
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Not a fan,"Leaves white residue, gets all over everything. Doesn‚Äôt apply smoothly and creates blotchy application. Shook as directions stated to."
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,,must buy,"I use it for my entire body, easy to spray and the nozzle has a ‚Äúlock‚Äù function which is useful especially when travelling don‚Äôt have to worry about it‚Äôs contents spilling."
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,,Just Lovely,"I was having thoughts before purchasing this product. Turns out it is not a bad choice. Yes, it is white liquid which could get all over your face when sprayed but I just sprayed it on my palm hence I could control the amount. It doesn't dry or make my face oily. Doesn't leave white cast on my face either. "
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,,Opinion,"The product is good for your skin, gentle and effective. But but but, the cap is so so so hard to use... every time I am like a joker after makeup because of the left over product on cap.."

SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,not great,"this sunscreen left a white cast and did not rub in, i should hve returned but never did. bummed because i've used other super goop products before that i've liked"
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! 100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,"No matter how long I shake it, I still get a very noticeable white cast and it is extremely difficult to rub in. I gave it two stars because it does provide sun protection and also has a nice misting spray. However, I definitely will not be purchasing again."
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,,like the product not the dispenser ,I was looking for the spray on mineral sunscreen so decide to try it. Does leave a tacky feeling but since I use it mainly for swimming it does not bother me. But careful not so get it in your hair since it‚Äôs quite tacky. The product is easy to spread around your body and does not have the typical sunscreen smell which I don‚Äôt like. I really hope the dispenser was made better. The dispenser is quite difficult to press down sometimes I have to use 2 hands to do it. 
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,if you wanna be a snowman...,"This sunscreen is unbelievable. We were all so embarrassed to look like we were spray painted with the paint you use on the road to make lanes. It doesn‚Äôt rub in at all, and after days of showering, it‚Äôs still stuck in the creases of your skin. DO NOT BUY!"
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,"white cast, drying","This leave a white cast even if you rub it in aggresively. Also it is very drying, I have oily skin and this managed to dry my skin. very disappointed"
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,,yasss,This is the first sunscreen that protect my skin from sunburn.My skin is very sensitive to sunlight and tend to have freckles (inherit it from my momüò´) upon sun exposure.I‚Äôve tried various of sunscreen from drugstore to high-end but this one is the best off all.It has white because it‚Äôs physical sunscreen.I only can apply it under makeup and spread it evenly on my skin or else I might have blotchy white skin.
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,,Feedback,Really nice product ! Good quality! Really love the finish! Its really works at my 1st trial and its make me smile.. i will keep continue this poduct !
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Wonderful!,"This is a wonderful mineral sunscreen! I feel protected and that it moisturized my skin very well. Mineral sunscreen is best for sensitive skin and I typically break out in rashes with anything that triggers my skin. But this didn‚Äôt do that. 

It is suppose to spray white as it states on the bottle to continue to shake if it sprays clear. So it does or can leave a white cast, which is expected for a mineral sunscreen. No matter how hard I tried to blend it, it made me look ashy. It could also be my olive skin tone too. If you can deal with the cast it may leave behind, I‚Äôd recommend trying it. 

I went through mine within a month and a half‚Äôs time because I live in the desert and reapply every two hours so it goes fast for me. But otherwise, it‚Äôs a great mineral sunscreen!"
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Disappointing,"Super disappointed in this sunscreen. Left a horrible white cast all over and didn't rub in at all. After an hour in the sun, you could still see that I had it on. It was effective over the several hours I was in the sun, but I am still really bummed that it wasn't better, especially given the price. I will say that it didn't upset my sensitive skin, but I won't use it other than around my house."
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,My new HG body sunscreen! :),"I purchased a bottle of this sunscreen while my fianc√© and I were visiting.family and friends in Chicago. This sunscreen is easy to apply and rubs in nicely leaving skin feeling moisturized without any white cast and you cannot even feel or smell or on your skin once it has been absorbed. I wish that this mineral sunscreen had an even higher SPF but you can't have your cake and eat it too. My fianc√© and I both have sensitive, combination skin and we have not had any issues using this sunscreen on our bodies for the last couple weeks. My fianc√© uses this on his body and the Josie Maran sunscreen on his face. I use this on my body and I alternate between Tatcha and Tom Ford sunscreen on my face. I highly recommend this sunscreen if you are looking for a mineral sunscreen for your body that is aerosol, alcohol, fragrance, and white cast free... I highly recommend this sunscreen. You'll forget that you had even applied it! :)"
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,I love this sunscreen!,"This is the best all mineral sunscreen for the body that I‚Äôve used so far.  It comes out as a mousse that rubbed in easily and left no feeling of any sort behind. I‚Äôm very fair, and I did notice a slight white cast as I was applying it that went away very quickly (but I can‚Äôt say for sure it would go away as completely on someone with darker skin).  I don‚Äôt dread putting this on and I don‚Äôt rush to wash it off because I don‚Äôt feel it and I forget it‚Äôs even there."
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,"Beware - inner tube moves, rendering spray useless","Pretty whitening and hard to spread, as you would expect from a mineral sunscreen. I accepted that because i love the idea of a spray bottle. Except my second time using it the inner tube must have dislodged because it would no longer spray!! I tried to open it and because it's an airless can, it wouldn't open. Sigh spent $$ on this for nothing"
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,INCREDIBLE!!,I was a bit nervous to try this product out due to some bad reviews saying this leaves a horrible white cast. They are all so wrong! I‚Äôve tried dozens of mineral sunscreens and this is by far the BEST one I‚Äôve used! It goes on mostly clear with a tiny trace of white but easily blends in and disappears better than any other mineral sunscreen. I‚Äôm very picky with the way sunscreens feel on my skin and love how moisturizing and lightweight it is. My only complaint   is the price-point. I wish it was a bit cheaper considering you use quite a bit of it.  It‚Äôs totally worth the $$. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! 100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,Great mineral spray sunscreen! Yes it‚Äôs white when you spray it and leaves a little white cast if you don‚Äôt blend well but that‚Äôs what you expect with a mineral sunscreen. Spray nozzle is very smooth and doesn‚Äôt clog. I spray this on my legs after the supergoop oil sunscreen to help it blend.
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,,not for medium to dark skintones,"Pros: 
>Not greasy (unless I didn‚Äôt an adequate amount of water that day)
>Perfect for light skin tone
>good for those with non-oily skin

Cons:
>The nozzle got stuck within a month, resulting in a terrible spray 
>Leaves a white cast on my medium skin tone
>A bit tacky 

Overall, i would not recommend this to anyone who has dark skin tone, and those who have really oily skin. At times, it does feel weird on my skin.

SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Great formula and application!,Absolutely love this product. Love it so much I did multiple Instagram stories about it while on vacation! I'd never used a spray sunscreen before so part of it was the novelty factor but it's also a really good formula. I didn't get burned at all and was in 100 degree heat and in and out of the pool all day. It's easy to use: sprays evenly and isn't chalky. Not much of a smell and non-irritating all around. Held up well in the water and didn't need reapplying as often as other sunscreens. Love that it's mineral based.  Highly recommend and will repurchase!
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,,Not sticky but not for darker skin tones,It's perfect as a sunscreen for your body but leaves a slight white cast when used on the face. I wouldn't really recommend this for those with darker skin tones. I wear a Light or Neutral shade for foundations but this still looks slightly white on my face. The finish is pretty matte though and does not leave a shiny gloss on your face like many sunscreens so that's a plus for me. 
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! 100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,"I am not sure if this actually works as a sunscreen since I got tan. But, I can said for certain that it leaves a white cast. It does not matter how much I shake it, the is no clear mist coming out of it. On top of that, once I go out to the sun, I can feel my skin dry out. I will not recommend this sunscreen at all."
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,,ms,"Didn‚Äôt expect to love this... bought 2 for my teenagers children than tried it on my own. It is so easy to use and I had replaced this with my conventional SPF. Also, it‚Äôs so refreshing - a cooling spray to perk you up and SPF touchup at the same. Is really a Why not product - must buy"
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Perfect sunscreen for the summer,"Amazing product, easy to apply, absorbs quickly, not sticky, works great in the sun, and I had no allergic reaction. 

This is a mineral sunscreen aka not full of chemical sunscreens. Zinc can leave a bit of a white cast, but it's safer for your skin than chemical sunscreens. This is why Zinc"
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! 100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,"Great mineral protection, but does leave a white cast on skin."
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,Supergoop! 100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,I had such high hopes but definitely left a white cast on my skin. Returning this product for sure.
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,USA,white cast,it works but leaves a really strong white cast so I will be returning.  would definitely not use it on my face.
SUPERGOOP!-100% Mineral Sunscreen Mist SPF 30,,worthy sunscreen!,A very good sunscreen. Its is 100 mineral which why i like. It doesn‚Äôt make my face oily at all. It gives a matte look. Minus the 1.5 star because it makes my face looks pale. Will repurchase it later!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,I got a sample size of this sunscreen on one of the summer sunscreens sets. The product is very difficult to spread and it's not light at all. The moisturizer from this collection worked well for me but this is no good.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,love/hate but mostly love it,"I have a love hate relationship with this. The price is hurtful for what it is but I love the texture and how it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and somewhat protected from the sun. This alone out in direct sun it does basically nothing, but it layers well with actual SPF (I use the glow recipe SPF). I love that it does offer some sun protection for my day to day life (windows, running out etc). It does sting the eyes once you get your skin wet in that area, but it doesn‚Äôt bother my eyes otherwise.  Overall I like the layer ability, and will probably continue to use it into the fall and winter"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Perfect morning moisturizer & sun protection.,Can‚Äôt recommend this highly enough! Very moisturizing & never irritates my skin. Got a sample & had to buy the full size when I used that up.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Not for oily skin,"I am on my 3rd bottle & last bottle. I‚Äôve used this during all 4 seasons.  I have oily skin&  this only makes it worse. ÔøºÔøº My face is so shiny after putting it on.  On video calls, my skin looks so greasy.  I‚Äôm constantly blotting to remove the shine.  At the end of the day, my skin feels icky and I can‚Äôt wait to wash it off. This may work for those with dry skin."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,I got the sample size with one of my orders and I love it so much I ordered the full size. It is perfect if you don't want to use a separate moisturizer and sunscreen. I love it so much.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,"Got a sample size, product is slightly moisturizing and does not leave a white cast, but takes forever to soak in and feels greasy all day. No scent. Would not purchase a full size."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,awesome product,Very lightweight‚Äî no white cast & absorbs quickly!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Great product.,Great product. I lived it and recommend to everyone. This Sunday applied it only once and feel very well protected.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Meh,The SPF isn‚Äôt as effective as other brands like Kiehl‚Äôs. My cheeks were a bit pink after a few hours of running errands. I wish I would‚Äôve read the other reviews about it stinging your eyes because they‚Äôre spot on - I had to wash my eyes to make the tears stop.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Highly recommended by repeat buyer.,"I'm on my second bottle of this. I have very dry skin. The creamy lotion absorbs quickly and very effectively. My skin does not itch later in the day, which is a problem I have experienced with other facial moisturizers. The high SPF is a plus."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,Love the sunscreen itself but the bottle is not well designed at all. I‚Äôve had it for a week and I assume that the change in pressure due to heat and flying cracked the bottle. Really disappointed because the product is great! Hopefully there‚Äôs a redesign coming
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Great stuff,"So far, so good!  I have only been using this for 3 days.  I must say I love it.  I was using the tinted moisturizer by Laura Mercier, as they discontinued my Chanel or it is out of stock.  I have relatively good skin for 70 years old.  I really do not need foundation, just this and some bronzer.  I do not spend a lot of time in the sun, so this should be perfect.  I will update in a couple of weeks."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,By far my favorite sunblock! I love that this is hydrating and leaves my face not so much oily but just that hydrated glow! Most sunblocks are oily but not this one.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Great moisturizer/sunscreen.,"Great moisturizer/sunscreen for daily use. I use it everyday, unless I‚Äôm on the boat or will be in a lot of sun. It‚Äôs light but moisturizing. I‚Äôve read that even sitting in front of a computer or near windows exposes your face to ultraviolet rays. This feels like nothing on, so it‚Äôs great for those of us who don‚Äôt like a lot of goop on their skin.  For the record, I‚Äôm 70 and fanatic about what‚Äôs on my face."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Lightweight and hydrating,"Very nice sunscreen. I have dry-combo  skin and I find this formula hydrating. It also feels very lightweight and dries down to nothing on the skin. It also doesn't mess with makeup. Out of all the face sunscreen I tried (which is quite a lot), I rank this within the top 5. Highly recommended to the drier skin types!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Not exactly for oily/combination skin,"This was recommended to me however, it‚Äôs greasy and has a odd smell. So please listen to the reviews if you have oily skin or combination skin. Pros? It gives you a nice glow I guess!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Love,"The best! My skin is on the dry side, I love the texture of this.  Not too heavy but really moisturizing.  I‚Äôm on my 3rd tube, I wear it everyday."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,"I've been using this for about 2 or so years and love it. I have combo skin, kinda leaning on the oilier side, so I try to steer clear of products that are going to feel too heavy. This is the best lightweight formula I've found so far! Highly recommend. I haven't actually tried anything else from this brand so I need to explore it more."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,I have very sensitive and dry skin. Have used multiple products before but nothing worked great except this product. I am happy with the product after using it. It made my skin clear and glossy. Would highly recommend for dry and sensitive skin.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Just no,"I read the reviews about this hurting the eyes, and thought it won‚Äôt happen to me because my eyes aren‚Äôt sensitive. Wrong! I was at a baseball game and I was miserable with stinging eyes. Then I had to drive 2 hours..I ran inside and washed my face as soon as I got home and I will never use this again!!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Bad reaction,For other people this product might work very well but for me this thing messed my eyes lids up badly !! Worse thing to happen to me ever!! Betty disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Dry skin gone,"I love this stuff,my skin at 45 was dry and because of this it's dry free..idkn how long it will keep working but for now it's my fav product"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,"Light texture, great under makeup or even on its own. Been using this for years and is a staple for some extra SPF protection"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,Singapore,watery,"This is a very strange sunscreen, usually my face will be oily after the whole say but with this sunscreen it becomes watery? Like there are water droplets on my face? And also then it stings my eye"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,My favorite moisturizer is so nice on my skin looks very moisturize and glows. Plus I have seen a big difference on my skin looks so much better. I get compliments all the time. Sit great with makeup.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Go To Daily Moisturizer,This is my favorite day time moisturizer. It has a great texture and leaves no greasy residue. The best thing about it is that it ACTUALLY provides hydration. I wear SPF every day and I find it cumbersome to apply two separate products. I love that this does it all.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Love it,"This great on, it makes my skin feel hydrated instead of chalky or cakey like I get from other sunscreens.  I have purchased this about 6 times since my first bottle."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,Really great for dry skin because the texture is thicker like a moisturizer but dries down to a satin finish. It does not feel heavy or greasy on the skin and seems to sit well under makeup as well.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,not for sensitive skin,not for sensitive skin! caused irritation and breakouts for me
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Hurt my eyes without putting makeup on it,"The sunscreen is quite moisturizing. This could be a day cream in summer for dry skin. The only thing is it hurts my eyes after putting on for an hour. It won't hurt you eyes immediately but it will make me cry after 1-2 hours. But if I put makeup on this sunscreen, it would be fine."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,leaves white residue,I assume it works well but it‚Äôs too watery for me and it leaves my eyebrows white (they are Micro-bladed) I need protection but not white eyebrows LOL
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,I really like this moisturizer. All the low reviews make me sad because this is a good hydrating SPF. This product gives me a nice smooth finish. I use as an overnight moisturizer.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,"Nice finish, no irritation but pills under makeup","The texture was good, no irritation and it left my skin hydrated but not at all greasy.  The one problem is that it did not play well with makeup and will pill up regardless of the makeup or application technique (tried with fingers, brush and sponge).  If not for the pilling I would definitely buy it again because I liked the finish and it felt good on my sensitive skin (my eyes are very sensitive to SPF and this one did not bother my eyes at all and I did not feel any tingling on my skin which is also a common thing with SPFs).  If I‚Äôm not wearing makeup then it works wonderfully but doesn‚Äôt work on days when I wear makeup."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,"I really wanted to like this, but unfortunately I did not. While it is lightweight and moisturizing, it did not absorb well. My skin was left greasy even after using blotting papers. I didn't notice a strong scent or really any scent as other reviewers have. I did experience watery, sensitive eyes while wearing this. I would only recommend this product if you have very dry skin and do not have sensitive eyes."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Irritates my eyes- dealbreaker,"I am loyal to Peter Thomas Roth. Love most of PTR‚Äôs products but this really irritates my eyes. It is light weight and feels good on my skin but the eye irritation is unbearable & is why I will not buy this again. To be clear, I don‚Äôt even put this once close to or around my eyes but somehow it still gets irritated."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Best lightweight SPF,amazing for combo skin!! so light and doesn‚Äôt feel sticky like typical face spfs. would definitely buy the full size for daily use because right now i have the travel size which lasts a long time as well.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,My absolute favorite product to use in the morning. It‚Äôs a 2-in-1 moisturizer/spf. Buying my third bottle.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,"Great product, lousy packaging","I really like this moisturizer. But, the dispenser fell apart after a few uses (the cap came unstuck). I got it -- sort of -- stuck back together, and am now treating it with great care. As long as it sits undisturbed on my shelf it's probably fine, but no way could I ever travel with it, and it's too thick to decant to something else. Really frustrating."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,New Staple Product,"A little bit goes a long way. Dries down butter-soft, does not leave your face greasy, sticky, or tacky feeling. No strong sunscreen smell. Layed down well over regular moisturizer as well. I will be throwing this in my luggage for all my travels this summer as well as incorporating it in my day to day."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Great texture,This is my absolute favorite sunscreen. I have over 40 combination skin and hate thick creams. This feels more like a serum. I love it so much. The price point is very high unfortunately.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Makes my eyes sting!,"This is a nice sunscreen, smells good and feels really nice on my skin, however, it really makes my eyes sting.  To the point I can't use this product."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,It‚Äôs hard to find a moisturizer with high SPF that doesn‚Äôt feel like paste. I‚Äôve tried dozens. I use this one every day with a CC Cream that also has SPF and my skin never feels like it‚Äôs under layers of product.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,"I tried a sample sized tube that was a good size for traveling. It felt nice and hydrating going on, not too heavy or sticky, but the sun protection was basically non-existent. I applied it generously a few minutes before being outside in partly cloudy winter sun for about 2 hours, and still ended up getting a little pink on my nose and cheeks, which is far inferior to my normal SPF products. It also migrated towards my eyes and was a bit irritating, but not the worst I‚Äôve ever felt. Won‚Äôt be purchasing the full size."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,"Over 40 folks, buy it!!",The best moisturizer I‚Äôve purchased. It makes your skin soft. I have combination skin and it works great.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Meh,I have used many PTR products over the years and they are pretty good. I do have to say that this sunscreen has been a disappointment. It feels nice going on but did not give me great protection and is so slippery that it is hard to keep it out of my eyes-stings like a bugger. Not a good value in my opinion.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Went back the next day for more,"Bought the sample size on a trip when the air was drying out my face and I hadn't packed moisturizer. Went back the next day for the full size plus another travel size...light, not oily and sunscreen all packed into one!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Does OK job not excellent,"Easily absorbable cream has high SPF for sun protection, works well."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Doesn't play well with other products,"I received this by mistake instead of a different moisturizer I ordered and decided to just keep it. By itself it is quite good as a moisturizer/sunscreen. Sadly it does not play well with my other skincare products and makeup. It doesn't fully sink into my skin and pills up under my foundation, and I wind up with weirdly greasy eyebrows. Also not a fan of facial SPF that smells like literal suntan lotion. Not great."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Repeat 5th purchase,"I have purchased this 5 times, it is let of my routine I do use foundation 6 days out of the week so I need to have hidrates dewy skin ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,I got this stuff as a sample and I love this!!! It‚Äôs very expensive but it works well and has the right quench for your skin!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Great sunscreen and really moisturizing,"I love this stuff, no white cast and sooo moisturizing. Works so well under my make up. Highly recommended!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Does not blend,"I liked this when I first started using it, it was lightweight and creamy. But after a few months, the texture has changed. When it comes out of the pump and I rub it into my face, it just sits there. It has become immovable and unbendable without a ton of rubbing and massaging. I don't need to workout my face every morning just to get my SPF. I will not buy this again and PTR needs to adjust the formula."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Best lightweight SPF daily moisturizer,"This has become my go-to everyday moisturizer. I had been searching for a while to find a light weight everyday moisturizer with SPF that wasn't too heavy or greasy and didn't leave a white tint. I can wear it under makeup, but I still prefer to use a non-SPF moisturizer under makeup. However, for most of my days where I do not wear foundation, this is perfect! I would not consider this for heavy activity or swimming. I am taking off one star because it is difficult to tell how much is left in the bottle. It would be nice if they offered this in a jar or made the contents visible on the outside of the bottle with a clear window."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,Very silky feeling and easy to apply. Doesn‚Äôt leave a cast on my skin.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,"Love it, wish it weren't so expensive.","Bought it when the store was out of my usual moisturizer.  Was more than I wanted to spend, but admittedly I love it.  Goes on smooth and feels great.  Will likely repurchase."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,Very moisturizing!! Not greasy leaves skin smooth and no cast .
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,Singapore,Perfect,"I've been looking for sun protection for my face for years that doesn't make me break out, does not leave a white cast or have that biting sensation and finally i found it. This moisturiser is light and hydrating while offering protection. Highly recommended"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Greasy waste of money,"This moisturizer is super greasy and separates very easily. I've had it come out of the tube half oil, half lotion. The worst separation I have had though was when I put it in a smaller travel container and within a day, the product separated so badly, it was unusable. Waste of money."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Effective workout being oily!!,"Ok, so I have 35yo oily skin. Not only is this moisturizing enough for right after the shower, but it's effective without being white and streaky and it's actually not oily!! I forget which YouTuber recommended this but it is well worth the splurge! By far and wide the facial sunscreen I've been looking for my whole life!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,"Great Product, Horrible Bottle","I‚Äôve bought this moisturizer 3 times now. It has a weird pump dispenser that‚Äôs always getting clogged, so I end up having to take off the pump and just smack the bottle against my hand. And then I have to worry that the moisturizer will oxidize if I don‚Äôt screw the pump back on right. The design makes you waste so much product. The product itself is great if you have dry, sensitive skin and want a good amount of SPF. I never feel like it‚Äôs too heavy, though I have very naturally dry skin."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,Fabulous sheer coverage and works well as a primer for any makeup you might wear. Love love love this product. The size of the bottle makes me feel better about buying it again. Definitely in my top 3 sunscreens.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,very moisturizing,"Very moisturizing! Scent is a bit off putting, smells a bit bad. Absorbs into the skin nicely, leaves a dewy finish, not overly greasy looking. Only downside I found with this is it ran into my eyes all day long and burned."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Waaaay too expensive and generic,"White cast (I'm fair to medium) and greasy appearance. Doesn't feel like water, thats for sure. Feels and works like a run of the mill sunscreen at a laughable price. It doesn't break my skin out or leave it feeling coated in the powdery feel some sunscreens can encrusted in the face as the day wears on. Light, Non offensive scent. I will say that I use two full pumps and still feel my face get a little sore if I'm in the sun. I don't reapply though. It would ruin my makeup so this rating is for those interested in only applying sunscreen once (not recommended, but the reality for most faces.)"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,"Very hydrating, liquid like spf","I really like this product. Wish I could give it a 3.5 instead of 3. I'd say its more of an SPF and less of a moisturizer. It has a thin, semi-creamy to liquid texture. It comes out as a light cream but then becomes more like a liquid once it warms up. Reminds me of Paula's Choice Resist Hydrating fluid SPF, but more moisturizing for sure. I have combination, sensitive skin and it works well with it. I don't know if it is an everyday moisturizer as it is marketed, but for being out all day in the sun that would be great! I hate feeling dried out by a spf for my face. I don't feel I need to use a moisturizer really with it like some other SPFs. I use my serums before and top it with this and its great for a light makeup day WFH. I sit by a window for WFH and need SPF every day. This gives me a shine/glow which I like, I know some people may not want that look. I do think this works best with a light makeup day. I wouldn't use this under a full glam look. I also haven't noticed any pilling like with some SPFs. For me, there is also not really a white-cast but I do have fairer skin though and that may not work for other skin tones. I think it takes a little time to soak in and it's not going to become matte. I like that I feel hydrated and have a little glow over feeling matte and dryer. So I'd look at that if you're not wanting to have a sheen on your skin. My one final point is that it does get into eyes easily it seems which can be annoying. But overall I really do like it and would buy again."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,I love this SPF.   It goes on smoothly and feels moisturizing on the skin.  Not greasy or shiny at all.  I wear SPF 365 days a year    This one feels great on and is a nice base before applying makeup.  Love it will buy it again
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,"Great product, terrible packaging","I love the product inside this bottle. It's light, it doesn't smell too strongly of suncreen, it doesn't clog my pores, and it's not greasy. So great! However...

I hate the bottle itself. It's poorly designed and using it is intensely frustrating. It's not obvious whether you should try to shake the product so it ends up close to or far away from the dispenser end. The result is aggravation and waste. I'd much rather buy this in a jar or a regular squeezable tube. 

Fix the packaging and I'll gladly give this product top marks!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Very good suncreen,"This is the best sunscreen I have ever used. It left my skin soft and there was no greasiness. This is a better moisturizer than Glamglow Moisture Trip, which is what I use at night."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,:‚Äî/,the two finger rule leaves me looking insanely oily and there‚Äôs actually no possible way i can wear the accompanying moisturizer for this Hyaluronic Hydrating line because it will always pill up no matter what I do.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Very Happy,"I love PTR products. But admittedly, I‚Äôm one of those middle aged women stuck in their ways, and simply like what I like. I‚Äôve used the SPF 30 Defense Moisturizer for many years, but had recently noticed a change in my skin within the t-zone. I was hesitant to try this new sunscreen, but one of the associates convinced me otherwise and honestly told me she had yet try it, but heard lots of positive feedback. So, I gave it a go... I‚Äôm glad I did. On those days when I opt to wear sunscreen it feels like nothing is on my skin. It is literally weightless. I love that! And it makes an excellent base when I do wear makeup. No more shiny t-zone. I‚Äôd give this product 10 stars if allowed. Peter Thomas Roth hit a home run with this one."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Pills like crazy!,Pills pretty bad on my skin. If it didn‚Äôt pill I would like it a lot.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,I workout and sweat a lot. This product is very comfortable and it won't sting my eyes. It also keeps my skin hydrated. Definitely will buy again
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Not The Same as their Lotion,"I was expecting this to be the same as the ‚Äúwater drench hyaluronic lotion‚Äù that they make. It absolutely should be the same, because it shares the same name. Which is a logical assumption (and misleading on there part). The only difference should be that it contains sunscreen. I don‚Äôt see the same results using this product as I do from the moisturizer. I still have to use it until it‚Äôs gone, because it‚Äôs expensive... I was disappointed."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,great product but terrible price,"I absolutely love this product...except for the retail price. As someone with skin that has been more combo-dry recently, I‚Äôve found I much prefer my sunscreen and moisturizer to be one product than two because I can never find a sunscreen that is moisturizing enough for me. This product is so good!! It truly does feel like a light weight water cream moisturizer that sinks into the skin like it‚Äôs nothing but doesn‚Äôt make my oily spots too shiny. I will say that as I reapply it (ALWAYS reapply every few hours!!) my skin gets super dewy and I have to blot it, I don‚Äôt mind doing this but those with oily skin might. With that being said: if you have more combo- oily to oily skin, you probably won‚Äôt like this, especially since you need to reapply this so often. Another plus is that as someone with super reactive and sensitive skin: this did not irritate me or break me out, it actually healed a breakout I was having. 

I got it as a sample in the Sephora Sun Safety kit, and while I would love to purchase the full size, I just can‚Äôt justify the price for the amount of product you get. Why so little?? It infuriates me that brands do this - this product delivers exactly what it says and more, but I won‚Äôt be buying it because I can‚Äôt afford the price given that you go through this super fast with all the reapplication. The price is why I took off a star. If you can put down the money, then absolutely invest! Otherwise, there are more affordable options at the drugstore and possibly Sephora."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,"I have oily skin and break out easily on my forehead. I thought I‚Äôd give this a try based on reviews. I was sold on my first bottle, currently on my second one. No white cast, goes on light like a moisturizer, & I have not broken out since adding this product to my routine. This is a must have in my daily routine."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Not a great choice if you're going to cry that day,"This product was fine at first, it really felt like it sat on top of my skin. About midday we got some bad news about my cat, and I cried, and my eyes stung so badly that I couldn't look at my computer screen because it was so bright and I had to lay down with a cold compress on my eyes."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,I would definitely recommend you give it a try!,"So far this product has been great. I have dry acne prone skin. Finding a sunscreen that works well over other products and doesn‚Äôt pill up has been a struggle for me. This sunscreen has a unique texture that almost feels like you are applying cold water to the skin. It‚Äôs very refreshing. I haven‚Äôt really had a sunscreen I look forward to putting on everyday like this one. I‚Äôm also very picky about fragrance in my products and this particular product doesn‚Äôt seem to have any fragrance at all! I‚Äôm not sure I would recommend this to you if you have oily skin as it makes my dry skin look pretty dewy. But honestly, I love the glow. Another plus is that I haven‚Äôt seen any breakouts so far so I have my fingers crossed. It‚Äôs safe to say I will repurchase this product!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,best sunscreen I‚Äôve tried!,"I first got this sunscreen in the Sephora sun sampler, and then went and bought two more on the ptr site! Truly the best sunscreen I‚Äôve used. I have oily skin and medium skin tone and this is great. There is no white casts, it is dewy but can easily be made matte with a little powder. It works wonderfully under makeup and other products and has never pilled on me. I tried all the other sunscreens in the sampler pack and this is by far the best one. The price is definitely steep, but I‚Äôm willing to pay that price for a product that I actually want to put on my face. This is not like a white, sticky, smelly sunblock that you dread putting on. You won‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs on and you can easily reapply in seconds and not have to put in elbow grease to avoid that white/grey look. If you‚Äôre on the fence and reading reviews to decide, just get it!"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,I am obsessed,"I am an obsessive daily sunscreen user and I got a travel size of this in the Sephora sunscreen sampler. This sunscreen is absolutely amazing for anyone with dry skin. I‚Äôve gravitated towards more liquid textured sunscreens in the past since thicker ones always felt difficult to rub in. But this one has a similar texture to a light moisturizer and rubs in and spreads easily. It does not sting at all. And it leaves a dewy finish, but not greasy. The sunscreen scent is very faint. Now I can‚Äôt wait until I use up my (fairly substantial) sunscreen stash so I can purchase this full size."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,Don‚Äôt put anything on top of it. Will pill very badly
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Combination Skin,"Feels great. Applies clear. A few days in and the only issue is that my nose feels a little more oily than when I use the regular water drench. I picked this up to kill two birds with 1 stone moisturizer+SPF, and I guess a little slickness can be expected with SPF. I don‚Äôt look shiny though. I just feel shiny. I have not sweat with the product on, but it is something I will keep in mind based on other reviews. This rating is subject to change if it runs as badly as some people say."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,ew,"Ive never used a product that pills this badly, absolutely horrible. Ended up with more pilled product in my hair than I had left on my face, which completely defeats the purpose of sunscreen and is super gross."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Eyes burn,I think I have rated this one before but I‚Äôm rereviewing now. My eyes burn and become so watery!! Such a waste of money.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,SPF MAGIC!,This is an amazing versatile face cream for those who want non greasy SPF. If you have dry sensitive skin this was allow for deep hydration and doesn‚Äôt leave any white cast. Not greasy after wearing all day and goes GREAT under makeup. 10/10 recommend !
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,The best moisturizer with a SPF,"This has become my favorite all time moisturizer. It's very important to me for a moisturizer to have a SPF in it. Plus it's a bonus that it contains hyaluronic acid which is entirely new for me - I wanted to up my skincare routine. Before purchasing, I've read some reviews that people said it was more like a sunscreen... I would have to disagree with them. It does have a faint sunscreen smell when first applying it but there's no way I would compare it to the same thing as regular sunscreen. It absorbs nicely into my skin and leaves it smooth and moisturized. And to find a moisturizer that has a SPF of 45 is awesome. Typical moisturizer only has 25 or 30 SPF. I have fair skin and SPF is very important to me since I burn easily. I will be purchasing again and again."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,"Dry, sensitive eyes (Sjogren‚Äôs syndrome)","I was excited about this because I am trying to add more SPF to my routine and I loved the idea. But I have extremely sensitive eyes and even though I didn‚Äôt apply this near my eyes, I must have sweat into them because my eyes were tearing up all day and I tried it for several days."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,"I love the way this feels; not greasy or heavy like so many creams with SPF can be. I applied it in the morning and didn‚Äôt think about it the rest of the day. It was not irritating and very lightweight. It didn‚Äôt even out my skin tone or anything but it doesn‚Äôt suggest that it will do that - I think I‚Äôve just gotten a bit spoiled by Supergoop‚Äôs Matte Screen. I did like how this feels both when I apply it and once it‚Äôs on my skin a bit better than Matte Screen, though. I do think it helped moisturize my skin a bit without making me oilier."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Greasy,I tried this and no matter what it leaves me greasy. I tried to used as little as possible but still just greasy. Still hunting for a SPF that doesn't leave me greasy.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,BEST SPF!!,"I've tried so many spf's for my face and almost all of them I've either had a breakout, too greasy, or they leave me looking like I pained white paint on my face. This SPF moistruizer didn't do any of that! This is going to be my 2nd bottle purchasing this. I tried giving other SPF's another chance (only bc this is a bit pricey) but I ended up returning them and now I'm coming back for another 2nd bottle. One of my holy grail items in my skincare."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,I received a sample size of this product which I used religiously for 2 weeks and loved it. It felt wonderful on my skin! After enjoying the sample size I bought a full size. It‚Äôs awful! Has made me break out and stings my eyes. I don‚Äôt understand why there is such a negative difference! So bummed.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Full-Size Product pills/runs,"I‚Äôm super torn over this‚Ä¶ I had a deluxe size sample & LOVED it! The full size product seems like a totally different product to me - it pills and rubs off my face horribly! My face looks awful by mid morning, because I have this gross looking stuff in clumps all over that when I wipe them off, I just create more. So disappointed, but I really was excited based off the sample. This also tends to somehow run and then burns my eyes. Maybe it‚Äôs a case by case (or batch by batch) issue?"
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,"Probably similar to other sunscreens, but I bought this after seeing Charlotte Parler use this on Instagram. I love that it soaks in pretty easily and will use it alone or as a base before applying makeup or a mineral/tinted sunscreen on top of."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Best high spf moisturizer!,Hands down best combo spf and moisturizer. I saw a few people had the pilling issue I usually have with other products but have never had it with this one. I wear it every day and sometimes layer a primer and then tinted BB / CC cream and it‚Äôs so smooth! I recommend it to all my friends and the bottle goes a LONG way.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,There Can Only Be One,"This product does not work with anything else in my experience. It pills horribly when used in conjunction with anything else. So disappointed as I love the regular Water Drench moisturizer and was excited to combine products in one! When I use it solo, it‚Äôs great. Provides good coverage, feels lightweight, provides a good level of sun protection. I almost returned it but decided to keep it for times when I needed sunscreen in a pinch."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,"if I say yes, it is yes !",No white cast ! Soft smell ! Hydrating ! It worth the money ! I‚Äôd like to buy it again! I don‚Äôt feel any burden on my skin !
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,Honestly love this sunscreen!!! It applies super well over top other sunscreens without piling. It reapplies over itself really well too. Melts into my skin without making me feel oily. I leave this little sunscreen in my bag for reapplication on the go! It‚Äôs in a great little pump. Downside is cost. The are other better ones for cheaper.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,Best sunscreen out there. I sometimes use it under my makeup at night just bc I like the way it feels.
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Bumps on face and burning eyes,"I wanted to love this because it felt so good going on. But after the second day of use, my entire face is covered in little bumps, especially my forehead, and it burned my eyes so bad. It also made me look like I was covered in sweat all day. Would not recommend."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,"I got this as a deluxe sample in the sun safety kit 2 months ago so I wanted to wait to review this until I tried it a few times. No matter how I prep it, with or without anything, it just just too greasy! It never settled in and it did not protect me from getting burnt. I do not recommend this to anyone with combo skin that is fair skinned."
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Best combo facial moisturizer/sunscreen I‚Äôve used!,This product feels great on my skin. It does not sting my eyes. It doesn‚Äôt have any strong fragrance & does not leave any white cast. My face feels moisturized all day. I do apply makeup over it and have never had pilling - but I use liquid spf foundations & apply with a brush. No powder foundations for me.  I love this stuff!
PETER THOMAS ROTH-Water Drench Hyaluronic Hydrating Moisturizer SPF 45,USA,Good product but pricey,"I always use a hyaluronic acid product due to where I live. To find one with spf is an added bonus. 

I was surprise how this absorbs into my skin ( I live in the desert). It feels silky and whip-like which I felt I had to use more product than I should. Doesn‚Äôt smell bad and to be honest it didn‚Äôt really have a noticeable smell.

This worked ok for me. It is expensive but if you want to splurge then it‚Äôs a good product."
EST√âE LAUDER-Perfectionist Pro Multi-Defense Aqua UV Gel SPF 50/PA++++,Singapore,"best sunscreen, ever.","As someone who hates everything about sunscreen (the smell, the texture, the shiny effect left on skin) this is it. It feels like nothing after you apply it and has zero smell. Sadly, they discontinued the SPF 50 :( and only have SPF 30 now (but why?!)"
EST√âE LAUDER-Perfectionist Pro Multi-Defense Aqua UV Gel SPF 50/PA++++,Malaysia,sun expert ,I never wanted to use sub expert cause I like my bare face but it gave me a goosebump that after applying this I got a bare skin with extra glow.love it

EST√âE LAUDER-Perfectionist Pro Multi-Defense Aqua UV Gel SPF 50/PA++++,Malaysia,Strong Scent,"Love how it is SPF 50 and water based. Perfect doe dry skin peeps. However, the scent is absolutely strong & can be a put off for some. Would not recommend to use it as a primer but it does the job of a SPF for dry skin. "
EST√âE LAUDER-Perfectionist Pro Multi-Defense Aqua UV Gel SPF 50/PA++++,Singapore,Might repurchase ,Might repurchase this. I think normal to dry skin will appreciate it better than oily skin as it feels very nourishing. No cast at all when applied- totally clear. Kind of pricey for only 30ml. Good thing ab this is the high spf coverage. 
EST√âE LAUDER-Perfectionist Pro Multi-Defense Aqua UV Gel SPF 50/PA++++,,didnt do much,"it's ok, but too expensive to be just an okay product. did not work well as a sunscreen as i developed more freckles. the texture it sticky and difficult to absorb. but no breakouts and works well under makeup."
EST√âE LAUDER-Perfectionist Pro Multi-Defense Aqua UV Gel SPF 50/PA++++,,the sunscreen that i am looking for ,my combination skin works well with this sunscreen. my skin tends to perspirate with any product application especially on the T zone. with this product it is less oily on that area. after about 4hours of application i noticed my skin had an oily blot on chin. reapplication is advisable. 
SULWHASOO-UV Wise Brightening Multi Protector,Singapore,best best best ,"best sunscreen i‚Äôve used - i‚Äôve tried others at similar price range but always stings my eyes , doesn‚Äôt cover well, or is heavy or makes me sticky

SULWHASOO-UV Wise Brightening Multi Protector,Singapore,Meh,"For this price, there are many more sunscreens that are easier to use. I think this would work better for drier skin types, as I have oily skin in a humid climate, this was way to heavy for daily wear. I just wore it indoors. "

SULWHASOO-UV Wise Brightening Multi Protector,Malaysia,not the best,"Not sticky and only mild tone up effect. The biggest problem I have with this product is that it forms white clumps like eraser dust on my face (even if I‚Äôve tried many different ways of blending and apply small amount). Very disappointed, would not repurchase."
SULWHASOO-UV Wise Brightening Multi Protector,Singapore,Creamy glow ,"I think this product is not bad for a sunscreen. I have oily skin and I use this sunscreen, it‚Äôs not oily when applied. Even after sweating it does not produce white peels and it‚Äôs still not oily. Can just wipe your sweat with a tissue. Everything is good about this just that it‚Äôs too pricey. "
SULWHASOO-UV Wise Brightening Multi Protector,Singapore,good product,"Bought this to try as a sunscreen, works well as a make up base. Smells nice just like Sulhwasoo‚Äôs vitalising overnight mask, herby and calming. Consistency is creamy but doesnt feel oily upon application, will buy again."

CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,A nice luxurious cream.,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have been using this cream with my evening routine and have been enjoying it. It has a lovely consistency, a pleasant scent and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. It is a very pricey product as all products in this line are, but I do find them to be very similar and comparable to other Shi Seido products and skincare lines. Personally I would likely opt for those products over this one simply due to price point and because I get very similar results from Shi Seido products as I do with these. There may be long term benefits that I am unable to comment on, but based on my experience so far, these are lovely products."

Cream is rich and lightweight which is great for dehydration. The weather in Vancouver was still quite dry so this helped tremendously with my nightcare routine.

CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Leaves skin glowing but not for combination skin,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product for free from @influester and from cle de peau in exchange for my honest review... unfortunately I really tried to like this cream but it literally made me breakout. This cream does feel super soft but for my combination skin it just didn't work. Also there seems to be some mica in it cause it left my skin bling looking like I was just dusted with sparkly dust in my face. This cream is thick but it doesn't feel super heavy. It does have a light scent which to me smells like most shiseido products I use (hard to describe). I do think that this cream would benefit those with normal to dry skin vs. Combination.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Cream - 50 ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I liked the feel of this cream on my skin but I actually find I need a bit more hydration. I am coming out of winter dry skin season so this might be better for me the rest of the year. I did find it really light and you could tell it was made from quality ingredients based on how well it felt on my skin. Not greasy at all.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Cream - 50 ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a lightweight feeling gel-cream consistency with that signature Cle de Peau scent. I found this was not hydrating enough for me - I used it at night and my nose started to feel dry an hour after; I used it in the daynight and by the time lunchtime came around, my cheeks and forehead felt dry enough that I needed to reapply my moisturizer. A nice texture for a moisturizer but this would likely work better for someone with normal to oily skin, and not my dry dehydrated (and sometimes flaky) skin."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,"Rich, yet lightweight","(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The Intensive Fortifying Cream is indeed a rich, luxurious cream that leaves my skin feeling so plump and hydrated. I was worried that because the cream is so rich, it would feel very heavy on my skin. But I was quite pleasantly surprised by how lightweight it feels. This cream is definitely wonderful for those with dry skin, as it provides so much hydration without feeling greasy. It also layers very nicely on top of other products and does not pill. After using the cream for a couple of weeks, my skin feels so smooth and soft."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,luxurious hydrating moisturizer,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) My skin gets dry after washing my face and this serum makes me feel fully hydrated and glowy after. I feel my skin is effectively hydrated after applying this cream.

This face cream is thick and very moisturizing without feeling greasy. Before using the cream, my skin was dull and yellow. After applying the cream, my skin looked more smooth, plump and radiant. Since it has a thicker texture, I would recommend using this as a night cream. This is a great face cream I would recommend to friends and family."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Great night cream for mature skin,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This was a great addition to my nighttime skin routine.

My skin so needed this cream especially the winter times. It intensely moisturizes through the night.

CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Amazing cream!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is one of the most lux moisturisers I‚Äôve used and I might have to bite the bullet and splurge on getting the full size.

It‚Äôs nice and thick, but very creamy and easily works into the skin and absorbs it immediately. It‚Äôs non-greasy at all, which I love (especially with oily to combination skin, I don‚Äôt like applying creams that are giving me grease ball vibes and having the possibility of causing breakouts)! I layer this cream on on top of my serum, but only at night because I like thicker creams for more skin hydration when I sleep, and lighter creams for the daytime."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Cream - 50 ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Loved this cream. It‚Äôs so thick and moisturizing. You only need a tiny bit to do your whole face and neck. I haven‚Äôt noticed any difference in regards to anti aging but I my issues are mostly dry skin.
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Soft and hydrated,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received sample size of this product from Influenster  and frankly speaking this is just as good as it requied  for my dry skin.

CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Absorbs well,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This cream is nice to smell, it has that luxurious smell that's not too overwhelming, in my opinion. I have dry skin, especially during winter, it gets even drier. Once applied, the cream absorbs well into my skin. It doesn't have a too thicky feel. You will see greater results when used at night before sleep. To be honest, I feel you can easily replace this cream with a cheaper option."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Cream - 50 ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The intensive fortifying cream was VERY hydrating. I appreciate that since I have quite dry skin, especially in the winter months.

CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Cle De Peau Intensive Fortifying Cream - 50 ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Isn‚Äôt really worth the price if I‚Äôm honest. You could get the same results with a CeraVe moisturizer and without side effects from fragrance if you are sensitive to fragrance. WAY too fragranced in my opinion. Just a normal moisturizer, there‚Äôs nothing really special here."

I‚Äôve used cle de peau‚Äôs products before and have always been impressed with their products! I love moisturizing creams but I feel like you need to give it some time to see results.

CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Not moisturizing enough,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I also got a very small sample of this product to try. The cream was a bit thinner than what I‚Äôd normally like, so I had to use more on my face. Even then, the cream didn‚Äôt feel like it provided enough of a barrier to keep my skin feeling hydrated."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Not bad,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

This product was ok for me. I really needed to use it twice a day to get the hydration my skin needed. I don't feel my skin is dry, but this product wasn't hydrating as much as I needed. My preference is a heavier cream though so if your skin is used to that this may not be the product for you."
CLE DE PEAU-Intensive Fortifying Cream,Canada,Hydrating and Firmness,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I am so thankful to have gotten the opportunity to try this line of products. This cream, I don‚Äôt need to use after using the hydrator and serum BUT this is perfect for adding some additional hydration and firmness to targeted areas. It is thankfully scent free and I feel immediate results upon applying to my face. That being said, its key to note that consistency is key.

The cream is definitely powerful but luckily it isn‚Äôt heavy nor greasy so it pairs well with my combination, sensitive skin."

I think it leans towards a more neutral undertone? For reference, I‚Äôm a 260N for the Rare Beauty foundation, MW2 or MW3 for Issy & Co, and Baikal for the Ilia tint. This is for sure a good supplement to your SPF since it also gives amazing protection! I also have oily skin so just shake this well and mattify with powder. "

SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Singapore,Not for all skin types,Not ideal for my combination skin as it has a tacky texture. Even as a fan of the glowy and dewy look this is an overkill for my skin type. Make-up slides off and I am taking such a long time to finish it because I only reach for it when I go make-up free (i.e. weekends or WFH days). 
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Hold the bottle upside down,"Like others here, I had issues with the pump seeming to stop working, even with plenty of product left. I took it apart and realized it might work if I held the bottle upside down while pumping it out into my hand. Much better, and it explains the weird bottle shape. Supergoop added a sticker to shake well before using; they should add instructions for this too. Otherwise, I love this stuff, makes my aging skin look refreshed and healthy."

SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Philippines,Vitamin C is not for me,"My skin reacts to vitamin C or maybe just to this product that I get bumps and pimples after using this product. It also has a shiny finish on your face so if you like a matte finish, try the matte one that always gets sold out! "
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Great for makeup free days,"I can certainly understand what many of the reviews are saying about this product, but I do love it. I use this at home on make up free days. It has not broken me out in the greasiness does go away after a while. It‚Äôs true it‚Äôs not great underneath make up. But it has a time and place in my skin care routine. I would re-purchase this product."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Malaysia,SuperGood indeed!,"One thing that I like about this sunscreen is that it is watery unlike other sunscreens that are thick and leaves a white cast on your face. This doesn't, you can just pat it on your face and it absorbs pretty quickly"
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,not a keeper,"I thought I would really enjoy this product, basically having a 2 in 1, but I did not like it. I wanted to save time in the morning by having vitamin C serum and a first layer of some SPF, but the overall product was not a keeper. I can never tell how much product I have left in the bottle. Plus it never felt even full. The smell is medicinal, and texture is tacky. When it ‚Äúabsorbed‚Äù into my skin it left it very shiny and tacky. I felt like I had to pump 5 squirts just to cover my face. Maybe it‚Äôll work for others, but was not impressed."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Philippines,worth it,I can get away with just a small amount of product each day. I think this is so worth my money. It‚Äôs not too thick or sticky! I love the finish and I see myself buying it again.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,sticky and ‚Äúpills‚Äù,"Ew, so sticky I can‚Äôt stand to use it. Am trying to get my money‚Äôs worth by using it up on my arms but even there it makes my skin feel tacky and rolls off when rubbed."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Singapore,Love it,"It's light and easy to apply. not sticky, not too thick. the only thing down side is there's a slight smell of the typical Sunscreen but all in all, it's good!"
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Malaysia,Oh the glow!,"I don't go out without putting on my supergoop serum. Not only does it provide protection against the harsh sunlight, but it also leaves a noticeable glow on your skin which I am truly obsessed with "
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Singapore,sticky slimy and doesn‚Äôt stay ,It‚Äôs so sticky and thick that it doesn‚Äôt t stay what I applies on it and I don‚Äôt see any improvement after trying to use for 1 month in order not to waste the moment ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,REGRET THIS PURCHASE,"At first, I really liked the concept of Having sunscreen infused with Vitamin C but it didn‚Äôt do very well on my skin. It‚Äôs very greasy and sticks on the hands too. On top, It made me breakout. DO NOT RECOMMEND!"
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Might work for some but not for me,"As a sunscreen, this works. As a serum, it works. That's the only reason that this is getting two, rather than one, star. 
I really wanted to like this product -- the serum/sunscreen combo is one I'm usually a fan of. However, this stuff smells...yeasty. It smells like an english muffin that's been toasted and sprayed in banana boat. I get that it's fragrance free and that's great, but the scent that is present is offensive enough that it's turning off a lot of people who would otherwise be open to using it. It's also NOT for oily skin types. It's very wet and it takes forever to dry, and it's also very thin and liquidy so it can run everywhere. If you have dry/normal skin, don't mind strong and maybe unpleasant smells, and are looking for an effective sunscreen and serum, then this could be for you. But it isn't for me."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Oil Slick,Feels great but it would only work for me in dry winter climates. It made me sooo oily.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Feels sooooo heavy and it NEVER drys!!! Worst spf I have ever bought!
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Singapore,Brightening skin,"After using the product for a few days, notice skin feel slightly lighter.  "
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Philippines,double purpose,"this sunscreen + vitamin c is a good combination. however the product doesn't mix well upon shaking and appears separated once pumped. it's also very sticky, so if you put it on your hands before applying to your face, most of the product is left on your hand. for an expensive product there's a lot of waste. doesn't have a very good texture once applied. "
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Absolutely Not!!,Worst sunscreen I have ever tried.  The smell was very intense and atrocious.  The consistency is extremely oily.  It has the look of spray butter when it comes out of pump; that's even after shaking it for 2 minutes prior to pumping it.  Not to mention just after one use it broke out my skin terribly.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop Lover,I love Supergoop products so I was very excited to try their serum. I‚Äôm honestly not sure if I‚Äôve noticed a change BUT I do feel like my skin is getting better sun protection than with just sunscreen alone. I did not find it greasy like other reviewers mentioned. I will be purchasing again!
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Singapore,Liking it,"Serum and sunscreen perfecto. This is a to go serum for the sunny days and when you don‚Äôt need to separate two skincare. I‚Äôve bought and tried this in actual size. For days where I‚Äôm using this, i simply skip my serum steps! Great for wfo mornings hahaa!"
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Singapore,Not greasy,Does not leave a layer of white residue unlike some other suncreens. Quick and easy to use! 
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Malaysia,Supergoop,"Very runny texture. Once applied my face feels sticky and looks extremely oily even after use of blotting paper. On the plus side, it didnt clog pores or cause any acne outbreak. Perhaps more suitable to be used in cold weather. definitely not for hot climate."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Singapore,too oily,"The serum is so oily that I can't apply too much on my face. But if I don't apply enough, it won't work as a sunscreen. If you have oily to combination skin, I don't recommend this."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Read the directions,I didn‚Äôt read the directions at first so I was putting it over my moisturizer as the last step in my routine. It was clumpy and gritty and I didn‚Äôt understand why it would get good reviews and it‚Äôs not the standard of supergoop that I‚Äôm used too! I finally read the directions and holy cow. What a difference! It feels so smooth and my skin looks brighter and I‚Äôm only moderately consistent. I‚Äôm so glad I figured it out because it‚Äôs now a staple!!
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Shiny and sticky,"Made me look very shiny, but not in a glowy way. I just looked oily.   It also made my skin feel sticky.  My skin tends to be on the dry side, so I‚Äôm not sure who this is going to work for.  I do like their other sunscreens, but this one is not a winner."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Singapore,FITNESS TRAINER,I HAD USED A FEW SUPERGOOP! SUNCREEN AND THIS IS FAR MY BEST PICK FOR MY DEHYRATED AND COMBINED SKIN. IT GIVE MY SKIN A LITTLE GLOW BUT NOT TOO OVER OR SHINY. JUST A HEALTHY GLOW BEFORE MY PRIMER. BUT I PUT IT ON FOR 15 MINS BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE FOR IT TO BE FULLY SET.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Made me breakout,"I love SuperGoop! and have tried many of their products but this one just wasn‚Äôt it. It made my skin more dry, left a weird texture on my face, and broke me out."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Let it sit for a few minutes!,Love it! My new go to! I used the play everyday lotion from supergoop. It was fine but it used to be really greasy. Tried this at the store and while it goes on a little greasy it dries after a few minutes giving you a subtle glow! Gorgeous! Love it!
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Singapore,SPF serum,It‚Äôs like a moisturiser for my combo skin type. After first application my face got oily hence forth only used very little. So far no irritation caused however didn‚Äôt really like the texture. Guess will use it till I am done and over with. Maybe it‚Äôs ideal for colder climate. 
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,So greasy. Not for anyone who doesn't have oily skin!!!
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,"Product separates; doesn‚Äôt help to shake before use. By the end of the bottle I‚Äôm pretty sure all of the sunscreen had separated and been pumped out, and I was getting whatever the pure clear grease was. Cannot recommend."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Malaysia,Amazing Product ,I've been using this for around 3 weeks now and I see a good difference. I feel like this product has helped me with my acne and skin texture is so much better
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,good concept but greasy formula,"I originally bought this to combine my sunscreen and vitamin c step into 1 step. But this sunscreen made my skin greasy and shiny and not in a glowing dewy way. My skin is not naturally oily. The pump is not well designed either. Sometimes when I use it, the product squirts everywhere. The liquid comes out looking separated even from the beginning. I like the concept of this product but it‚Äôs too greasy for my skin."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Leaves my skin soft and glowy!,"This goes on a little heavy, so I apply in the morning and then let it rest for about 15 minutes while I do my hair and get dressed, THEN apply moisturizer and makeup. After it's been on my skin for that little ""waiting period', it feels really soft and healthy, and the coverage still feels good. I think this might be a little bit *too* heavy for acne-prone skin, but if that's not a concern, I think it feels very rich and healthy and protective. One star off because while the wait is worth it to me, it is certainly slightly inconvenient when I'm in a hurry."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Singapore,Perfect for my combo skin,"I have combination skin and this sunscreen with vitamin C gives my skin a super beautiful glow. If you like a matt look, this is not for you. This glowy look highlights in all the right area and the fluid texture (1 pump and a little bit more) makes it easy to spread. You'll be be able to see which part you missed out on because of the lack of ""glow"". I don't get breakouts and wouldn't hesitate to stock up on this!"
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,I just bought it with my another account. The liquid only fulfill half of the bottle. It‚Äôs still greasy even though  it‚Äôs already more refreshing than most of the supergoop product line.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,I bought this on a whim and I've been using it after lotion on my body and I LOVE the results. I have pretty bad hyperpigmentation and KP on my arms and I feel like this has really helped with hydration and reducing the hyperpigmentation.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,"Decent product, awful packaging","The product itself is OK to good - I was trying to cut down the steps in my AM routine and a combo Vitamin C and SPF seemed great. The texture is a little odd - it doesn't look mixed correctly when it comes out, but I mix it in my hands to apply. It doesn't leave my skin tacky, sticky, or shiny which is a miracle for SPF! However, the worst part of this is the packaging. The tiny little pump means product spills either all over the bottle or sprays all over the counter and my clothes. Whatever way it's distributed inside, I was barely halfway through the bottle and had to tilt it to get product out our it would pump dry. Awful packaging. I tossed the other half."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Philippines,Goopeeeee!!,Very nice product! I wasn't expecting that I will be more than satisfied!
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,it‚Äôs a ‚Äúno‚Äù for me,"I wanted to love this but unfortunately it didn‚Äôt work out for me.
I had to return it because I noticed my skin slowly reacting to it after 2 days and now my face is getting rashes around my mouth, eye and cheek area‚Ä¶
I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm cautious with what I put on my skin but I wanted to incorporate a type of oil but not anymore.

Also, vitamin C is an ingredient that‚Äôs very difficult to stabilize and I learned that it also isn‚Äôt effective when mixed with spf, so if you‚Äôre buying for the benefit of that, I might as well skip this.

If it works for you, great. But you honestly won‚Äôt know until you try it. It didn‚Äôt work out for me, so I‚Äôm giving it a 1 star.."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Love the texture and finish. I have dry skin so this was a great first step in my skincare routine.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Malaysia,sticky ,Very sticky. Hard to control as when you squirt it it‚Äôs very dilute and runs through the fingers. Also I didn‚Äôt think well enough before purchase. We are used to putting our serum first and then moisturizer and lastly sunblock. But in this case does it mean I should skip moisturizer? Pretty confuse. Also very sticky. Prefer their other formula. 
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,pretty good for tan people.,It smells like sunscreen almost like a diluted sunscreen. Felt like water. It‚Äôs not bad but the smell is strong so be mindful
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Philippines,Ms,the smell. it reminds me of the old school sunblock from beach hut and irritating to the eyes. but it kinda softens my skin. will not consider buying again
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,"Helps give me a dewy, natural finish!","This product has given me exactly what I wanted. If you don‚Äôt want a glowy look, don‚Äôt buy this. I use this as my first step after cleansing, followed with moisturizer, then glow screen. It gives me the perfect dewy, natural look I‚Äôm going for. I have normal to dry skin. It has also helped even my skin tone. I‚Äôve had acne through my mid-twenties and this is definitely helping me recover from that."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,"After using it for a while I definitely do see improvement in my skin. The nozzle is a nightmare, I dislike how it comes out of the bottle. It does give you a very dewy look.. someone asked me if I was hot because It looked like I was sweating. LOL"
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,"I use it with their mineral spf powder and it works great. I have a combo skin and was worried about breaking out and looking greasy. If you plan on using it on its own, and have oily or combination skin, I would not recommend it. But if you use it along with their spf powder, you‚Äôll love it!"
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,May be ok for the super dry but for my combo skin it was a nightmare. I‚Äôm sticking with unscreen sunscreen by the same company. That goes on like velvet and is completely matte
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,"It‚Äôs alright.. however I always have a pilling issue when using this product. Other than this it did well, never broke me out even tho it feels super oily and leaves you looking very dewy."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Singapore,highly recommended,"i usually don't like wearing spf everyday because they feel sticky, but this product is so light and with the vit c i've noticed my skin starting to even out... "
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Too oily!!!,Don‚Äôt recommend at all. Feels like applying oil on my face. And it is so greasy. Absolutely a no no product.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Love it. Perfect to start a dewy look. Also love that it is 2 in 1.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Not for me.,"While I love the idea of a combo product for a quicker morning routine, I wasn‚Äôt a fan of this product. I found it very sticky. Also, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was using enough to get any sun protection. Save your money."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,not in love :(,"I'm such a fan of supergoop's other sunscreens that I had to give this one a try and oof I was disappointed. I'm not sure if it's my skin type or if it's the product, but I look greasier than a butterball on Thanksgiving after applying. It never seemed to soak in either. I really wanted to love this since it has SPF + vitamin C, but I guess I can't have it all."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,it works great,"I ordered this because I loved the idea behind an spf and vitamin C in one! If you plan on to use this as your only spf for the day, I recommend using this as your last step in your skincare routine. My face is definitely brighter and more youthful after using this product! The only con is that you absolutely need to set your face with setting powder afterwards. I usually just conceal my under eyes and add Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood filter to my cheeks and forehead. I definitely have to make another step and set my face with setting powder to cut the oil/shine on my face. I‚Äôm ok with adding the extra step to my routine but it would be nice if I didn‚Äôt have to. Great product but 4 stars for being super oily."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,"Love all so supergoop‚Äôs stuff, but stay away from this one if you have oily skin. I was left looking like a greasy chicken nugget after about an hour"
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Too oily,"Very oily, even i have dry skin it still pretty hard to go thru my skin. this sunscreen way too much oily absorb very slow made my skin feel uncomfortable and sticky. I wouldnt rec to anyone. Now i have to use i for body instead of face. :("
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,TOO OILY,I really wanted to like this but was so oily.  I thought it would be more like a serum.  I guess maybe good for someone who‚Äôs dry but this did not work for me.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,People are saying I am glowing,"I acrually like this. People are saying my skin is glowing. Not oily, but glowing. It is a bi-phase solution so shaking it helps with consistent dispensing. But I will keep using."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Horrible packaging- but will repurchase,"Here are the facts:
Packaging? Horrible. The pump gets stuck and its hard to get the product out, I have bought it 2 or 3 times but it happens every time.
Formula... people are right, it does not absorb quickly and it makes you glowy af. This can and will make your make up look oily if you put it on top. HOWEVER... I love it anyway. I use this every morning and night if I can, and it makes my skin look smooth, glowy, evens out my skin tone, it is also one of the FEW SPFs that don't break me out. I follow up with concealer and a mattifying pressed powder when I need to and it gives me a perfect natural finish.

I will buy this again, but beware of the cons!"
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Not What I Was Hoping For,"The packaging on this product was so poorly thought out. Since it's a curved bottle with a short pump when you try to dispense product it doesn't all go onto your fingertips because you can't put you can only put one finger under the pump and this is a very liquidy formula. You have to pick it up and tilt it to dispense better. Considering how expensive this product is and how little product you get I'd hope that would have at least been better. As for the formula, it's greasy and takes what feels like hours to sink in but if you're reapplying as often as directed it won't ever fully absorb. I haven't tried this with makeup on and I have no desire to considering how greasy it is. It seems like makeup will not mesh well with it, but I'm not sure since I didn't try it. Overall, I was expecting so much more since I like their unseen sunscreen."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,"Hydrating formula, but unless you have lots of sun damage or noticeably uneven pigmentation you won't really notice the efficacy of the Vitamin C. Really great concept but it doesn't absorb well into the skin and ends up in the eyes which will cause stinging. Wish I could love this product."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,please don‚Äôt buy this,Supergoop is a great company I have other products that are mind blowing (like unseen sunscreen) however there is something really wrong with this product. The consistency is bad not like normal creams but weird water. The effect on the skin is also not good. At the beginning it seems ok but at the end of the day my face looks more tired and off than usually. My face doesn‚Äôt like this product and I don‚Äôt recommend it. I wish I bought their unseen sunscreen instead of this.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,I love this stuff.  You do have to shake a bit before using.  It‚Äôs like their oil sunscreen with Vit C and reflective particles..   it makes me look like I am glowing.  I will mix it with a bit of foundation if I feel I need some coverage.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,yeah naw,"This isn‚Äôt for me. At all. Supergoop‚Äôs daily dose vitamin c sunscreen is much heavier than your average serum, though not as heavy as a thick cream or pure oil. 

I bought this in hope I could get some for my mother, who hates skincare and would love an all-in-one product. 

But it feels like pure oil on my skin. When I wear it, I skip moisturizer all together. Despite this, it feels so heavy and boreline sticky on my skin. I hate it so much. I‚Äôll be sticking with my og vitamins c serum and Supergoop‚Äôs Unseen Sunscreen. It‚Äôs the only way to go."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Usually love all of supergoop‚Äôs products but this one broke me out:/ I was so sad returning it and thought the formula was revolutionary because of the SPF but if you break out don‚Äôt buy this
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,"Great glow, Horrible packaging","I love the glow that this sunscreen gives me, however the container is horrible. the pump. constantly gets stuck, there's no way to open to top. I have so much more product inside that I can't get to because the pump won't work. Very disappointed for how much money I spent"
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,works okay. But it gives ur skin an oily touch and it's very overpriced.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,"TEEEEENY TINY bottle! Like this is wildly overpriced. Cute packaging and nice formula but it‚Äôs not earth shattering, and should not cost this much."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,I didn‚Äôt not notice any change in skin. I bought this for the vit C + spf combo and it just was not amazing. Will more than likely not repurchase. I prefer the glow stick by supergoop.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"Not worth the money, honestly I can get way more product from a SPF else where. It leaves residue and doesn‚Äôt lay well under makeup. It has a super strong smell that I cannot get used too."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Not worth it,"I pretty much never write reviews, but this product was so bad I felt like I had leave one. I received a deluxe sample of this product. It was horrible. The product was so greasy and left my face a complete mess. I might as well have sprayed cooking spray directly on my face based on how greasy it was. I tried it on 3 different days with the same result each time. Even after giving it plenty of time to soak in (+20 mins by the 3rd attempt) it still basically made my makeup slide right off. I wasn‚Äôt even able to make it through a full day before I had to wash my face and start over because it was so bad. I‚Äôve never had quite this same experience. I don‚Äôt know what they put in this thing but it is ridiculous. If I could give it zero stars I would."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Best vitamin C,"I love this product. It brightens your skin, hydrates and protects all in one. Best product ever."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Love this product! Have noticed a difference in my skin and like that I can skip a step in my routine since it is serum and SPF in one. Definitely give it time to settle into your skin before you apply makeup or another product or else you will feel greasy.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,meh‚Ä¶,It‚Äôs fine but it is very oily and can be confusing as to where it goes in a routine due to that.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Oily and thick,"This formula is very sunscreen like, but not the good kind. It makes my face very oily, greasy and sticky. I liked the concept of spf and vit c in one, but it is not lightweight and serum-like unfortunately. Would not recommend."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,I was excited to buy this because I would save me time in my skincare routine in the AM with vitamin C and sunscreen in one. I am very disappointed with it. My face looked shiny all day and the amount you get for the price was not worth it. I would not buy this again.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,I love that this product is clean but it made my face so oily!! Well not try again. To be fair I have combination skin so maybe you should only try it if you have dry skin.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Doesn't fit the hype...,"I was hoping this would be a good fit, but this was just too oily for me. It felt more like a really sticky SPF; It didn't have a serum consistency in any way. It doesn't feel like an even split of vitamin serum and SPF honestly. It felt my skin shiny all day, and my skin didn't react too well with it. The formula just didn't work for me, && I really wanted it to.."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,time saving glow,"I actually love this serum‚Äôs texture and definitely wouldn‚Äôt describe it as ‚Äústicky‚Äù. I mix a couple bronzing drops in it and warm it up in my hands before pressing it on like a serum. I consistently used Vitamin C before trying this, so I‚Äôm not sure I saw huge results, but I love that it‚Äôs 2 steps in 1. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôd buy this again."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,moisturizing,I rather like this spf and that I don‚Äôt need to apply an extra vitamin C serum. Other people complain that it‚Äôs a bit sticky‚Äîit is but I use hyaluronic acid serum after I wash my face so for me the sunscreen glides on pretty easily. I haven‚Äôt noticed any improvement of my skin tone but I have not had any breakouts or negative reactions so I‚Äôm happy. I like how supple my skin feels after applying this and I find that I‚Äôm hydrated all day. I would buy it again!
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Texture is not great,"I wanted to love this so much and I‚Äôm giving 4 stars simply because of the convenience factor of a vitamin c serum paired with spf - one less step in a beauty routine! However, as other people have mentioned, the texture is not great. It‚Äôs sticky, and the stickiness definitely lingers even after a few minutes to allow for absorption. I typically remain barefaced after sunscreen and vitamin c but if I were the type to use foundation or concealer, I would not want to use it on top of this product - seems like a recipe for clogged pores and break-outs."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,"I‚Äôm a black woman and this sunscreen/serum is amazing. I substitute it for my moisturizer and it works wonderfully. You don‚Äôt need much. I see this product has a lot of mixed reviews, but honestly I feel like it could be because ppl aren‚Äôt using it properly. If you are oily, you should use this by itself and if you‚Äôre super dry, you can also add in a moisturizer. This is my honest opinion. It is not a paid review. Just wanna give you all a diff perspective on it.  :)"
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Super Thick on skin,"When I saw this product I was very excited as it combined my two am products. Unfortunately, when i put it on my face, it was super thick and cakey. My skin felt like it had paint on it, and all i wanted to do was wash it off. I don't wear a lot of makeup on my face, so i am probably extra sensitive to this, but it is way too thick for me to wear, and I will be sticking to individually adding Vitamin C serum and sunscreen."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,greasy,I wanted to love this but it has an oily finish and makes my face super shiny and greasy feeling
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,Feels very oily especially the longer I had it - didn‚Äôt mesh well with my moisturizer either
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Love it,I received this product complimentary from Supergoop. I really love the consistency of this product. Feels very light on the skin. It really hydrates skin. I am very pleased with it. I highly recommend.
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,Supergoop! Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,"I am 41 with normal to dry skin that breaks out with nearly every sunscreen I try, and I absolutely love this one. No breakouts at all, it is beautiful to prime the skin before foundation. Leaves a youthful glow to my skin. I don‚Äôt use other moisturizers with it as I get plenty of moisture from just this. I use 2-3 pumps and it heavily coats my face. I have to work it in. I don‚Äôt notice a smell at all on my skin."
SUPERGOOP!-Daily Dose Vitamin C + SPF40 Serum,USA,i really like this,"i don't know why this has such negative reviews!! i have been using this for a few months and really love it. i have super dry skin so i really don't mind that it has an oilier/more dewy consistency. i probably would not recommend for someone with oily skin. i also layer on top of some other serums, so i don't have a problem with tackiness. i used without additional spf during the winter, but when the uv index is higher i layer more sunscreen on top as the last step in my skincare routine. tl;dr this is great for dry skin if you want extra glow and hydration with built in sun protection!"
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Oily and Pills,It is too heavy on the face. It feels as if you are applying oil on your face. And it‚Äôs pills on top of your skincare. Definitely would not recommend unless you have chronically dry skin!
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,I really like it but I wouldn‚Äôt buy again,"I do like this product because it hydrates my skin and I get to avoid that step of my skincare routine (I was a beginner), and even though it feels saturated at first, when it dries well it doesn‚Äôt feel that way and adds a very natural and pretty glow to your skin. The problem is that after a few retouches it becomes too much, and it‚Äôs pretty bad for oily skin like mine."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Best physical sunscreen,This is the best physical sunscreen I have used. It did not irritate my eyes (I am very sensitive to chemical sunscreens). It is a beautiful pinkish tinted texture which blends wonderfully with my skincare (I have relatively fair skin). Will repurchase.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,ms,Extremely greasy and not for humid weather. Hair sticks to it like glue and feels tacky on skin all day. Impossible to use and very disappointing. If you have oily skin stay away. 
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Good pick!,"2x buying this!  Yes, I have CC and mineral ones that are thick, not this one. 1-2 pumps for my overall foundation and love it!"
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Oily,Made me feel oily and shiny 
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,DO NOT BUY,This is absolutely terrible. It‚Äôs a super liquid form which I can‚Äôt stand and it makes you look as white as a ghost when you put this on. I returned this the next day. I have been using Bliss and will continue to use that instead. Sucks bc I wanted to love this.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"Wow. Just wow. Amazing product overall. I tried it in the morning after my simple morning routine and went on my skin flawlessly, doesn‚Äôt require much blending at all, doesn‚Äôt pill, doesn‚Äôt look oily (and I have oily T zone and normal skin on my cheeks) looks glossy but not oily. Doesn‚Äôt look oily throughout the day either, when it‚Äôs time to reapply it goes on smoothly without any pilling and doesn‚Äôt look gross. I even decided to reapply with makeup on and it looks great!! I‚Äôm actually really surprised it looks perfectly fine over makeup (I don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup). I have light acne prone skin on my T zone for reference. 10/10 would recommend."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Never felt like it absorbed well on my skin and it made me look very oily. The sheerscreen was so much better and would not purchase this again. Also hated the packaging! Top would not stay on so would be terrible to travel with.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,I recommend!!!,"I love this sunscreen! I'm not usually to use tint sunscreen and when I went to store with my cousin, she showed me this one and as soon as I put in my hand it was WOW!!! I love the texture and the coverage. I'm not a makeup person so this product it's perfect. Light coverage and that's it."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,natural and not heavy or sticky,"I have acne issues and this doesn‚Äôt trigger anything. Its more shiny than usual sunscreens BUT if you are gonna wear foundation on it, its all good. Doesn‚Äôt crease or have white clumps as you add on product "
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"Love the product , but the pump doesn‚Äôt work well. I have had this issue before. I thought If I order again it won‚Äôt happen. So I can barely get and product despite pumping and pumping. Basically Poor packaging, otherwise I think the product is great."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not worth the money,"I really wanted to love this sunscreen. I really did. But every time I attempt to apply this product, it starts to pill up. I barely rub it into my skin and it is rolling up and sticking to my hands. I have tried to use this sunscreen both with and without products underneath, nothing changes. I think it is a formula issue. I would recommend the Unseen Sunscreen or the SheerScreen over this one."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,works for me!,I have very sensitive/fair skin and I feel this is the first face spf that has worked well for me. I like that it‚Äôs tinted so that I don‚Äôt have to wear anything on top of it. The applicator pump is great too and a little product goes a long way! Will definitely purchase again.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,not for sensitive skin.,"not for sensitive skin, gave me contact dermatitis. and was very drying."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,The hype is true!,Goes on smooth with no white tint. The slight pink color blends beautifully with my skin tone to make my complexion look more even.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,finally!!,"Shocked at how much I love this! I have very sensitive, acne prone skin and this is the first sunscreen that leaves my skin better at the end of the day. Very silky, sets as a dewy but not greasy finish and works well under my NARS foundation"
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,Awesome!,"Finally a brand that has a zinc sunscreen in their line of products!! Easy to use, even under makeup.. Great colour tint, making it a great product to use by itself if you would like to still look great without any makeup!"
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,I didn‚Äôt like this at all. I don‚Äôt like the tint. It stained my beach bag & my shirt. I ended up throwing away the rest of the bottle.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Glowy but tinted orange,Super hydrating and glowy but I can‚Äôt wear it in the winter because it tints my skin so it doesn‚Äôt match my neck.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,New Favorite Physical Sunscreen,"I was looking for a more cosmetically elegant physical sunscreen and this product hit the nail on the head. I was nervous to buy this because of the comments about this product pilling, but haven‚Äôt had any issues at all. I use this between moisturizer and primer + makeup and have noticed zero pilling so far. I have warm light to medium skin and this product does leave my skin with a bit of a pink tint. The pink tint can easily be covered with makeup but also isn‚Äôt super obvious on my skin and would be fine to wear out without makeup occasionally; definitely doesn‚Äôt leave a noticeable white cast like other physical sunscreens I‚Äôve tried."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Philippines,Zincscreen,"This product has all the good ingredients you are looking for a suncreen, my only problem is it doesn‚Äôt go on very smooth or when you rub on your face after moisturizer kind of hard to blend it.  "
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Do not buy! Pills and leaves residue on fingers,"I bought this after testing it out on the back of my hand in store. Liked that it didn't leave a white cast or have an oily finish so I bought it. Went back to my car and put it on right away and was disgusted by how much residue was caked on my hand after applying on my entire face. I would say more ended up on my hand than on my face! Since I was still in the parking lot, I went back into the store and returned it for another sunscreen."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,wow,I have wanted to get this for the longest time but am very torn with the many reviews. but one of my friend who has dry skin loves it so I thought I can give it a try! love this sun lotion so much! it does moisturize my skin and also brighten it a bit.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Pills really, really badly","This product pills really badly. I have tried it with everything and every single time it starts to pill straight away when put onto skin. It's so hard to get this to work, and I feel like it does not really absorb in any way it just sits on top of the skin, does not really dry down. I would say it's a waste of money."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,love it,Love it so much. Easy to put on the skin. Supergoop never fails with its sunscreen. But I prefer the mineral ones. Less one star because of the price though. 
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Mrs,I like this sunscreen..not sticky and make face look glowing 
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"Love this stuff! I have SUPER sensitive skin and this felt great on my skin, it did nothing but wonders from protecting my skin to keeping it hydrated. Will definitely purchase again."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Singapore,big fan of the brand,"I love Supergoop! as a brand in general, and love that they are a no-frills sunscreen brand that doesn‚Äôt try to do too much from making a great sunscreen. This is my holy grail and a great product!"
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"It certainly works as a sunscreen - no burns, even on sunny days in LA - but I wouldn‚Äôt purchase this again. I have combo skin, and in drier spots, this formula cakes up. When I tested it on my hand in-store, I was really excited - I was purchasing it to replace my beloved Solid & Striped sunscreen serum, and of the sunscreens I‚Äôd tried since Solid & Striped discontinued theirs, it seemed the closest - but it really doesn‚Äôt moisturize, and doesn‚Äôt mix well with moisturizers. It really looks awful on my face, bummer for dry skin. Still looks / performs well enough on my hands, though!"
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"Ok I put this on and was feeling myself.. liked the finish and the feel on my skin. However, my friend pointed out it looked WAY darker than my skin tone. I was so embarrassed. So if you‚Äôre pale or super pale like me‚Ä¶try something else. I had to return it."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not the Spf for me‚Ä¶,"As much as I wanted to love this product for its good spf protection, I could never fall in love with it. The texture is too greasy for my liking and it seemed to dry out my skin after an hour. Sadly, won‚Äôt be repurchasing."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Overall the product is ok. I didn‚Äôt think it provided a blurring effect for me and noticed it started pilling when I applied the product.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Amazing SPF lotion!,"This lotion does what it says - it protects the skin, has got clean ingredients and is safe for everyone/thing. The amazing bonus is that it will not leave a white cast! It is a sun safety product so it is not designed to be a primer for makeup or applied after makeup. I use this after I apply my Glow Recipe Pinapple C Bright Serum as it corrects dark spots but also requires sun protection. I do not wear a foundation with this lotion as it simply would not work (I'm still wearing a mask outside anyway...). I have combo skin and this lotion gives my skin a nice, even, glow - it will sink in after an hour so applying makeup after an hour could be done (not with oily skin I think). It is the best SPF lotion I have tested! I had zero issues with the pump/packaging as mentioned by various reviewers."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Save your money!,"This stuff is TERRIBLE. I am a huge fan of the Matte Screen, so when I saw this new product I decided to give it a try. However, it is really difficult to apply without it pilling up all over - I found I had to put it on immediately after my moisturizer while my skin was still damp in order for it to go on well at all. It has a really slimy texture that leaves a residue on your fingers, and left me extremely shiny and oily looking. This is a no-go for me, and I would not recommend it to anyone."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,disappointed :/,i got this as a gift and was so excited but was quickly disappointed as it started to break me out. The texture of it was super oily and leaves an uncomfortable feeling. I have semi-dry-normal and sensitive skin and just really bummed out that it didn't work.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"Change the packaging!! I would have gave this a 5 had it not been for the packaging. You can open the bottle and the pump doesn‚Äôt always want to work which leads to product waste. The sunscreen itself i love. No cast, didn‚Äôt pile for me but i also didnt layer tons of other products underneath it. Its great for my dry skin i dont think oily skin people would like the oily feeling of the product but for me it works amazingly. Leaves a shiny finish but im totally fine with tat because this feels and looks so much better than most other mineral sunscreens. Im willing to buy this again i just wish they change the packaging."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,fabulous!!!,"No white cast! Because I am quite tan, I was worried that the mineral base of this sunscreen would seep through the very light tint that it has. Thankfully this was not the case! Amazing product, easy to blend. I use it to prime my skin before applying the supergoop cc cream, and it works very well!"
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Let down of a product,"I bought this hoping it would work for my sensitive skin. While it didn't irritate me, it didn't seem to protect as well and I ended up getting burned or got super dark and splotchy in some places just from being out in the sun for an hour. I do tan easily but I also burn and I am very generous with my sunscreen applications from head to toe. I haven't used any acids for 4 months and haven't exfoliated in 2 weeks so my skin wasn't prone to being hyper sensitive to UV rays. This week I had 2 pumps of this spf 40 on my face, neck and chest and some spf 30 on my body and faced away from the sun most of the time and my face still got burned which turned into really dark areas and looks like I'm wearing foundation thats too dark for me. Not to mention this stuff doesn't smell to great. I'll use it up but will definitely follow up with another sunscreen and won't repurchase."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,What the‚Ä¶.,"I don‚Äôt write reviews ever but this product is so terrible it warrants a review. It‚Äôs watery. The color resembles calamine lotion, who looks good with that on your face? It gathers in big goops, puddles of sunscreen on your face. It NEVER dries down. It just eventually turns into elmers glue and is super sticky and shiny like a disco ball on your face."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Decent Mineral Sunscreen,"I‚Äôm on a hunt for the best mineral sunscreen in existence.  I‚Äôm over the heavy, paint like, white types.  This on is light, with a bit of a pink tint.  It goes on smooth and doesn‚Äôt flash (on my pale skin.). My only negative is that I want something I can pull down my neck and chest, and this one can rub off on some tops."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"I bought this from another retailer. Upon receiving it, the cap does not work: it is a bit too small, and I cannot put the cap on. so now I'm left with this product that can only be used at home. I cannot travel with it.

I don't know whether it is effective: short term speaking I cannot tell if the sunscreen works for me. 

In terms of the texture, it is not the best. It just ""sits"" on my skin. When applying it, I don't feel like it is being absorbed or anything, and hours after applying it, I can rub it off easily with my fingers."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Love this so much.,"I have extremely sensitive and normal-to-dry skin that over produces oil if it is slightly irritated. I have used SPF from sooo many brands, including other Supergoop! products and have struggled deeply. Most broke me out, turned my face into an oil slick, and/or felt so heavy on my skin. Based on the reviews, I expected this to the same. But, it didn‚Äôt! This is a very light fluid that feels completely weightless, you cannot see it on the skin at all, and even though it feels a tiny bit oily when it goes on, it absorbs beautifully in about 15 minutes. So, I put it on, drink my morning tea, and then continue with makeup. Love this so much. The only thing I would change is to bump up the protection to SPF 50 PA++++. But seriously, that‚Äôs it. I love that it‚Äôs clean, I love that I can use it while breastfeeding. Five stars."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Best Sunscreen Ever!,My favorite sunscreen ever. I turned 27 last year and have gotten super serious about skin care. This absorbs into my skin very well and sets a perfect foundation for my makeup. It also doesn't smell sunscreen-y (thank the lord). I have purchased this multiple times and it never fails.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Repurchase,"I prefer mineral sunscreens, but it can be difficult to find one that preforms well and is esthetic. I love this one. It‚Äôs light weight, blends into the skin well, and tint helps minimize any white cast. It reapplies well too. I definitely recommend it!"
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"It looks good on, but feels terrible to apply. It leaves a gross residue on your fingers. I have to use a brush to apply it because I don't like the way it feels with my fingers. I apply it with just moisturizer underneath so I don't experience pilling. It looks dewy with a very slight tint on my face. It looks good under makeup. But I don't like applying it so I will not repurchase."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not good for oily or medicated skin,"I'll say that this review is HIGHLY personal. If you have dry/combo skin, it might be great for you.

I have combo/oily skin, but am using tretonoin, so parts of my face are in the peeling stage. I put this on after moisturizer and my looked so shiny, and the liquid formula make it hard to spread without getting the peely skin all over my face (yuck). 

I really have been liking the sheer Unseen Sunscreen - it goes on smoothly with no residue - but I wanted to try a mineral sunscreen because I've read that chemical sunscreens can contain harmful ingredients. The FDA has not determined the full effects of chemical sunscreen ingredients and are still testing, so I am going back to the Unseen until I heard differently."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,HOLY GRAIL!,"This sunscreen is amazing. I have very sensitive combination skin which leans on the dry side with an oily t-zone. I also have rosacea and perioral dermatitis. I am just now beginning to add skincare back into my routine due to a long exhausting road to treating my perioral dermatitis. This sunscreen does not irritate my sensitive skin at all and in fact seems to be helping it! It is not greasy at all. Zero white cast. It blends right into my skin after about 5 minutes to a completely natural finish. Not matte, not oily/greasy/shiny. It‚Äôs literally perfect. I will say it‚Äôs not very moisturizing. I‚Äôve been wearing it alone but did wear it with my moisturizer one day and had no issues but felt a bit more moisturized overall. Otherwise my face gets dry with this alone. Also the tint to this blends right in to match my tone yet also almost blurs imperfections for a more even tone. Truly an amazing sunscreen. I hope they never discontinue!"
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,not sheer,The tint is a really strong. I‚Äôm mixed race and this leaves a white sheen on my face.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"Meh. As I‚Äôm writing this review, this product is out of stock. I don‚Äôt quite understand why. I had high hopes for this sunscreen. It might just be my combination of products but this pills a lot unless I fully let my moisturizer settle into my skin. It‚Äôs also quite greasy, I find, which isn‚Äôt great for someone with combination skin to start with. The only reason o haven‚Äôt returned this product is because I think it could come in handy for reapplying sunscreen throughout the day (if I have to go outside). I use another mineral sunscreen in the morning that leaves a bit of a white cast. I spend a considerable amount of time rubbing and blending that in before putting on my makeup. I don‚Äôt mind this but I obviously can‚Äôt reapply that same sunscreen on top of my makeup. So my plan is to carry Zincscreen with me if I have to be out in the sun, so I can reapply it."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Didn‚Äôt play well with moisturizer. Pilled like crazy and anything I touched before wiping/washing my hands got the color all over it.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"low-maintenance glow, functional protection","Holy grail product since i retired my last holy grail daily sunscreen (Clinique Pep Start - still a great product, but owned by the Lauder fam, so no more for me.)

Not as finely textured as Pep Start, but otherwise feels very similar, goes on much the same, leaves a similarly dewy, moist, glowy finish. If you prefer a matte finish or a finish that truly dries as it sets, this likely isn‚Äôt going to be your fave product‚Äî but, if you‚Äôre 45 like me and are finding that the natural glow of your teens & 20s is harder and harder to come by, you‚Äôll love this.

Basically functions as a tinted moisturizer but with a secret superpower of fully functional mineral sun protection‚Äî it‚Äôs most of my daily face needs in one bottle. I haven‚Äôt used it with makeup (haven‚Äôt needed to), so i don‚Äôt know if it pills when functioning as a layer. I‚Äôd be worried that it wouldn‚Äôt stay put under other things, compromising the spf‚Ä¶ but again, i haven‚Äôt tested it in a layered situation, it just feels like that might be an issue.

SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Sensitive Skin Summer Staple,"This mineral sunscreen is ideal for my dry combination skin. it gives a great glow I am very fair,great for pale to medium tan skin tones. My skin is super soft after I apply and does not clog my pores. Definitely a summer staple"
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,This sunscreen left little balls of goop on my face - didn‚Äôt love it.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Greasy Mess,"After hearing so many raves about Supergoop, decided to try the brand again. My first try was a spray that clogged & splattered unevenly. This time I tried the tinted lotion. Honestly the color is good for me as I am pretty fair. It feels super greasy and I don‚Äôt know how I would get enough on my face to be protected as 1/2 a teaspoon just keeps sliding around my face like the aftermath of a oil tanker spill. It migrates to my eyebrows & hairline for something to hold onto."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Still got sunburned,"This looked great on my skin, no white cast and it blended in great. Unfortunately, I still sunburned while wearing this."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Wanted to love it,"I tried this on my hand first and decided to get a sample. It does leave a slight gold hue on your skin, but it dissipates fairly quickly and it worked well with my skin tone. It is creamy in texture and takes a bit of rubbing to work into your skin. It left a matte finish on my skin and at the same time i felt like my skin looked dirty in a way. Hard to explain. It smells like foundation to me which I didn‚Äôt like. The smell did go away after a little bit. Overall, not impressed for the amount and the price. Tried several sunscreens from this brand and I‚Äôm and I‚Äôm not impressed."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Go to sunscreen. Doesn‚Äôt break me out even with my super sensitive skin. I use 3 pumps every day and it took me 3 months to go through a full one so I feel like I‚Äôm getting my money‚Äôs worth
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,I really wanted to love this sunscreen. The tiny is prefect of my very fair skin it feels very light weight on my skin doesn‚Äôt cause any irritation or breakouts. But the biggest thing that bugs me is how bag this product pills up on my skin. I plan to finish this product and the not repurchase in the future.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Hmm,"I really wanted this to work for me, however it didn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt recommend this product to anyone as it feels heavy when applying it. You really have to work it in‚Äîwhich is fine‚Äîbut just feels greasy. In addition, the tint rubs off on all your clothes even hours after application. So, those shirts you‚Äôre wearing, make sure to pre-soak to ensure tint pigment come off! 
I do, however, appreciate that this is a non-nano Zinc product. 
Try the Murad one instead, which has an even higher SPF and PA rating."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Pills unless moisturizer is dry!,"Nice sunscreen. Pills if you don‚Äôt wait for your moisturizer to dry before applying it. First time I used it I had to wash my face again it just completely pilled. Feels pretty comfortable on my sensitive skin. Not much coverage tint but definitely no white cast. I would buy it again if the others that I‚Äôm trying don‚Äôt work. Also got a sample of the Clinique Pep Start tinted mineral spf so I‚Äôll see how I like that one. I also tried the Supergoop Glow Screen which I‚Äôm not a big fan of as a solo product, but it was okay layered over my Saie Slip Tint spf."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Great Sunscreen, Useless Cap","Great product but taking off a star for the packaging. Been using for two years and have yet to get a bottle where the top actually fits. Would be so much better with a functional cap! Otherwise, love and will keep using."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"When I was looking for a sunscreen, I needed one that met a very specific criteria. I wanted a sunscreen that was mineral, reef-safe, non-comedogenic, vegan and not tested on animals and SPF 40+. And so, I came across this sunscreen. Overall one of the better sunscreens I've used. The application is very nice, leaves no white cast whatsoever. I like the glow it brings to the skin. The only complaint I have about this sunscreen is that it was a bit greasy throughout the day. Other than that, my experience with this sunscreen was very good."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,BEST SUNSCREEN EVER ‚Äî it goes on COMPLETELY clear. Best mineral sunscreen ever
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Opinion from someone who lives in the desert,"I‚Äôm in my mid 30s and with combo skin. I‚Äôm fairly happy with this lotion. It absorbs quickly ( probably because it‚Äôs super dry where I live) and the slight chemical smell goes away quick. 

I usually wear this under my mask and usually when I‚Äôm out with my kid for 1-2 hours. I have not worn it with foundation /other make up. 

This was actually given to me from a good friend who is familiar with what I use and need."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"I love that this is mineral sunscreen, but too moisturizing for me personally. It didn't fully absorb into my skin. I will try just a sunscreen without moisturizer. This may be for someone with dry skin or if you're looking to replace your moisturizer and sunscreen with this single product"
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Pretty on skin but feels greasy!,"This sunscreen adds a glow and a nice blurring effect to skin. My only complaint is that it stays fairly greasy, which isn‚Äôt so bad if you live in a cold dry place or you have dry skin. It‚Äôs definitely a winter sunscreen for me, probably will finish the bottle but probably won‚Äôt purchase again."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"I really wanted to love this and gave it so many tries, but it pilled so badly every single time. You literally can't put any skincare before this or it pills like crazy."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Perfect!,This is the best sunscreen I have every tried. It¬¥s light and has a nice colour to it that will fit every complexion. I love that it is a mineral SPF but doesn't leave a white cast.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,I love this sunscreen. My favorite thing about it is that you don‚Äôt have to tug on your skins to spread it around your face. It takes some getting used to but it‚Äôs my go to daily sunscreen and I‚Äôve had no problem with pilling as others have mentioned.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Perfect for my mid-thirties combination skin,"This is my HG sunscreen. I am lighter complexion with a yellow undertone (I am mostly Irish, Italian and black) and this blends in nicely with a rosy sheen that is not sparkly. It soaks in after application in two minutes or so. In summer it may be a tad too light for my skin tone, but I‚Äôll cross that bridge when I get there. It moisturizers my VERY difficult to moisturize skin (nearly everything breaks me out except aloe) and compliments my retinol well in controlling any breakouts. I use a tad on my eyelids and it also seems to stay put. I am going to buy several bottles in case they discontinue!"
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"I really wanted to love this. It felt great on my skin when I tested it out, but it does not layer well with other skincare. It pills like crazy."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,for winter,"It has a nice glow but it is greasy. Even though my skin is dry, I don't think I can use this in Spring and Summer. However, during Winter, it gives a nice moisturize glow."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"I love this sunscreen! It‚Äôs in my top 3 favorite sunscreens (and I‚Äôve tried a bunch!) This is my one and only favorite tinted mineral sunscreen because it works well with my neutral skin tone (I find that a lot of tinted sunscreens nowadays have a warm tone that just doesn‚Äôt work for neutral and cool skin tones.) It adds a nice glow without being greasy and it prevents my skin from getting oily throughout the day. It feels hydrating and it‚Äôs fragrance free! Won‚Äôt sting your eyes, either."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,A mineral SPF I like!,"I love how this looks on a no makeup day! It just very slightly evens things out and gives you a glow (I have oily skin and its not too much). I dont know how it looks on darker skin tones but the tint is very light and its a runny lotion consistency, not a cream so I think it would work for most. 

Love having a mineral spf option that I actually like using. This also works really well with the Kosas tinted face oil and doesnt make it break up. I will say if you have dry patches or peel sometimes from retinol (like me) this does sort of cling to it and more so if you reapply it but its not  bad at all. Overall really love this one"
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"The first time I used it I was very turned off because a clear oily liquid came out with some specks of pigment. I also thought the texture was very oily the first time I used it. Over time after shaking before using, making sure to press into my skin, and let it sink in for about 5 minutes before applying makeup I really enjoy it. I use about 3.5-4 pumps for my face and neck and it‚Äôs only 1.7 ounces so I don‚Äôt know how long it will last. I do love that it‚Äôs pa+++ I generally really enjoy it. Definitely would more recommend for normal/dry skin."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Give it a chance!,"I feel like the review on this product don't do it justice. It's a great mineral sunscreen. It has a light tint that matched my fair skin and lightly covers my redness/ smooths my complexion. It does take maybe 5 minutes to fully dry down and I think the best way to apply is by patting into the skin. It does work well under makeup, just want until the sunscreen is DRY to apply and it will look great and does not pill. Overall its a great sunscreen that does well for my combination, sensitive skin."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Leaves beige residue on fingers,"This sunscreen does not play well with moisturizer. It applies smoothly without pilling but it leaves this beige residue on my fingers! I end up having to wash my hands with soap every time I apply sunscreen. To be fair, I did try applying it to my skin without moisturizer and it absorbed fine. However, I have dry skin and this SPF by itself is simply not moisturizing enough."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Not a fan. Pills up no matter what product I have on under it from my skincare routine. A huge disappointment and wish I had just gotten the Unseen one instead.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,greasy,"Bought this yesterday and with just one use I don‚Äôt like it at all. Is very greasy, doesn‚Äôt absorb full, it‚Äôs stays on the skin, sticky. Don‚Äôt like it at all."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Smooth,"Smooth application and no shine. I have a dark skin tone but it does not leave a white cast. However sometimes I find that the formula tend to clump up especially if I wear gel moisturiser underneath the sunscreen.
Need to shake the bottle well before pumping it out, or else only oil comes out...at first I thought the product was spoilt hahaha
Does not clog pores and safe for sensitive skin"
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not worth it,"I don‚Äôt think this is worth the money. It doesn‚Äôt go on smoothly. When smoothing it on, it pills.... best I can describe. It doesn‚Äôt smooth on like a cream/lotion. I have to spread it out and then pat it in or it starts pilling. It also doesn‚Äôt have a great smell. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for oily skin. I have combination and using it in the summer made my skin feel greasy. I might try another one of their products, but wouldn‚Äôt repurchase this one."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Sat on my skin like oil - not good!,"I really wanted to love this, but unfortunately it shall not be. It sat on my skin like oil. It has no staying power whatsoever. It pilled miserably. After 20 minutes I could sill rub it in. I was shocked! This gets two starts because the tint was my right match. Other than that  this subscreen is terrible. Walmart offers better subscreens than this."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,BEST FACE SPF EVER,"Best face sunscreen ever. Stays on, isn‚Äôt greasy, and sits wonderfully under makeup. Will never wear anything else. A glowing FIVE STARS."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Not for me.,"Does not work for me. I don't know why. But it just sits on my  skin and I feel it. It does not absorb into my skin skin. It also pill / flake off my skin. I'm not applying a lot either. I love other supergroop! products, this one just did not work."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Returned it--too dark!!,"I returned this product because the tint is way too dark for my fair skin.  The texture and the smell seem nice enough, but I just can't wear this because it makes me look ridiculous."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"It has some tint, so it comes off on the mask we all have to wear now. It has a funny smell but it dissipates.  I like it."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Breakout Free!,"The only sunscreen that doesn‚Äôt cause me to breakout! I have tried the unseen one by supergoop, all of neutrogena sunscreen, blue lizard, some Korean brand, aveeno, kids sunscreen, Drmtlgy and no luck until I found this. It was recommended to me by one of the Sephora employee. She said her mum uses it and it doesn‚Äôt make her break out. 
Cons: I have brown/Indian skin tone and wish there was a darker shade. I also have a very oily skin and this is a dewy sunscreen."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,It would get clumpy if I would not let my moisturizer settle in before applying this product. Also if you do not like transfer this product is not what I recommend. But other than that it is a great product and it does what it serves to do.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"I gave this 5 stars as 5/5 for a mineral sunscreen. I don‚Äôt like mineral but when I‚Äôm preg, I won‚Äôt use chemical. This does not leave a white cast. It works well alone and under makeup. It has a tint but it‚Äôs nice on my super fair skin. It doesn‚Äôt break you out and it provides every day protection (I would use something heavier for beach)."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Love the weightless feeling but pills up easy which makes it difficult to work with. Leaves the skin looking dewy which is pleasant but not worth walking around with orange-ish flakes on my face
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Malaysia,Not a great product,"When I had bad breakouts, so I thought that a physical sunscreen might help with the condition. At first, it works out greatly, then after using it for a while, this sunscreen has been irritating my skin, causing itchiness and redness. I do not recommend this to any sensitive skin user. "
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Great coverage, dewy finish, can cause breakouts",This is great but it definitely leaves me with little bumps at the end of a long day of sweating/work. I recommend this for beach day makeup or if you know you can wash it off in <12 hours.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,‚ÄúRadiant‚Äù finish for normal to dry skin,"If you like a ‚Äúglow‚Äù or ‚Äúsheen‚Äù and have normal to dry skin and a pale to medium skin tone, then this sunscreen is perfect for you. Unfortunately for me, I was not into the ‚Äúglow‚Äù or ‚Äúsheen‚Äù this gave my oily skin. Too bad, since this brand only offers 2 products without chemical sunscreens, which irritate my sensitive skin with mild rosacea. (But both of those - the MATTE SCREEN and the CC/BB CREAM - are good. The CC/BB CREAM is just a little glowy, while the MATTE is... well... relatively matte, for several hours, until my oils finally break through.) 

This did not leave a serious white cast behind... but then I have fair skin, so that may be why it wasn‚Äôt an issue for me. And any ‚Äúpaleness‚Äù was easily covered with a lightly tinted setting powder or a light dusting of powder foundation. 

For me, this is a no due to the finish, but for those that like a ‚Äúradiant‚Äù look, this might be a product to try."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Perfect Every Day Sunscreen,"I really love this as a daily sunscreen. I find it easy to apply, it leaves a pretty slightly dewy finish on my skin with no white cast and it works well under makeup. I haven't notice any greasiness or pilling like other users - I usually use my fingers and pat it in to apply 1-2 pumps. It is expensive for me, but I haven't found something cheaper that I like as much. I do think it's more of a basic daily sunscreen and you might need reapplication or a stronger sunscreen for an all-day outdoor adventure (I've ended up with a red nose after a day at the beach just applying this once)."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,Leaves terribly oily film that doesn‚Äôt absorb and leaves your face looking shiny and not in a nice dewy way.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,It does NOT burn your eyes!!!,Love This! It gives your skin a sun-kissed look while protecting it from UV rays. And I was personally looking for a sunscreen that I could wear ALL day without it seeping into my eyes and burning them halfway through the day. This does the trick! I love it! I will repurchase! I am ALL about my skincare and ALL about my SPF!!! Keeps me looking youthful.
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Supergoop! Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,"I love the protection. I wear everyday that I go out. Sometimes, it is the only make-up that I use besides some blush and eye make-up."
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,"Thank you, Supergoop!","Tried a lot of different mineral sunscreens from different high to lower end brands and this one is the absolute best in my opinion. Especially considering the fact that it's a physical screen and does not give you a cast at all. In fact, it has this light tint that somehow manages to adjust to your skin color. Love, love, love!"
SUPERGOOP!-Zincscreen 100% Mineral Lotion SPF 40 PA+++,USA,Terrible sunscreen,This is the worst sunscreen I‚Äôve ever used. I‚Äôve been working out outside because of the gyms being closed. This sunscreen does not even hold up for an hour. My face has dark streaks from where the sunscreen came off because of sweat. This is the 3rd sunscreen I‚Äôve tried from this company and they‚Äôve all been bad.
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,Malaysia,Not a fan!,firstly it smells bad..and the texture is urghh! i bought it because of d reviews but i would say this is one of the worst purchases ive made for skincare. will not buy and probably throw out the one i have.
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,Malaysia,Favourite ,"Love this sunblock,one of the best ive tried. It helps with my make application too, not sticky nor oily. you only need to use a lil, it goes along the way. Highly recommended "
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,Malaysia,good,The texture is nice but I don't feel its mattifying enough. It is has no white cast. I'm using as skin care. Not for matte look make up. Pricey though 
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,Malaysia,Flower,I love this Alpha H Daily Essential Moisturizer SPF50+ with Vitamin E. A good quality product that makes my skin so hydrated and it thus improves my skin texture evenly so well.  A very good and highly recommended product .
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,Malaysia,heavy texture ,"I use it daily and apply it whenever my skin sweat. FYI, I have combo skin and this product doesn't breakout my skin. Hence, I love it. It does make my skin fairer. "
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,Malaysia,Because the vitamin E,"I like this moisturizer because it makes my skin glow and after that I can wear a matte foundation, it's worth it because when wearing a thin foundation there is no spf actually"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,Singapore,after applying will have white cast and super oily,"this is the first time i give a bad review, like i said, after applying the cream on my face, the white cast is so obvious, my face become oily face.... "
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,Malaysia,Great help,Love it. Ease my morning routine. As we skip one step. Wish I knew this earlier. Highly recommended for busy mothers out there who juggling between home and work. 
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,Australia,smells like sunscreen,I am forever on the hunt for sunscreen that doesn‚Äôt smell like sunscreen. This one wasn‚Äôt the one. Can comment on the sun protection this gave me and I didn‚Äôt notice any changes in my skin when I introduced this into my routine. To summarise... meh.
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,Malaysia,protect my skin,"3 in one item, suit my combination skin, feels soft and moisturise my skin and also got SPF, i don‚Äôt need to use many products for my skin. Easy to use everyday can‚Äôt wait to repurchase again"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,Malaysia,love,"I love it so much, but its a lil bit pricey for its size. it made my face looking dewy after using it. it really moisturized my face. really love it so much. "
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,Singapore,It was OK,"It was a not so bad product. It was not one of my favorites, but I didn't have any problem wearing it. I will not buy it again though cause my skin feels oily and stuffy. But maybe it was just my skin"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,Malaysia,Not Crazy About It,I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about this product - it makes my makeup look a little weird. My skin looks darker for some reason. I don‚Äôt think it performs as a moisturizer.
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,Malaysia,my travel companion,"This is as what i wanted. I always change products for moisturiser+spf to put in my everyday handbag. Because i always reapply everytime i wash my face (for prayer). So this is one of my fav moisturiser+spf combined. Texture just nice not too watery or gel like or sticky. It is white in color but no whitecast. Size below 100ml great to go on flight too!
"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Not for me,"As far as moisturizing goes, I think this one gets the job done. However it leaves my face feeling greasy and my makeup doesn't do well over it and I'm not going to change my entire makeup routine just to accommodate this product so I don't see myself buying this again in the future"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,More sunblock than moisturiser,"I bought this, thinking that it would kill two birds with one stone to have a moisturiser WITH SPF. The texture feels more sunblock than moisturiser and there's a slight white cast if you don't blend the product in well. Not sure if it works well to moisturise although skin does feel a bit greasy after application."
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Great,Great for days when you want minimal product on your face as it‚Äôs a moisturiser with spf. I‚Äôve sensitive skin and had been using it for the last 1 week and so far my skin hasn‚Äôt broke out. 
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Nice moisturiser,"I was looking for the moisturiser that has high SPF, because I don't want to put too much stuff on my face, especially the day I stay at home. This one works as a moisturiser and suncream, so I solved my problem. Its absorbed quickly and non-sticky at all. "
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,it's essential,I really like this moisture because you don't have to wear any additional sun block. Spf 50+ is enough for Malaysia's sun. It's very time consuming and save lots of money too. 
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Best SPF moisturiser there is,When it comes to skincare I'm all for convenience and time-saving and this product does exactly that since it's an all-in-one moisturizer with a good amount of SPF. The consistency comes out thick but it's easy to apply on my face and it sinks in fast.
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Good purchase,I really love this! It provides good protection and isn't greasy at all. The price is a little steep for me for a small bottle but it does it's job wonderfully. 
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,A multi tasker!,This moisturiser left no white residue moisturised really well and I was out in the hot sun for half a day and my skin didn't tan burn or peel. A keeper!
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,good!,"The only moisturiser that suits my face..... Wont make your face oily and not gonna be cakey if wear under makeup!!! Some more its hydrate your skin....will repurchase and homy grail
"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Pretty good,"I like that it does not feel sticky on my face after applying it. The contents is not a lot though, and it smells like regular sunscreen. 

Overall, it's good, but not great"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,all time fave!,"by far the best moisturizer ever! 
together with SPF just made it easy for me to use daily. 
i like moisturiser with SPF combination. this does not leave any white cast and really have a smooth finishing.  
"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,2in1,this serves as a multi purpose step to selfcare - moisturiser and sunblock rolled into one. i use this to supplement my moisturiser so i get added hydration.
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,No white cast or residue!,"This is my daily moisturiser/sunscreen, and for SPF50 at 50ml it‚Äôs also priced very fairly. Alpha H is a brand I really like, and this product is a perfect complement to protect the skin after Liquid Gold goes on. Non oily, non greasy, and no white cast!
"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,good spf,its a good spf protection. finished the bottle and bought again as it does not break me out. the texture isnt the best as it can be quite sticky and oily looking but powder on top works.
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Basic Moisturizer,"I was looking for a moisturiser with spf and this came out from my search in sephora so I decided to try it. I don't particularly like it, it is just a very basic moisturiser, not sure if it did anything else to my face..."
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,awesome,The perfect sunblock moisturiser on a sunny day. I also apply this while out for swimming. A little oily in texture. Can use under foundation or powder. Keep ur face in a moist condition and protect from sunburn the whole day 
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,decent,"This sunscreen is not oily.. Glide easily and absorbs quite well into the skin. However, it makes my skin become oily after a few hours. I tried this without any make up on and it does make my skin more oily in few hours.. And I don't like its smell.. "
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,slightly greasy sunblock,"I needed a sunblock to complement some glycolic peel lotion I was using, and Alpha-H looked like a good brand to try based on reviews. 

I generally avoid sunblock as they make my face very shiny and greasy. unfortunately, this sunblock had the same effect. it's not as heavy as other brands of sunblock, but consequently, I've had some cystic breakouts on the forehead and they're taking a much longer time to clear. I can't help but link my newly greasy face to the breakout. 

I know sunblock counters ageing from exposure to UV, but seriously, why must the trade-off be a face that now looks like it can reflect sun rays back at other people?"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,"be wary, sunscreen nerds","This goes out to sunscreen nerds out there! 1. The sunscreen in this product is primarily Homosalate. 2. The listing claims that this product is broad spectrum however there is no indication of this on the actual product or its box - nothing that says broad spectrum, UVA/UVB, and no PA factor either. 3. I‚Äôve been using it for over a month now and 7/10 times it does ball up on my skin. 4. It has quite a strong sunscreen smell and I found it lingered. 5. While it was moisturizing, it was not hydrating so I had to put on a hydrating cream underneath. 6. I like the dispenser as it is sanitary and easy to control however the cap has nearly chipped away to nothing and I‚Äôm fairly dainty with my hands. The verdict? I‚Äôll finish it up but will definitely not be repurchasing."
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,My favourite moisturizer,"I am very picky with my moisturizers, because I don‚Äôt like the oily, tacky feeling of some moisturizers, and at the same time I dislike feeling like I didn‚Äôt put anything on at all. This product strikes the perfect balance. My skin feels moisturized and protected but never heavy"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,i m loving the feel of this product ,I bought this by going through all the review . I also wanted a moisturiser and sunscreen 2 -1 combo. This product is not sticky unlike other sunscreen. This is easy to use non greasy and at the same time your skin is moisturised and protected from the sun . I luv the fact it has SPF 50 . 
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Love it! ,"I have acne-prone, super sensitive skin & an oily T-zone. This product leaves my skin matte and feels light on the skin. It won‚Äôt leave your face with white residue & the smell is not too strong. So far, no new breakouts from this product and that‚Äôs kinda rare for me! "
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Best for everyone and those starting to wear SPF,"I'm not going to start on how crazy important it is to wear sunscreen every. single. day. This product is very moisturizing, you can totally replace your moisturizer with this and it has high SPF. It makes good primer, a good base for makeup too! This is perfect for everyone especially those who just learned to include sunscreen in their routine."
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ 50ml,"I have combination skin , this product is way too heavy to me , I‚Äôve use it for couple of weeks and try to figure it out but still , not for me . The consistency of this formula is on the thick side , and feels oily, so maybe it‚Äôs more suitable for dry skin ?"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,love it,"I love to use this as a moisturizer and sunscreen. It feels nice on the skin and isn't too sticky. I would use it when I dont want to wear any makeup, simply slather it on and would be good for the day. Would definitely repurchase again. "
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,I personally don‚Äòt like this,"I have combination skin , this product is way too heavy to me , I‚Äôve use it for couple of weeks and try to figure it out but still , not for me . The consistency of this formula is on the thick side , so maybe it‚Äôs more suitable for dry skin ?"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Effective as moisturizer,"Saw the good reviews so I bought this because of the multi-usage of both sun-screening and moisturizing purpose, especially for humid weathers and harmful UV rays in sg. I was not used to the smell of it at first."
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Dual Purpose Moisturiser,"I love the convenience of having two products in one so you do not have to pile stuff on your face just to be protected! The coverage is good and it is not too oily but comfortable despite my combination skin. Hassle-free, saves time and money."
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Lifesaver ,"To be honest, i dont really like to wear sunblocks because of the sticky texture. BUTTT Alpha H is really good like it is very light on my face. And also it comes as moisturizer & sunblock. How i wish this product is available in stores :-("
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Great texture ,"Great texture absorbs quickly but might be too rich for oily skin. Overpowering smell of sunblock that doesnt seem to go away unless you put makeup one. Seems waterproof to a slight extend. When I splash my face with water, I can feel a slight film over my skin"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,So moisturizing,"I super duper love this ALPHA H moisturizer. Not only does it moisturise your skin, it also has SP 50 which protects your skin from the harmful rays of mr. sun! I use it with my ALPHA H liquid gold toner and it works perfectly for me. SO MUCH LOVE FOR ALPHA H PRODUCTS!!! Can't wait to try the others!!!"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Good product!,"I have been using this moisturiser+sunblock for almost two years now, and I love the convenience of having two products in one! The coverage is good and it is not too oily despite my combination skin. Will continue to purchase!"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Broke me out,"This broke me out. I have sensitive skin easily prone to breakouts and this was no exception even though I love Alpha-H and use their face wash and liquid gold. It might be the sunscreen part of it, or it might be the lotion that's too heavy. In any case, it didn't work out for me.¬†

When I bought this, it was in a bottle with a pump. And the pump broke."
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,very good sunscreen,"a 2 in 1 combination which has both moisturiser and sunscreen, its great for people who wants to save both time and money ! applies smoothly and doesn't feel greasy too . highly recommended for those who wants to save time !"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Another great product from Alpha H,"I really like this sunscreen for daily use as it's not greasy and absorbs onto the skin very easily and not heavy on the skin. But you need to reapply if you are exposed to the sun for a long time. ¬†
There is no break out on my face after using this for a few weeks which i am very happy about. ¬†
I will consider repurchasing this when Luxola offers discounts!¬†"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,have not tried,"have not tried¬†

but i am liking the brand so far.

first time trying and it has not broke me out with my sensitive skin

tried the micro cleanse and liquid gold liked it.
have not followed up with this as i have an existing moisturiser to finish"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Good!üëç,I purchased this product for the second time coz it is really good. It is not greasy and sticky. Good protection for skin which is important for my daily use under a hot climate with it's SPF50+ UVA/UVB. Recommended and will purchase again.
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,a,"A great non-greasy sun screen with SPF 50.

I have not experienced any clogged pores/breakout since using.

Anyone with oily/combination skin should own this, the best sun scree i have ever used.

I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for sun screen with high SPF protection and not risking clogged pores."
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Great,"Good, fuss-free moisturiser with SPF 50++ . Light and easy for me to incorporate in to my morning skincare regime. Replace my BB cream with this on most days to let my skin breathe and its been working well for me ! A+++"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,just ok,"I am a big fan of the Alpha-H cleanser and Liquid Gold products, so when I saw they have a moisturiser with SPF, I thought to give it a try. As my sunblock, I feel this product is still a bit thick for my preference, such that I can feel as if my face is sweating heavily, as I go out for work in the morning."
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,I love it! ,This moisturizer is quite light on the skin and doesn't make my skin oily throughout the day. However i think it's not quite moisturizing enough so sometimes when my skin is slightly dryer I will use another moisturizer underneath this. I don't think this is too pricey and would totally repurchase when I ran out. 
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Light and effective,"This is a great moisturizer for me, my skin tends to be oily and doesn't match well with products containing sunscreen very often. My tube says it 50+ SPF so maybe it has changed slightly over time. It's great for me though. Used alone my skin feels smooth, moisturized, but not oily by the end of the day. It would be fabulous to finally have a maximum protection moisturizer that doesn't feel greasy and suffocating by days end."
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,love it,"i love this¬†product. doesn't make face oily and no white cast. Face feel smooth after application. After few hours oily did come but I will just blot it away n put some powder on or if I still got activities under the sun, I will just re-apply it."
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Thick,Decided to get this moisturiser with SPF when I was searching for a sunblock. The texture is too creamy for me and the humid weather.. It made me feel oily and caused my skin to breakout mildly. I think it is effectively moisturising though.
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,POOR,"Bought it because it has good reviews on Luxola but was rather disappointed with it. First the bottle pump was faulty and I had to request for a replacement. Second the product smells strongly of sunscreen although it's only a SPF30. Third, although its very creamy it comes off as too oily and will make my face SHINE (eww). Fourth it doesn't take much blending for the product to start forming white balls around the entire face which makes it pretty unpleasant. Had to throw it away. Rather use a banana boat.¬†"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,alpha_H,"its light coverage and good spf as sunblock
but its too oily for me...i have combination skin
Think it cause breakout in the end after 1 wk apply...stop using it already...may try it again if days with a lot sun explosure..."
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,"Great moisturiser for my oily skin, a HG!","I first purchased the Luxola Exclusive Kit with all the travel-sized minis and this moisturiser was bundled among them. My skin really liked it; firstly it didn't break me out and secondly it protected my skin well against harmful sun rays (I brought it with me to an OCIP trip to Philippines and wore it everyday for 2 weeks under the merciless sun there -- I got no sunburns AT ALL! Another plus point: my skin is acne-prone and was looking pretty clear throughout as well.) Since my skin is loving it I decided to purchase the full-sized product as standby in case the smaller one runs out :-) No harm, anyway! Thank you Luxola for carrying such an awesome product!!!"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Excellent!,I love this moisturizer. The best thing is that it has SPF30 and its also not too sticky. Just perfect to be worn under liquid foundation or your face powder. I've purchased the sample size tube before i get the bigger bottle. I highly recommend this moisturizer. 
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Great SPF moisturizer ,"Love this product, doesn't make face oily and no white cast.
Face feel smooth after application.
After few hours oily did come but I will just blot it away n put some powder on or if I still got activities under the sun, I will just re-apply it."
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Great little moisturizer!,I'm in love with all alpha h products. I think maybe a little too much. But if I ¬†find something that works I tend to go all out. I like this moisturizer. A little goes a long way as its quite thick. It doesn't leave a white film and it feels so beautiful on. After my serum I put a little on and faff around the house before I put on my tinted bb cream and leave the house! I'm on my second bottle already!!!
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Good basic SPF moisturiser,"Bought this after deciding to be better about using SPF on a daily basis. This product was recommended by Caroline Hirons on her skincare blog so I decided to try it. Its a bit heavier than I am used to using on my combination skin, but does not break me out. You just need to wait a few minutes for it to sink in before putting your makeup on. It doesn't really promise to do much other than ¬†provide moisture and sun protection and it does the job. Doesn't keep oil at bay for longer than normal for me, but at the same time it doesn't make me feel greasier than usuall. Great all round moisturiser. If you want more skincare benefits, you can just address those needs with a serum before using this.¬†"
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Very Good Moisturizer,The concentrate is quite thick so you know you are getting a good coverage in terms of getting skin nourishment and protection from the sun. I would not recommend this for those with oily / combination skin and I noticed your make up will melt / slide off faster but I suppose it's because of the sun protection factor in the product. Best to wear it alone.The smell is of any sun protection cream. I would buy this again although it's a bit pricey since it seems to be doing good for the skin.
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Perfect,"Not too sticky, just the right amount of SPF and surprisingly moisturizing. Goes right under makeup fine. It's easy to spread but not watery and the pump makes it easy to control the amount of product dispensed.

Would wish it was cheaper but that's what sales are for."
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,nothing fanciful,"I find this just a normal sunscreen moisturer. Nothing spectacular to rave about. Texture is generally good, not too oily or watery. Easy to use one application moisturer with adequate sunscreen coverage. The other Alpha-H liquid gold products are more interesting. "
ALPHA-H-Daily Essential Moisturiser SPF 50+ with Vitamin E,,Thumbs up!,"Good daily moisturiser with high spf that isn't greasy, doesn't leave a white sheen and a good base for makeup! And the packaging is super sleek and sits nicely on my dressing table! ;) ¬†Loving alpha h at the moment! Thanks Luxola for getting such amazing brands in!¬†"

DIOR-Diorsnow Ultimate UV Shield Skin-Breathable Brightening Emulsion SPF50+ PA++++,Malaysia, Not as what I expected,It was my first purchase. The texture is watery & white. I wore it everyday and finished it for the sake of not wasting it. It wasn‚Äôt my favourite - I don‚Äôt like or hate it. But it was worth a try.
DIOR-Diorsnow Ultimate UV Shield Skin-Breathable Brightening Emulsion SPF50+ PA++++,Singapore,"Pricey, but good!","I love this. It's very pricey, but it works well. It smells great and doesn't leave a white cast or make my make up slip and slide. I'd get this again if there was a sale."
DIOR-Diorsnow Ultimate UV Shield Skin-Breathable Brightening Emulsion SPF50+ PA++++,Malaysia,Convenient,"I bought it during sale!! Price VS Size is on the high side. If you sweat alot, best to stay away from this product. Easy to carry around and re apply every now and then. "
DIOR-Diorsnow Ultimate UV Shield Skin-Breathable Brightening Emulsion SPF50+ PA++++,Singapore,Ms,"I found it make my face look oily, not what I expected if compare with the price that I paid for it. I willing to pay higher but dun look oily, feel disappointed, and I just put aside right now. Wasted. "
DIOR-Diorsnow Ultimate UV Shield Skin-Breathable Brightening Emulsion SPF50+ PA++++,Malaysia,not sticky on the face! ,Love that it doesn‚Äôt leave a sticky feeling on the face. But i need to touch it up with powder to prevent extra ‚Äòglow‚Äô on the skin. Would repeat if the wallet permits since it is quite pricey. 
DIOR-Diorsnow Ultimate UV Shield Skin-Breathable Brightening Emulsion SPF50+ PA++++,Singapore,Not too bad ,Love the consistency of the emulsion. Not oily but feels a bit sticky on the skin (product probably stays on skin). I‚Äôve applied on my face and a bit in the neck. Pretty ok!
DIOR-Diorsnow Ultimate UV Shield Skin-Breathable Brightening Emulsion SPF50+ PA++++,Singapore,One of my favourite sunblock,Its a light sunblock that gives very good coverage. My facial lady can tell where I stop putting sunblock on my neck. She reminded me to apply all the way to the back cos can see a difference in tone! Its give shine which I dun really like so I use a tissue to blot it away. Although shiny but its not oily for my combination skin.

ULTRA VIOLETTE-Extreme Screen Hydrating Body & Hand Skinscreen SPF 50+,Singapore,Good product but odd packaging,It is lightweight and non sticky. Takes a short while to be absorbed but provides good spf coverage. Only gripe is the design of the twist open bottom where it is almost impossible to prevent transfer of sunscreen as there is no cap to cover the opening.
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Extreme Screen Hydrating Body & Hand Skinscreen SPF 50+,Philippines,super good body SPF!,I like how this isn‚Äôt so sticky. Most body sunscreens that I have tend to pill or stick badly on my skin and I hate that feeling. This one didn‚Äôt and it‚Äôs so good if you‚Äôre out walking in the city especially in a tropical country. It‚Äôs definitely worth it 
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Extreme Screen Hydrating Body & Hand Skinscreen SPF 50+,Singapore,micro glitters,Why do you need glitter in sunscreen?? Why is that even necessary??? This would haven been perfect if not for glitter! Hopefully they create another version of this WITHOUT the microglitters. 
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Extreme Screen Hydrating Body & Hand Skinscreen SPF 50+,Singapore,A great SPF for outdoors ,"I simply can‚Äôt fault this sunscreen because it delivers on its promise. No burns with this on outdoors, sans UV protective clothing. I would also encourage thorough reapplication every 2 hours. Overall, this is an absolute winner."
ULTRA VIOLETTE-Extreme Screen Hydrating Body & Hand Skinscreen SPF 50+,Singapore,happyy,It is so easy to use and this is my 2nd purchase plus many more to go üòÑThankyou Sephora for  this amazing ultra violet Ye cream it works perfectly  so happy with this cream
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Tone Up Milk SPF50 PA++++,Malaysia,Okay,Bought this for my mum. My mum likes the smell. I have tried this for few times too but it made my face looks kinda oily. It does tone up skin tone but I would say it‚Äôs almost no coverage at all. Not sure if I will repurchase this :)
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Tone Up Milk SPF50 PA++++,Malaysia,nice,"nice product, tone up milk spf50 pa++++, suitable for me, can apply everyday after toner, feeling good and bright, milky skin, love it so muchhhhhh, buy it "
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Tone Up Milk SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,Good,"No complain for my friend, bought it for her. Seems good and no complains of breakout"
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Tone Up Milk SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,great product ,This is my multiple repeated purchased. Item is on the pricier side but a little goes a really really long way. I love the texture of this and how easy it is to glide on. Thumbs up for this product!!
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Tone Up Milk SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,Light Sun Block,This sunblock is light and milky. It absorbs into the skin quietly. The coverage is good too. It also blends well with ice cream. Highly recommended to skins. Good to try it!!
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Tone Up Milk SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,I love this product! ,"I own both the aqua gel and this sunblock and I have to say I love both! This one comes with slight tint so if I want to look like I have some colour on , I‚Äôll use this product. Smells good and luxurious. Face looks plump after applying too. I really like it. "
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Tone Up Milk SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,Student,I bought this because I saw Twice' MUA use this for Sana's base. I don't regret purchasing this. I like this better when I mix with foundation than apply by itself.
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Tone Up Milk SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,Hello shimmering youthful skin! Goodbye sunspots!,"I love this product! I‚Äôm on my 4th tube.  Keeps my sunspots at bay. I‚Äôm in my 40s, with dry skin.  This product protects my skin from the sun, whilst also leaving a shimmering healthy glow.  I rarely leave a review, but I have to rave about this product, because it is great!

My previous fave sunscreen was by SK2 SPF50 Whitening sun screen, but this was discontinued several years ago.  Since then, I‚Äôve tried multiple brands (Eucerin, Dior, Chanel, BioEssence), but none gave me a bright healthy glow and prevented/reduced sunspots.  Thank goodness I finally found a worthy replacement - this product.  

My search is over, this is my holy grail for facial sunscreen.  I only need to use a tiny bit of CC Cream to provide light coverage on a few stubborn blemishes, otherwise this sunscreen does a great job for the rest of my face.

I agree with the other reviewer that this suncreen leaves an oily sheen. If you prefer a less shimmering finish, a light dusting with a large powder brush of loose face powder (I use Terry - Hyalauronic Hydra Powder) leaves a flawless finish and removes the oily sheen."
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Tone Up Milk SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,underwhelming,"Beautiful packaging that‚Äôs befitting of Lanc√¥me. However quite disappointing this is the exact kind of expensive sunblock you wish it didn‚Äôt have all the bad results - doesn‚Äôt sit well under makeup, make you look like an oil slick shortly after and throughout the day. The pearly white tone up milk did as it claims - gives your face pearly glow (micro shimmers) and does leaves a white cast as it‚Äôs supposed to brighten the tone of your skin and give the false impression of radiance. "
SKIN INC-Pure UV Protect‚Å∫ Face Cream SPF30 PA++,Singapore,Not for me,It makes my skin dry and leaves a very bad cast (almost like gray). For this price waste of money for me. 
EVERYDAY HUMANS-Oh My Bod! SPF50 Body Sunscreen,Singapore,Able to restock?,Really like this physical sunscreen but I can‚Äôt seem to find it online or in-store anymore. Please restock this item and I‚Äôm looking to repurchase! Does not leave a sticky residue. 
EVERYDAY HUMANS-Oh My Bod! SPF50 Body Sunscreen,Malaysia,the best,"Love this so much I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôve never heard of it when I was living in Melbourne (this brand is from Victoria!) it‚Äôs very moisturising, leaves no white cast, feels like lotion, great sun protection, easy to apply because of its consistency, and my favourite part since I‚Äôm living in a hot and humid country now is that it‚Äôs sweat resistant for up to 50minutes(?). Also water resistant:) 

Texture: smooth
Consistency: medium. Not thick not runny. Easy to apply like normal body lotion 
Effectiveness: good! No sunburns whatsoever:)
Smell: normal sunscreen smell but with a hint of cucumber scent"
EVERYDAY HUMANS-Oh My Bod! SPF50 Body Sunscreen,Malaysia,worth the money,"This a body sunscreen thats worth the money for the amount in the packaging. The scent is nice and subtle. The texture of the suncreen is sticky when applied, but it also moisturises the skin and doesnt dry it out. But from personal experience, on a hot day it feels greasy. I think its worth the try because it does it job"
EVERYDAY HUMANS-Oh My Bod! SPF50 Body Sunscreen,Malaysia,not bad,"I‚Äôve used this on several beach trips and it does the job. However for re-application purposes, it can get quite sticky for me. Hopefully there will be a lighter consistency option in the future"
EVERYDAY HUMANS-Oh My Bod! SPF50 Body Sunscreen,Singapore,Great sunscreen ,I feel like I have found the Holy Grail of sunscreens with this one. I like how this sunscreen absorbs into the skin without leaving any white cast. In addition there is no chemically smell like other sunscreens.

EVERYDAY HUMANS-Oh My Bod! SPF50 Body Sunscreen,Singapore,it‚Äôs okay,Never like sunscreen because of how weird my skin feels afterwards (like oily and sticky feeling i guess?) and this one is the same as the other sun screens i used. But not the worst I‚Äôve tried.
EVERYDAY HUMANS-Oh My Bod! SPF50 Body Sunscreen,Malaysia,SPF50,This is a great affordable option for body sunscreen. It‚Äôs not completely transparent though I‚Äôd say. Leaves a slight cast on my skin. But otherwise it‚Äôs a great product

EVERYDAY HUMANS-Oh My Bod! SPF50 Body Sunscreen,Singapore,Decent,"Leaves a bit of a weird residue on the skin even after 30 mins of application but fades away throughout the day. Smell is okay and bottle size seems ok as well, might not repurchase as i don‚Äôt like the residue"

EVERYDAY HUMANS-Oh My Bod! SPF50 Body Sunscreen,Singapore,Not bad. Would repurchase. ,"This sunscreen is not bad. It does make me feel just a touch oily if I apply it directly after moisturising (I use Belif's aqua bomb), so I do find it inconvenient having to apply this after waiting for my moisturiser to absorb. But it's still really good, doesn't leave a cast and it feels very natural on the skin."

TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,Primer ‚úñÔ∏è  ‚Äî  SPF ‚úîÔ∏è,"I bought this coz of the reviews and that a primer with SPF 50 sounds great. I really want to like this but I dont feel the ‚Äúsmoothing the skin for effortless make up application‚Äù. It‚Äôs disappointing but I still use it over my moistuizer for the UV protection. Then I apply my primer. After not being happy with this, I bought Lancome‚Äôs LA Base Pro. Now that‚Äôs what smoothing make up application really is. I still give it a 3 coz it‚Äôs secondary selling point for me, the SPF, is very good and it is really light-weight on the skin."
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,a Must,"TF sunscreen is the closest to makeup quality I‚Äôve found yet , aside from Sisley. I have several clients who hate the feel of sunscreen under their makeup yet never even notice when I Use This TF screen. Excellent protection with a veil like feel."
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,The One!,"I cannot rave enough about this moisturizer from Tom Ford. It the holy grail for me, after years of searching for the right combination of excellent moisturizing, high SPF, and something that won‚Äôt clog my pores. I used to have oily to combination skin but as I‚Äôve aged through my 40‚Äôs I now have dry skin and despite exhaustive efforts to the contrary I still breakout occasionally. This TF moisturizer checks all my boxes plus it feels so amazing as it goes on and leaves my skin feeling softer than ever. Yes, the cost is high, but after searching as long as I did, the price is a drop in the bucket compared with all I‚Äôve spent on products that didn‚Äôt work. Trust me, when you find ‚Äòthe one‚Äô you know it and it is worth the extra $$."
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,Not worth the $$$,"For the price, nothing special 
Using a Korean brand spf 50 for less than half the cost and it works beautifully. Just trying to find something lighter for our hot summers."
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,Expensive but works,I love that you can use this as a primer and that it has SPF in it. Thankfully it did not provide a white cast and helped my makeup last for more than 8 hours.
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,Tom Ford Beauty Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,It is Tom ford and the quality is present. It is perfect for my dry sensitive skin. It leaves you as if you have applied a highlighter-just dewy and glowing. I wear it on weekends with no other makeup. The bottle is very small but the quality compensates for the quantity.
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,Best Under-Makeup Sunscreen,"Just repurchased. It is an all time fav. for me. Honestly, I wanted a great sunscreen that protected, but didn't look bad under makeup. This did just the trick!"
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,"Really works for dry, sensitive skin","I have very dry, very sensitive skin. When look for a primer, I need one that won't dry out my skin (or--even better--adds moisture). When looking for a sunscreen, I need one that won't irritate my skin enormously or dry it out. This is the only chemical sunscreen that doesn't irritate my skin. AMAZING! And it's not brutally drying the way mineral sunscreens typically are. (The exception is the LaRoche Posay one, but that's weirdly oily and unpleasant.) For me, this product is worth the painful price. It solves the sunscreen problem while providing a gorgeous base for a tinted moisturizer or foundation. Perfection."
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,"Good product, but not necessary","I bought this because I was obsessed with Tom Ford makeup for a bit. It's a high SPF sunscreen that's also a very effective primer that improves the application and longevity of foundation. I have not tried this with a lighter foundation/tinted moisturizer to know how that combination works out. However, I don't think it is worth the high price point. One very well can buy a good sunscreen and a separate primer for the money."
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,not for oily skin,"I won't recommend this as a sunscreen, but it can be a good ""all-in-one makeup base"" for DRY skin. That's what it is for, I guess. It was very oily on my face and too light for a sunscreen."
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,Tom Ford Beauty Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,"I love this product!  To me, it is worth every penny.  I look in the mirror and I am so happy because my face looks so smooth and my makeup lasts.  The SPF is also very important to me."
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,Nice but There are Cheaper that Work Better,"Nice primer that does help my foundation go on smoother and last longer. I do have a few others that perform the same or better and are less than 1/2 the price of this one. Also, this does not control oil well."
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,doesn't feel like a sunscreen,"I have never written a product review but I want to let people know what a great product this is. I usually hate most facial sunscreens because of the smell, consistency, and tendency toward greasiness. While this doesn't smell that great, it goes on very well and actually improves the texture/appearance of my skin. In fact, I keep looking in my compact mirror because the improvement is quite noticeable. Even though it is crazy expensive I definitely recommend this product!"
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,Tom Ford Beauty Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,"This is a pretty moisturizing sunscreen that works really well under makeup. As a primer, I would say that it makes makeup look better but doesn't help it last longer. I also wouldn't recommend it for oily skin, as it made me touch oily throughout the day and I have dry skin."
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,A nice sunscreen.,"I have sensitive, combination skin. I usually wear Tatcha sunscreen under my foundation with a few drops of Tatcha's gold camellia beauty oil. I love that combination because it gives me a lit from within look while minimizing pores and keeping my T-zone matte and doubles as a makeup primer. Sadly, both Tatcha and Sephora are currently sold out of the Tatcha sunscreen and since I love all of the Tom Ford Beauty products that I own, I decided to give this a go. It doesn't break me out, a little goes a very long way (so even though the bottle isn't that big, it will last you a long time), it provides a smooth canvas for makeup application, doesn't settle into pores or fine lines, no white cast, and doesn't have any offensive fragrance. This sunscreen is moisturizing and is a great base for makeup application. I love using it under the TF traceless Foundation stick. It gives a slightly dewy finish, so I do powder my t-zone after makeup application and it lasts all day. I occasionally spray my cheeks with 1-2 sprays of the Tatcha luminous dewy skin mist to give my cheeks a little extra lumination. If you have normal to dry skin, you could totally spritz it on your whole face, but an expert from Tatcha was gracious enough to teach me how to apply their luminous dewy skin mist for an afternoon pick me up, for those of us with combination to oily skin. If you had an extremely long day of makeup wear ahead, I would recommend applying a primer over this sunscreen. But for me, my makeup lasts longer than usual (without a touch up), using this sunscreen as a base for my makeup. This sunscreen works well for those with sensitive skin, normal, and combination skin. Those with oily skin could pull this off with a mattifying primer applied over the areas get extra oily throughout the day. And while this sunscreen is moisturizing, those with really dry skin will want to make sure to properly moisturize dry patches prior to applying this sunscreen. I am personally 100% satisfied with this sunscreen as an alternative to my HG Tatcha sunscreen. I will keep this sunscreen on hand from now on because it is challenging for me to find a sunscreen that lives up to my skin's needs. If you are on the fence about this sunscreen, get a sample of it from your local Sephora or Tom  Ford Beauty counter, you won't be disappointed and all skin types can find a way to make this sunscreen work well with or without makeup. I can say that for very few of the dozens that I have tried."
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,The best yet,"I am a very fair skinned redhead and I live in the desert. Sunscreen is just not optional for me, it's a must. I constantly search out and try new products in the hope of finding ""the one"".  This is it.  I've been using Tatcha for quite a while which I thought was as close to perfect as sunscreen could get. It doesn't hold a candle to this. This applies and melts into the skin like skincare.  How they did this, I don't know.  Don't care either, as long as TF keeps making it.  It also works very well as a primer. No pilling, no sliding, just lays down a really smooth base.  Yes, it is awfully expensive for 1 oz. I'm ordering multiples, that's how good it is."
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,Um... OMG.,"Not sure what is in this stuff but this... this is freaking AMAZING. For some reason I thought this was mostly SPF with a side-function of some primer capabilities. But no joke this is an amazing PRIMER. Easily blows all my other primers out of the water - I cant think off the top of my head something that is comparable. I just put it on today and my makeup looks... flawless. And I didnt even use a BeautyBlender today!! I want to keep looking in the mirror because I cant believe what I see. I would never describe my makeup as being flawless in general because of certain areas where I have noticeable texture on my skin. It can make application of certain products more difficult than it needs to be, but with this my skin looks SO SMOOTH, and my makeup application looks like I got it done by a pro - that flawless, polished feel of skin-loving makeup. I feel like this would be a great base for wedding makeup. It works hard and feels like nothing on the skin. It doesnt have a silicone feel like most primers, it actually feels more like a lightweight moisturizer and absorbs quickly. No greasy afterfeel on fingers either. Easiest application primer - no need to concentrate on certain areas, or deal with pilling particles. One and done - which is extra points in my book.

The obvious cons of this is the price, and you will find the size of the tube is really small(enough to fit in your hand), but yowza, I cant say that I have a desire to go back to $20-$30 primer after this. Mind blown. Cant believe Im saying this, but hopefully this is not limited edition."
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,beautiful,this is the best primer yet. a little pricey...but worth every penny. It goes on beautifully and gives my face a glow. Protects my skin is a plus! love this.
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,The Bomb!,"My foundation sticks well to this and looks glowy, beachy and pretty. It looks like I eat healthy and exercise which I have been neglecting. It really looks like I spent time at a health spa or took a trip to ""healing waters!"" I love the look I get with my RCMA foundation and NARS creamy concealer!!! Thanks Tom for my present HG primer! And spf!"
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,It is too oily for me,"I live in Texas so you already know that humidity is a problem. I bought this product because of the couple of reviews I read that made the product sound amazing. However, it did not work for me. I am currently using Sunday Riley for my problem with acne. When I put this on my skin feels good but it looks like I am sweating. I have tried to wait at least half an hour between applying my Sunday Riley product and this. I have also waited half hour before putting my makeup on so that this product settles. Either way, my skin looks oily. I don't have oily skin and my acne was caused because of stress so I know it is not my skin that is the problem. I wanted to love this but it fell flat."
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,Great Priming Sunscreen,Love to use this as a primer and sunscreen. It does not have an oily consistency nor does it leave a white residue. It's not your typical sunscreen!
TOM FORD BEAUTY-Face Protect Primer SPF 50/ PA ++++,USA,wow!,"Okay I know this is very expensive. But I have tried everything from Shiseido to Tatcha to Chanel, and I've officially found my holy grail sunscreen. It leaves a beautiful glow to your skin, without any grease or shimmer. Meanwhile, it also sits perfectly under makeup. In fact, my makeup looked a lot better. I received so many compliments on my skin since I've started using this. And no, this isn't just like any glowy primer. I've used everything from becca to Laura mercier to Armani for glowy primers. This just smoothes and blurs the skin while providing high protection. I sincerely hope this isn't limited."

SK-II-Atmosphere Airy Light UV Cream SPF 50+ PA++++,Singapore,not exactly special ,"Product is light and easy to apply, blendability is quite good as well with no Cakey feeling. but don‚Äôt feel like its effects are particularly wow for its price! Probably not going to repurchase"
SK-II-Atmosphere Airy Light UV Cream SPF 50+ PA++++,Malaysia,it's nice,"I have been searching for perfect sunscreen like forever. I don't really like that oily texture but this one is tolerable. It's not too oily, absorbs easily. Since the weather here is hot and high humidity so wearing sunscreen is a must. I think I'm gonna stick with this one!"
SK-II-Atmosphere Airy Light UV Cream SPF 50+ PA++++,Malaysia,so far happy,"Generally a good product. Not greasy and won‚Äôt leave a white cast on my face. I was slightly disappointed that I bough this in Feb 22 but the manufacturing date is back in 2020. Sephora could do better than this.

LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Complete SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,good ,"Try to this product, It is good but not fully coverage for me. Like it because of SPF and hydration. Easy way is cushion that is preferable, save time . Price is valuable. "
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Complete SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,Medium coverage with good UV protection,"Been using this product since their previous version that had discontinued. Product is not as spreadable compared to the previous version, but still good. Medium coverage with high UV protection which I need when I‚Äôm out and about.

really a great product and suitable for sensitive skin! "
LANC√îME-UV Expert Youth-Shield‚Ñ¢ Complete SPF50 PA++++,Singapore,Good,"A product with 2 functions: Good coverage and is able to protect your skin from the sun. The texture is not greasy, and breathable for the skin. Smell nice too. "
SHISEIDO-Clear Suncare Stick SPF 50+ PA++++,Singapore,Greasy ,"Not a fan of that orangey scent. This also leaves my skin feeling tacky and looking greasy. Bought this cos kept seeing this on TikTok, totally not worth the hype and waste of money. "
SHISEIDO-Clear Suncare Stick SPF 50+ PA++++,Singapore,compact and works well,"There is a faint scent for this sun screen stick that I can‚Äôt quite pinpoint what it is close to but I like it. The stick glides well and if applied on top of make-up, there is a bit of transfer but i don‚Äôt really mind it."
SHISEIDO-Clear Suncare Stick SPF 50+ PA++++,Singapore,Awesome,Can be a bit greasy looking if you have oily skin but can use your fingers to further spread into skin althought that defeats the purpose of it. Quite waterproof and defination sweatproof. Lasts a really long time even with reapplication everyday
SHISEIDO-Clear Suncare Stick SPF 50+ PA++++,Singapore,my first sunstick & I'm beyond impressed!,"I wear makeup when I'm outside usually so I've always been looking for a way to re-apply sunscreen over my makeup without lifting. This is my first sunstick ever as I primarily use liquid sunscreen and I have to say that I'm very impressed! Doesn't feel greasy, absorbs so fast. very compact and convenient to bring in your purse.  I have experienced no lifting even over foundation! Only thing is that it does sell out fast and it is hard to find in stock."
SHISEIDO-Clear Suncare Stick SPF 50+ PA++++,Singapore,Not bad,Easy to apply because of the stick design. It does felt a bit sticky after apply. But it is much better after some time. It is convenient to bring around.
SHISEIDO-Clear Suncare Stick SPF 50+ PA++++,Singapore,my fav sunscreen ,"So quick and easy to apply, this is my fav sunscreen. Completely mess free and a daily staple. I have dry skin and this feels like a dry oil type of texture. "
SHISEIDO-Clear Suncare Stick SPF 50+ PA++++,Malaysia,love,Love how easy to apply this. Especially for reapplication on-the-go and for water sports activity. The only drawback is the avobenzone in the ingredients that degrades when used with mineral sunscreens (read this somewhere). So can‚Äôt use this for layering mineral sunscreens
SHISEIDO-Clear Suncare Stick SPF 50+ PA++++,Singapore,Sunscreen,I was eyeing on this product for a much longer time. I made use of the sale at Sephora this time. This product is very very good for skin as much as I heard. My all time fav sunscreen recently. 
SHISEIDO-Clear Suncare Stick SPF 50+ PA++++,Malaysia,Stick suncare,Had so many expectations from this suncare but omg the worst one.This is not for oily skin.Please note this stick is oily and leaves your skin looking horribly shiny.Will go back to my supergoop suncare which is way better than this.
SHISEIDO-Clear Suncare Stick SPF 50+ PA++++,Singapore,Mrs. ,"Super sun screen!!!! Compare with liquid products , this one is very Easy to apply and easy to wash off.  I am really happy either the excellent results. 
pleasant shopping experience. "
SHISEIDO-Clear Suncare Stick SPF 50+ PA++++,Singapore,Ms. ,"Easy to apply, good coverage and excellent protection. Handy pocket size for carrying with me. Really like that I can reapply during the day - even over make up."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,"oily, white cast","This is a mineral sunscreen with umber sheer technology but it is equivalent to every other mineral sunscreens. It has a white cast and also leaves clumps of white pigment when spreading out. It looks dewy and oily. If you‚Äôre out in the sun, this product makes it greasier than it already is."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,produces white cast and white bits,Very expensive and disappointing with the results! The texture is the worst when i applied on my face it immediately produces white cast and little white spots and bits on my face. I tried to even it out but it just got worst! I regretted when i read there were reviewers who experienced this! Should‚Äôve trusted them!!!
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,Leaves a white cast ,So I‚Äôve been using this for about 2 years. It leaves a white cast which is not good when you have brown skin. However since I‚Äôm working from home I don‚Äôt mind. I use a different sunscreen when I go out. The main reason I buy this is that it is a mineral sunscreen. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Singapore,Drunk Elephant - Umbra Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF30 ,"Drunk Elephant - Umbra Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF30. NOT
everyone gonna like this! Leaves you an obvious white cast if you are more to darker tone. Smells chemically strong & don‚Äôt apply near to your eyes area it stings like hell. Disappointing that Sephora always sells product at much higher price then other retailers. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Singapore,Not for me,So far this is the least product that I like from DE. I didn‚Äôt like how it looks on my skin. Leaving a white film that doesn‚Äôt look nice on my face. I gave it to my mum instead. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Singapore,Good Sunscreen ,This is the first time I‚Äôm trying out Drunk Elephant sunscreen. The texture of the sunscreen is easy to spread and won‚Äôt leave a white film on my skin. I feel it‚Äôs quite lightweight and doesn‚Äôt feel oily. I believe I will be using it for quite sometime until I find another better one. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,WHITE CAST,bought as suggested by the beauty advisor and honestly this product is not for me. it has white cast that made me look like robert pattinson in twilight üíÄ such a waste buying this as i am not using it at all after first try
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,Good sunscreen ,"Leaves a light white cast, very sticky for atleast 1 hour and super minty which i hate. butttt its protection is top notch. tested it and it works so well"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Singapore,not for me ,"Heard so many reviews from top beauty gurus and skin care gurus, decided to give it a try. Sadly, it's not for me. First opened the bottle and noticed a sandy clumpy texture to the product - already weirded out by this. Not sure if it's because of the humidity, but upon application it leaves white clumps, and a visible white cast on my pale skin. (I'm only using one peasized drop which is not even a sufficient amount.) Worst of all - IT STINGS MY SKIN! After 10 mins of application, I can feel a weird tacky plastic feeling film on my face. When I perspire, it forms a milky white residue. Really disappointed with this.

Would give it a 0 star if I could. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,every sun day,"full five stars for this one. i absolutely love this sunscreen. been a fan since two years. it takes only 1-2 mins to fully blend due to its oily nature, but leaves a healthy glow right after. the only sunscreen that doesnt irritate my eye area. very unproblematic in the terms of use and final look. however towards evening, i do feel some dryness on the skin that can be easily fixed with a moisturizer. lasts a long time to. highly suggest this"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Philippines,my holy grail or holy find of a sunscreen,I dont want to say my holy grail but yes I finally found it. I have seen mixed reviews on this drunk elephant sunscreen but want to give a chance. Im glad I did. This is the only sunscreen so far that I have tried that didnot give me any breakouts at all and it seems to help nourish my skin too ( must be the marula and all natural oils and ingredients) aside from protecting my face from the sun or bluelights. Im just inside the house most of the time. Since I am using some lactic serum I need to be sure I have sunscreen on my face. I know it is expensive but it works on my face. I barely wear makeup and if I do go out it works just like a primer on my face. I love this umbrq drunk elephant sunscreen. Worth the purchase. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,Good sunscreen,"Bought it for a friend, she loves it."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,I really wanted to like this‚Ä¶,I first heard this sunscreen from Wayne Goss and thought to myself that I need to have it as it was touted by him and some others to be the best problem free sunscreen to wear under makeup (That is mineral based). But this product stings me unlike any other sunscreen I‚Äôve tried (I have average/non-sensitive skin). On first hour of wear it was fine and it does wear well with makeup but after a while and especially at the end of the day I couldn‚Äôt handle the pain I feel on my face and had to wash everything off. Considering the hefty price tag I really do not believe this is a good product (or who knows maybe I received a faulty product). I‚Äôve also tried to make it work several times with some days being not as stingy but it stings non-theless ‚òπÔ∏è
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,Good sunscreen ,I have had zero issues with it. Sure it leaves a bit of a cast - it is mineral sunscreen afterall - but give it a few minutes and your skin really soaks it in. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Singapore,Sunscreen,"This sunscreen is a really good physical sunscreen in terms of ingredients.The really big downside is that,if you have a deeper skintone do NOT get it or at least reconsider because you dont want to look ashy like I did."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,Safe ingredients,"The ingredients are indeed safe which it is free of fragrance and bad alcohol, the price itself is also affordable as compared to other physical sunscreen. It does leave some white cast and face gets a bit oily after few hours. However, it is still a decent sunscreen for its safe ingredients and price."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Philippines,"A little thicker than what I‚Äôm used to, but my skin loved it ","I have sensitive skin and I was worried this would be too thick and look white on my face. I have brown, combination, acne-prone Asian skin, and I‚Äôm very pleased so far. My face was a bit shiny after application, but my skin absorbed it fairly quickly and it definitely felt weightless. I also liked that it was unscented as I don‚Äôt like using skincare products that have a strong scent. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Singapore,Don't enjoy using it,"The texture of the product is tacky on my skin, leaves a white cast and smell so bad. I can still smell it after 4 hours of golf game.  This is not going on my face. Don't even enjoy using it on my body, so tacky just want to wash it off right away. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,Not so bad and not so good,This sunscreen is just okay; nit so good and not too bad for me. it has the whitecast effect. the only thing i love about this sunscreen is my face do not feel oily even after few hours. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,umbra,"I'm trying a sample and so far I like this. I was specifically looking for an everyday mineral based sunscreen without silicone for my sensitive, acne-prone skin and this was recommended to me. Yes the texture feels thick and suncreen-y when applying, but it sinks in fast and I totally forget about it after a minute. My skin felt nice all day, didn't get oily, and my makeup looked good - awesome! Worth the initial distaste over the texture for me. I didn't notice any white cast or pilling."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,worth the money,"For this brand to produce such a huge quantity of sunscreen with a reasonable price is definitely a sweet calling to my expectation.  Love how it glides well across my face, doesn‚Äôt clog my pores and leave any white cast. Haven‚Äôt tried it with makeup on but hopefully it can be a good foundation for it. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,It‚Äôs a BIG MISS,"Really wanted to like this sunscreen as I‚Äôve seen a lot of recommendations. Unfortunately, it was disappointing. It has a very unpleasant smell to it and it‚Äôs very heavy on the face (I have dry skin). Also, it leaves me looking grey (I have medium brown skin tone). If you live in a humid country, it‚Äôs going make your face feel sticky and uncomfortable. A big miss for me. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,White Cast and Difficult to Blend,"Very thick texture make it super difficult to blend on skin. Even after 15 minutes apply on skin, white cast is still obvious and it become worst if you are sweating. Did not mix well with primer/foundation, and makes my makeup cakey and uneven. I felt my skin is suffocating after applying this sunscreen and dry."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,Weird ,"This doesnt leave me any white cast at all once it sets in . I squeeze it to my palm, warm it up and slowly rub the cream across my face in one direction. Not to overdo it . The white cast is quickly disappear, but it felt very heavy and oily on my skin for few minutes and longer if the weather is hot and humid. I also got very sweaty on my face once the cream is on my face. But once the cream sets in, i dont feel anything anymore except my oily skin got matte for the entire day. Yes entire day. I also wear it under bb cream. I got no more oily face . And actually feel fresh. 

It‚Äôs a weird experience with this cream but i like the overall results though the beginning of the day can be a little hard. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Philippines,My Go-To Sunscreen.,"I love this sunscreen. It gives me a dewy look and is moisturizing. It does leave a little bit of a white cast but I am not complaining since it gives a ‚Äúpowder‚Äù effect on my skin therefore, I do not need to use foundation or make-up. It also wears great under make-up."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,Good quality sunscreen,"The size is huge worth the price. The packaging is so interesting and pretty. I really appreciate it.
The colour of the product is white but not visible to skin. No residue or whitecast to skin. It leaves my skin glowy and  hydrated. No smell at all. 
My problem is with the squeeze tube packaging. Some of the product leak at the opener area and building ups. It's kind of messy and need to be cleaned regularly. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Singapore,Would not recommend,"Leaves a white sheen on your face when you use it. It does not absorb into your skin as much as it sits on top of it, making your skin oily."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Philippines,Worth it!,"When exposed to air-con for long hrs, I do recommend you wear appropriate moisturizer if you‚Äôre on the drier side like me. Consistency is watery cream and can feel sticky in the first few mins, but it dries up. The white cast at first goes away in a couple mins. Plus points for being unscented. Great sun protection worth the price tag for 90ml!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,love!,"I love this Umbra sheer physical sunscreen! Usually i use this sunscreen if i‚Äôm not planning to go anywhere, it‚Äôs good enough for indoor. Although the texture is a lil thick, but it doesn‚Äôt leave a white cast on my face. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,good sunscreen,First time trying this sunscreen..n it was not oily n not sensitive to my skin.. Applied it under my make up n so far it was ok.. The price n the volume worth buying.. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Singapore,physical sunscreen,This was the only non-tinted physical sunscreen available on Sephora and I‚Äôve never really tried other brands before so there‚Äôs no comparison. But this is rather watery and has a light white cast compared to chemical sunscreens I‚Äôve tried but I don‚Äôt really mind it. Needs blending. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,most affordable sunscreen ever !!!!,"First time purchase this product.  For the price that is selling for 90ml.......definitely a very affordable one. I guess part of the reason that is affordable is due a lower SPF. If your not out whole day i think it should be fine. 

For a person who had dry skin like me, i wont feel the product is too oily because by wearing the sunscreen whole day without re applying , at the end of the day the sunscreen would have ‚Äògone‚Äô by then. So it JUST NICE for me. 

To avoid the appearance of white residue during application on face, you may try to blend the product into your palm then apply all over the face (hope this tips help)

Overall i am pretty happy with it 
"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,LOVE LOVE LOVE,Finally found a physical sunscreen with high zinc oxide (20%) that does not leave a white cast at all. Upon first application it will give you a white cast but once you start massaging to product and spreading it evenly on your skin it blends sheerly. I use this for my face and its definitely suitable physical sunscreen for people of colour! 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,5-Star Physical Sunscreen,"For the past 5 years, I‚Äôve tried dozens of physical sunscreen imported from across the globe and this has to be one of the top for least greasy physical sunscreen, with an almost non-existent white cast (on Asian skin). So so happy to have tried this!"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,Mrs. ,Love this Sun block mainly because its physical.It also doesn't leave a white cast or oily feel. The price point is very affordable let for  90 ml package. This has been my favourite sun block the days I dont use makeup. 
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,Umbra Sheer Physical Daily Defense ,"I personally think that the price is worth it for the volume as most of the purely natural physical sunscreen is always very small! . not too oily but the texture is slight more watery than expected. I've been using it on a daily basis and so far so good, no allergic reaction etc. will recommend as the contents are fully made from natural ingredients. will buy again !"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,love,Drunk elephant is my favourite skincare product. Its such a good price for a lot of ml in this tune which can last so long. Its clear and not oily on my skin
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Singapore,Thick and heavy,"I‚Äôve been a massive fan of drunk elephant but this is a disappointing product. The texture is nice and smooths well on to skin, but that‚Äôs about where the good bits end. It feels thick, heavy and oily on the skin. Perhaps it would be good for users with dry skin.. I have combination skin. There is also a slight white cast. Would not recommend this product.. there are better sun screens in the market."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,works well,"I am a big fan of drunk elephant glycolic serum so decided to give this a try

Worth it as it comes in large tub and it isnt oily and my skin n makeup isnt affected 

Live it"
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Singapore,Ms,"Im still unsure how i feel about this. I love how it makes my skin looks. I dont wear any make up/foundation/powder and this gives me a blurring effect and my skin looks flawless & glowy. The only reason im unsure if i‚Äôll repurchase it is i find that it‚Äôs not sweat proof? I naturally sweat around my ‚Äúmustache‚Äù area and given that we must wear a mask outside, i always find the creaks of my nose & under my nostrils, the sides of my mouth & at times my chin- dry and it flakes. I have not had this issue with another brand of sunblock. Granted the rest of my face is nice & GLOWLY. I‚Äôll for sure use it till it finishes & hopefully by then, work out a cocktail that works for me so that i can repurchase. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Singapore,not poc friendly ,"to my fellow melanin rich sisters out there. this product is sadly not for us. it‚Äôs so so hard to find a good mineral sunscreen with no white cast but sadly this product has about the WORST white cast i have ever seen. HOWEVER it does have a huge redeeming factor. if you‚Äôre using this under makeup, then there‚Äôs no issue at all. it‚Äôs an amazing base for makeup and it‚Äôll give you a luminous glowy beat. if you plan on wearing this on its own without makeup, i strongly do not recommend. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Singapore,Drips off,This has a prominent white cast that shows very well in your hairline and smile line. But I don't complain because the active ingredient here is zinc oxide and it is meant to be so. But if you have oily or sweaty face this is not for us. But I can work it under makeup. In a nutshell it is not so good for me as I sweat profusely
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,Non irritating ,"I love this sunscreen because it‚Äôs not irritate my skin and it also can act as moisturiser since it‚Äôs quite hydrating and moisturising. For those that experienced peeling, don‚Äôt use any silicone based products. It won‚Äôt peel after you stopped using any silicone based products. That‚Äôs just my 2 cents tips

DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,DISAPPOINTED!,"I don't know how to start this comment but if I can put in one word, I would write it as HORRIBLE. I had high hope for this product. Starting from the day I ordered it at Sephora, I just couldn't wait for it to arrive. I was very excited. Once arrived I tried it the very next day in the morning before going to work thought it would be nice and smooth and invisible unlike other mineral sunscreens. I was so wrong. It leaves noticeable white cast on my face even on my fair skin. Worse still, it starts to form tiny white clumps when I try to evenly distribute it on my skin. Why? Why the tiny white clumps?? Even when you think you managed to evenly distribute the product on your skin, up close you'll see the product somehow accumulates in each and every single pore. How do you formulate your product? Didn't you conduct testing for acceptability on your finished product before selling? Yes, I'm pointing at you Drunk Elephant formula developers. Please. Your brand's philosophy is great. I respect that. But please, make sure it's coherent with the product that you create. My search for the best sunscreen continues."
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Singapore,will not purchase again,"So if I compare this to supergoop, I feel the sunscreen is abit more thicker. It does leave a white cast if u apply too much and u got to keep rubbing it on ur face to make it disappear. It‚Äôs worth the price but I do not think I will purchase again. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,Quite good!,"It‚Äôs actually quite satisfactory and it‚Äôs easy to blend. Most importantly, it doesn‚Äôt break me out. However, it does leave a slight white cast on my face and I will need to keep blending it. I will finish this tube but I won‚Äôt consider to repurchase. "
DRUNK ELEPHANT-Umbra‚Ñ¢ Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30,Malaysia,Good for sensitive skin,"This is my first drunk elephant product, and i am amazed with it. Its good for my sensitive skin and doesn't leave any residue. Definitely will repurchase."
