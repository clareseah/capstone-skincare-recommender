FRESH-Skincare Prep Essentials (Christmas Limited Edition),Australia,feels nice!!!,Well I love the rose fragrance in it. Toner feels great on my skin. And simple rose water might do just same. Too early to judge it’s affects though. Nothing out of the ordinary.
FRESH-Skincare Prep Essentials (Christmas Limited Edition),Singapore,fresh best-seller set ,this is really value and worth for money! the toner itself is valued at $38.00 so you basically get the soy face cleanser for free. this was really worth it since i always wanted to try their products but they were too expensive for my liking.

SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Philippines,Ms.,"I really wanted to love this product. I  partnered it with their Treatment Essence. This is expensive for a toner and I really did not see much of a difference in my skin after using this for years. I think there are better toners than this.

Acne also has a role Qingyinglu is a lotion.  Its role cannot be ignored.  Must use.  Fairy water is essence water.  Not to be used as a make-up lotion.  .  Must use the first step Lightweight dew.  Match like this.  Fairy water can play the biggest role.  #sk2qingyinglu #SK2fairy water"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,SKII-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,I have a doubt about the SKII product. I bought  SKII facial treatment essence/ clear lotion & aura essence from online. As per attached item all the manufacture date on box are different from original bar code manufacture date. And also box bar code and bottle bar code are different. I believe Sephora is selling the authentic items. Please explain to me whether authentic and/or date?
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,sk ii routine user,"I am years of sk ii clear lotion users. sk ii dont have exfoliating and clear lotion serves as toner and removes impurities after bath. 
due to ageing, skin often look dull and sk ii clear lotion is base before pitera essence. "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,ho ,This is the best lotion I have ever had it . My skin used to have acne and after I used this it removes dirt and impurities to reveal skin's true radiance. My skin glows and the face texture improved. This Lotion is formulated with Pitera and Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHA) to improve skin brightness and tone. Must try !
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,One of the best toners out there,"It’s so painful to write this review.. Ok here’s the deal. Does SK2 work? Yes 100% it works for me. However the price is just so.. ugh! The furthest i’ve gone with SK2 is the cleanser > clear lotion > treatment essence. And that routine made my skin crystal clear and dewy.

I did notice however that after awhile using this, my face would hit a plateau and it wouldnt deliver exceptional results. More like it would stay consistent after hitting its peak. So yeah, i would recommend this but after 8mths - 10mths you might need to go back to another brand. And then pick this up after that again. "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,Repeat Purchase,Such a great product. This is already my 3rd bottle and it lasts a very long time. It cleanses my face and makes skincare easier to glide when I apply this.
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,One of my best Toner,"It’s one of my best toners.It doesn’t break out my sensitive acne prone combo skin and just take away every trace of dirt.It gently exfoliates my skin and gives glow. And also doesn’t sting.I do love this Product.
"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,Fair,I bought treatment essence one but read instruction it said good to use with clear lotion to see better results. I use this with my treatment essence after finishing one bottle I didn’t see any results just wasted money and wasted time to apply lol 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Philippines,SK II loyal customer,Removes skin impurities and keeps me pimple free.
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,best ,The best product in market as usual. I can really see the difference when I use it vs when I don’t and my skin really glows the morning after. Feels great in the skin and is one of those products that I always have. 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,good gentle toner,If you have sensitive and reactive skin. This is a good mild toner with exfoliating properties. The Pitera is hydrating and the mix of latic and other acids mildly exfoliates. 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,Best toner ever,"This product is definitely underrated. I was hooked on it ever since given a sample to try and it makes my skin so clean and clear. Use it with a piece of cotton pad and swipe it gently across your face, from in towards out and check out the amount of dirt/dead skin it manage to clear. I also use it on my neck as well. Follow with sk 2 treatment lotion or any other lotion that you prefer. I feel it preps the skin for the following skincare and yields better absorption. "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Philippines,Great toner,"I am using this with Facial Essence, it helped my skin to become clearer, brighter and healthier. SK-ii is my skin saver. I will maintain this product."
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,Rec’d old manufactured product,This is my holy grail for past ten years. However not sure if anyone should buy from Sephora. On my recent purchase i received old manufactured products from Sephora. The product was almost 2 years old. When i submit complain i was told by staff that it has 3 years shelf life so i can still use it. Excuse me who is happy to pay full price for a near expiry product? Tho i bought during sale but does it mean i shud accept an old product? Still liaising over this with Sephora & hope they can provide a reasonable solution soon. What a hassle! 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,Ms,I have been an avid SK ii supporter for the past 20 over years. I have recently added this toner in before the SK II essence for the past few years as I needed some extra care due to the age factor. It really does helps the skin to be more moist and subtle. It does give me extra boost after adding this into my skin care routine
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Australia,Skin care staple,"I have been using this lotion for year now, I use it after washing my face and it cleans the makeup residual very well, and doesn’t leave unpleasant feel after. Plus it doesn’t have any fragrance to it which is another plus for me."
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,SKII TONER,Love it sooo much!this lotion remove all dirt from my face.so satiesfied when i see all dirt on the face cotton. Will buy it again!love love love love! Love it sooo much!this lotion remove all dirt from my face.so satiesfied when i see all dirt on the face cotton. Will buy it again!love love love love!
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Australia,Hydrating,"This product was hydrating and nice, but considering the price tag it was nothing special and nothing that a product for half the price couldn’t do. Was expecting more from the product considering it’s a high end brand"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Australia,Nice toner,"Ounce for ounce, this is one of the more value-for-money products from SK-II. In fact, its formulation is similar to its Facial Treatment Essence (including a high concentration of SK-II’s star ingredient Pitera), which costs a lot more. "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,GLOWY SKIN,I have been using this for more than a year now! It works well with the essence and sure gives you the glow on any day! will definitely purchase again!
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,I love SK 2,This works wonderfully with the SK 2 petira lotion and even the alternatives don’t work as well as SK 2. I highly recommend it.
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,Pricey but it does its job,"Am a huge fan of SK-II but I would rather you spend the money on the SK-II Treatment Essence than the clear lotion. It of course fives you twice the benefit when paired with the essence. However, purchase it if you have the funds to spare!"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,No Turning Back!,"I tried the mini version of this one, and I’m so happy with its effect that I purchase the original size! I really love SKII products because it really does wonder on my skin! It help my skin feel moisturized and plump. A ‘must’ try !"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Australia,Great ,A watery thin consistency to splash on in-between steps. It's just a little pricey. 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,sephora is horrible,I wish I can give a 0 star. not for this product but for sephora. my sk2 trearment essence was missing from my parcel and it's been a month I haven't get my refund. service is lousy. 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Australia,SK-II,this product really changed my skin. So much smoother and radiant. no more bumps on my face just scarring but that’s all g. I can see a huge difference 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Australia,Clear skin,"Help my skin to become clear. My skin is combination and sensitive, so, I recommend someone who has the same skin type as me to use this product once a day for first few weeks, after that, use twice a day. This can help the skin not too dry and it's good to use with the essence."
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,holy grail ,I have been using this product for 3 years and absolutely falling in love with this every time I use. Tried to change another brand but in the end back to SK-II again😅
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,Worth it,Absolutely love it. Dramatic skin changes seen after using a few days. Recommend using it with treatment essence. Don’t think twice. Skin looks youth and fresh. It’s worth your money. Legit!!
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Australia,Good,"Not entirely essential but I wanted this to complete my SK2 collection. It does what it’s supposed to do. Also even takes the residue make up left on your face when used with a cotton pad. 
Not a dealbreaker but nice to use with the whole set"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,REPURCHASED,"Combination skin (oily t-zone)

Have been using Clear Lotion for years paired with Facial Treatment Essence. PERFECT COMBINATION. Clear Lotion helps to remove excess dirt and oil from skin and prep skin for all the nutritions you'll putting on next. "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,worth ,The best toner ever.will make my pores look smaller.will always back to this toner.big bottle and worth the price.always use this with the essence to have better result.and make sure moistures your skin after toner and essence 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,SKII Lotion,The Best toner for me. have been using this for around 3 years and it is the best.
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,Worth the price,"I used the Sk-II facial treatment essense for crystal clear skin.
Then, I decided to use this facial treatment clear lotion together with the essense for best result.
This toner exfoliate dead skin cells and done a good job for clean and fresh look"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,Effective! ,Been using this for the longest time! It’s one of my holygrail toner for my combination + dehydrated skin! Helps to prep my skin prior to any other products topped on top of it; love the texture as well! 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,MS,Love this product. It came in good conditions. Thanks Sephora for genuine product. 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,skin care ,"SK II facial treatment clear lotion is a great product, this is my second bottle now. Helps lighten skin pigmentation and dark spot. Best partnered with their PITERA"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,SK-II toner,"After cleansing/the very first step of skin care... feeling clean and fresh after few swipes of the lotion using cotton pad, follow by the essence....Woohoo.... "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,Essential,This lasted me three months. It is part of my SK-II Skincare Ritual. I find this to be essential and it gets absorbed quickly into the skin.
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,Ms,Very nice to use…….                                                               ……..                                                                                      ……
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Australia,catch the moisture and not sticky at all ,"I love it, it’s catch the moisture and not sticky at all , since I tired the beginning set I love it and I bought it to using with the beginner set together!"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,Not Sure,"Not sure if it really works for me. I have breakouts and its getting serious this year, not sure if it is caused by the product or staying up late the entire time(staying up late did not really cause breakouts previously). The product smells abit funny.. Overall I still like the luxurious feel, but wont repurchase in short time."
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,SK II LOTIO ,Best toner/lotion I used so far leave my skin smooth and hydrated will never change to other product been using this for almost 6 weeks and didn’t make my skin purge pair with pitera just perfect with my oily skin. Reduce my acne and till night I could feel my skin less oily. 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,good toner,I like this in that it contains AHAs but is not too strong to hurt my sensitive skin. I could use it a few times a day to keep my skin clean and toned. I just ordered a second bottle.
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Philippines,Ms,Perfectly compliments use with the Pitera Essence. I have always used the essence but this is the first time I used the this toner. Love this and will definitely repurchase

SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,Good,A simple and fuss-free product. Lasts a long time too!
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,Exfoliating toner!,A really good toner! but not suitable for acne prone skin. it has AHA in it and can be too stripping for acne or sensitive skin. Best used with a cotton pad. you can see the dirt on the cotton even after you cleanse. that's a reminder for you to double cleanse!
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,very goooood,my mums purchase but this is her 4th bottle & she has amazing skin! Her current favourite combo is this + the drunk elephants night serum and her skin has been glowing!!!!!! she highly recommends this
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,Disappointed with product being opened by stranger ,"Hi Sephora, I couldn’t believe the product was being opened by stranger and all seal is broken and sticker attached with the product cap is twisted. Kindly contact me back as soon as possible."
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,toner,"skII toner i use after my cleanser apply using my hand and not with cotton pads as instructed as it irritate my skin when i use with cotton pads, first week i used i had a breakout but consecutive week no more. now use almost half of the bottle 230ml goes a long way"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,Pricy but good,I’m using this for quite sometime now. I repurchase this because I can’t find a suitable toner for my skin. This toner doesn’t break out my skin. Guess I will repurchase till I can find better toner with reasonable price.
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,SK 2 Products,"This is the only one of the product that i'm purchase for my girl which is SK2, suitable and comfortable for her and  skin is getting better every day. Well will keep purchase here , thanks "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,omg,"This is a holy grail, I used it on my hormonal pimples and it calms the flare and minimised the inflation! I've been using it constantly and I'm happy with the results, that's no wonder this brand costs an arm and a leg. "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,Toner,My skin is very sensitive and dry. I had very bad reaction few years ago and my skin cracks. I tried this with the essence and i totally see the difference. My skin though its 80% clear but I'm very happy.  It's very pricey so i stop for awhile and tried different brands but it didn't work on me. Now i use this again forever 🙂
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,Good toner with little AHA and BHA,This is good toner to invest on..everyone should at least try this toner because it just soo good because it contains bha and aha also that pitera in it..it is also applicable for sensitive skin and dry..in fact if you want to put on the essence or moisturizer you still need to have this because it will slough off the dead cells and clear pore for the next step in your routine..hence you see better result with other skincare like moisturizer or serum.. even with not skii product..soo i will say that this toner is a must..at least for me
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,New Purchase,"I've yet to try this product but have heard rave reviews, esp when used with the treatment essence. Can't wait to see the results and how long one bottle lasts! :)"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Australia,first purchased on full size,This is my first purchased on the full size. Decided to buy this after trying the small size that I bought in a set trial. I really love it. It made my skin so smooth and a bit clearer than it was before. Its a bit expensive so I waited for the sale to go on. Would definitely order again and stock up. 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,Good product,Love it! It soothes and clears my skin. Works for me. A bit on pricy side but worth the splurge.
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Philippines,Ms,"Excellent product! i've been using this face lotion for years, may face texture has improve, and never change over the years. highly recommended! to all woman had been trying to achieve beautiful youthful glow. im so glad found it😊 "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,Sk2 clear lotion ,Love this clear lotion and have been using it for years. Love how it’s lightweight and it’s the best lotion thus far . Highly recommend this product and it has been my to use make up product every single day 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,Mdm,Love this. I have used this for about 20 years. It helps to sweep the dead skin cells away and keeps my pores clean and unnoticeable. I have tried other brands but still go back to sk2 because it works for me 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,best toner,"i am truly amazed that this toner works amazing for my skin type (oily/combo). it is soothing and clears skin, can see difference after 2 weeks. worth the splurge"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,Doesn't work for me,"Unfortunately this doesn't work for me. Regretting my decision of getting 230ml instead of a smaller one, coz I paid quite a hefty price after discount.

I have fairly clear skin with close to none pores to begin, but this caused bad clogging and at half the bottle, I have too much visible blackheads with large pores and tiny oil bumps all over face. 

The only changes I made to my routine was to use this together with the skii viral treatment essence. I blame my curiosity for wanting to try out this duo even with that that much high price. Too expensive to stop using and too disappointing to continue using. "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,Neutral ,"I don’t hate nor dislike this lotion. I’ve only use half a bottle so far. For this price, I believe there are other toner out there that work better than this. It doesn’t cause my skin to breakout."
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,Always come back to this,Ive been using this for 5 years. It never fails to help clearing my skin. However. It can be a bit strong for sensitive skin. I use it every other night and it helps to reduce the bumps on my face and dead skin. 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,"2nd time trying, but failed","definitely not for my skin. first, I tried a small bottle but stopped because I had acne that time, and I stopped all my skincare. after my skin cleared up after more than year, I tried this again but still a failure of me. it's sad but definitely not for my skin type!! won't ever buy again. I gave mine to my cousin and her skin's loving it though."
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Australia,great! ,I’ve been using this along with other skii products for years and love how flawless it makes my skin. I have recommended this to many people! And would definitely repurchase again! 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,got it with the Treatment Essence ,It’s definitely very pricey for a toner type of product but I believe in SK-11 products and have been using it together with the essence and my skin has been glowy and smooth from using this. It does get the dirt out and doesn’t contain any ingredients that make my skin sting so I’m really enjoying using this !
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,Best lotion,The SK-II Clear Lotion works well to leave my skin clean and fresh
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,user for life,"I used to have acne prone and uneven skin with occasional dry patches. But after my sister recommended it for me to try, I start seeing changes in my skin within a couple of weeks using it and it gets better and better after longer term use. My skin now is in its best condition and my friends and colleagues kept asking what I use. I have been using it for almost 3 years now and can’t live without it. I even recommended for my hubby to use men’s product from SKII! Great product!"
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Malaysia,Good first try!,Really expensive for a toner but it's interesting for a first try. Not sure if I'd repurchase as the hype was all on the Pitera essence and not on this toner. Will still finish this bottle and love that it comes in a glass bottle though. 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,daily routines ,I am a fan of SK-II toner. It smooths the skin and prepare the skin for the serum and moisturiser in my skincare routine. It is expensive but worth the money. It is my 4 bottle already. 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Australia,Great Toner,SK-II Facial Treatment Clear Lotion is a final part of the cleansing routine. It contains AHA and is safe to use daily. I used it every day for my nighttime routine and my skin feels perfectly clean and fresh. A bit pricey but worth buying during sales. 
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,love it,"Skii product will never disappoint you :) worth the try.

It helps to clear the breakout which is I feel wow, amazing! I have a crystal clear skin now. I have combination dry and use tgt with the Sk ii essence. Will recommend and repurchase! "
SK-II-Facial Treatment Clear Lotion,Singapore,Love it,"This is great for my skin. Love it. After cleansing with SK2 Cleanser, my skin feels prepared for the Sk2 Clear Lotion. I poured the clear lotion onto cotton wool, and wipe down my face, especially around the T zone area. I will then use Sk2 Facial Essense before finishing off with Sk2 Radical New Age RNA Moisturizer.. "

PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,liffffee saver,"I have very oily skin, but the older I get, the more sensitive it gets. It’s difficult to deal with both issues. When glycolic acids first came out, I was all over them! The stronger the better and my skin looked great. Not anymore! After using a high percentage of glycolic, malic and lactic acid toner every night for about 3 months, my face dried out so much, but I figured using a rich moisturizer right after was enough. I was wrong. My skin had dried out so badly, that the oil, etc. became trapped in my pores and couldn’t come out! Not only did I get A LOT oilier, my face was a hideous mess, with tons of pores clogged with sebaceous filaments, tiny white dots, actually like very tiny, thin pieces of rice. Disgusting. Brought things way down. Mild cleanser, this mild Pixi toner which I love and a good night time moisturizer. My face was fortunately hidden under a mask during this awful time! It’s just now healing very well, no scarring, no acne. I guess the moral of my story is that more is not always better.."
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,ms,Amazing exfoliation that makes your face glow within weeks! The smells is good and give amazing result! I have purchase my second bottle and no doubt this is the best exofiliator
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,love,This is your sign to drop everything and just get this item! It’s a staple in my collection and has become my holy grail! Will definitely keep coming back to this.
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Australia,great!,"really good , works really well definitely recommend this product became one of my favourites for sure ! buying it again and will continue to do so when I order again next "
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,exfoliating skin  ,Actually  this toner super amazing but for my skin easy to growing pigmentation after this toner using. maybe for my skin not worth . but super brightening glow after using this within 5 days csn see this different.  
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,suitable for skin problem,Recommended for those who have acne / pigmentation skin problem. Small size but can last up to 6 months. Pakai during night time only with moisturizer. Really worth money to spend
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,idk,"I misused it for sure, using it daily two times a day. But with proper moisturiser and constant reapplication of sunblock might leave your skin better than mine. A two times per week gentle exfoliant for me is what this toner perfect for."
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,My go to toner,"This toner did not break out my sensitive skin, i used it almost every night and it made me look fresher in the morning. I tried the smaller size first and will be buying the bigger bottle soon."
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,has a fragrant,I didn’t like the fragrant in the product. I don’t see an effect big enough to encourage use of this product. It’s seems to be like any other toner in the market. I might need to find out the use of this product to make better use of it.
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,gloq tonic,"Non drying, perfect for my skin. Hardly found a toner that doesnt dry my skin but this one works so well on my skin 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻 will repurchasee again and again"
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,Perfect for my skin,"Very recommend toner, it feels so fresh and soft after applying it. The scent is not really that strong also and it is suitable for combination  skin."
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,Great!,Great product! I’ve used other products with glycolic acid and they stunk my face. This product doesn’t do that and has nice scent. Effectively removes dead skin on face. My skin feels smooth and nice the next day 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,toner ,Love to alternate this toner with other brands as I think using it daily on my skin might be a little too drying. But so far it’s been serving me quite well I would say. Just don’t use it when your skin is too sensitive like after extreme sun exposure from your beach trip. 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,loved the products ,I started using the glow tonic in 2021 and kind of hooked to it. Finishing my 5th bottle now. It has really helped me control oil and acne.I only use it at night and just love it.
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,holy grail very good,Very good product for acne oily based skin. Keep using it you will surely see pore minimize and the glow is there ! The best toner and very affordable comparing to other Sephora products!!!!!
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,Good for sensitive skin,I love that it did not give me breakouts. It was calming and pleasant to use. However I didn’t see much difference so did not continue after I finished the bottle. 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,best toner,"I just love everything about this. Gentle exfoliating. I used to have a lot of white head and now I can see a clear skin. I have already used for 3 months now. Will definitely buy again once I finish 
"
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,so so,"I love it at the beginning but then i find it too harsh on my oily-acne prone skin. Bought it only because there are so many good review on this, but not for me."
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,Amazing product,Amazing... its a great product. Must have for everyday skin routine. The first glycolic acid product that doesn’t burn my face with chemicals. i’ve already re-purchased! 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,Glow Tonic,"It’s definitely a good toner. But I’m not sure whether it gives you the glow. It does the job of a toner which is to tone the skin, remove impurities and prepare for the rest of the skincare. But definitely not something that gives you an extra glow to your face. "
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,Glowing,"I noticed that after few weeks of using this toner, it deliver the result as per what they claimed. My skin become glowing. No more dull skin. Definitely will puchase again! "
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,o,i dont eemember buying this i really hv no recollextion of seeinv this item on my vanity so mayb this item is really very underwhelming and unmemorable or i was just drunk that day i really dk so i will give it neutral rating
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,PIXI Glow Tonic,It is true to it's name. I saw the glow after a week of using. The product smells nice too and gentle on the skin. It will make you skin look and feel healthy & supple..
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,Great,I repurchased this several times as it is the best toner by far. I tried using the Pixi's retinol toner and it just doesn't work as good as this. Can see and feel visible results after using this. My favorite toner of all time.
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,Amazing,"I really loved this product, it had a mild exfoliator and not harsh on my combination to dry skin. My skin feels really smooth after using it especially on my nose area"

PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,Good exfoliating toner,"This is a good toner with affordable pricing, however I find it tends to make my skin with a bit of orangey tinge after application. Other than that it works well as a regular toner."
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,Ok,Is ok. But not sure effective. Will not repurchase. 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,PIXI Glow Tonic,Love that this exfoliates but gently as I find exfoliating products are usually too harsh. My skin foes seem brighter after using this tonic. The red ginseng is supposed to energise my skin and it does seem that my skin doesn't look as tired 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,BEST,Great alternative for your chemical exfoliater and will make your skin smoother. Definitely will purchase again. Reduce my pimples and I love to use for my armpits too. Thank you 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,best toner,"This toner contains aha bha which really helpful on exfoliating my dead skin cell even without using the physical exfoliator. I feel so fresh after apply the toner, like my dirt and impurities go away just like thattt"
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Australia,helped with pigmentations,"I have uneven skin tone. Some areas are dark especially around the mouth and eye area. It definitely brightened and evened out the skin tone. 
Any acne scars or pigmentations will brighten but it obviously won’t completely disappear. Still a good product! "
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,glow tonic,"this is my second buy. its worth it. who ever need mild peeling and dead cell to remove, you can try this. its suitable for combination, and oil skin too."
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,Great,"Bought small size just to see if it works out for me as everyone claims it gives glow. Therefore will just give review on first few application, love the smell, love the cleaning it does, doesn’t give burning sensation like other toner might. Makes your skin look fresh"

PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,Satisfied ,"Im very satisfied with this product, there nothing much i want to talk about this product, everything was great, once you try it you will understand what i mean"
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,GOAT,"by far the best toner I've used. no breakouts using this. after complacency sets in i decide to try out sometg else on the market, end up with small breakouts, then turn back to this to solve all woes. purchased multiple times over the years "
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,renewing toner,Been using this toner for years. A repeat purchase over and over again for the amazing feeling on the skin the next day after using it. Take it as a chemical exfoliate but super gentle!

PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,Holy Grail,"The GOAT. Love it so much. I sometimes apply using cotton pad or simply pat it in my skin. It reduces my scar over time. I dont mind with the smell, although some people dont like it. Will always purchase this."
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,Glow Tonic,"This product i feel is quite alright as it helps clean my skin properly after cleansing. There’s abit of the tonic smell to this toner so some people might not like it that much, i feel ok with this product but wouldn’t really purchase it again "
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,Glow Tonic,"Pixi Glow Tonic is the OG, it really brightens up my dull skin. Giving it the glow it needs. Will use it two to three times a week in order to avoid over exfoliating."
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,decent toner at a good price,"A decent toner which does its job well, and at an affordable price point. Good for oily or combination skin. Have already repurchased multiple times.     "
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,glow baby glow ,I'm into  my umpteen bottle !! I have been using this for years ...its that instant pick me up when your skin looks dull. I wish this came in spray nozzle and can be used as vaporiser!... and the product smell nice 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Philippines,Glow Tonic,"This smells nice! Really helps with clearing out remnants of make up products after washing. A little goes a long way. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you Thank you Thank you Pixi!"
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,Affordable and does its work!,"This is definitely a starter item to using AHA / Glycolic Acid toners.. before you resume to the stronger ones. As with other AHA toners, your first few usage of the toner would leave a tingling feeling or would leave your face a little red, as your skin is still new to the product. As you continue including it in your regime, you would be able to see the difference! However, I would suggest using it at night, as it does make your skin a little more sensitive to UV. Great starter item as it is super affordable!!"
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,ok toner,Works absolutely like normal toner. Very calm tor the skin. Remove excess dirt on the skin after double cleansing. Good to use daily. I have oily to combo skin works fine for me
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,Ms,My favorite item of all time. My face feels cleaned after one. No sting to the skin for me. I use it when I feel like I need to gentle exfoliate my face. 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,affordable for beauty ,can penetrate deep into the skin giving the skin a number of anti-ageing benefits as glycolic stimulate fibroblast cells deep in the dermis which then creates more collagen leading to a firmer
PIXI-Glow Tonic,New Zealand,always come back to this ,"I’ve ordered this product multiple times, it’s one of my skin care staples. Just works really well for my dry/sensitive skin and I use it every second day or so. Love it "
PIXI-Glow Tonic,New Zealand,skincare staple ,"My third order of this, it’s a must have. Keeps my skin smooth and glowy. You don’t have to use it every day either, I alternate it with another toner due to its exfoliating properties "
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,glow tonic,It brightens the skin. It works. This is my second purchase. A good mild but effective toner. I always found toners useless but this toner works in brightening.
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,great,"Been using this for about 2 months now and at half the bottle. Pretty great product for my combi dehydrated skin, though I don’t actly see any actually change. Doesn’t really brighten or anything, but does not dry up my skin while still serving it’s purpose of exfoliating. I’d say it is working pretty great since I didn’t break up and wasn’t too harsh for my sensitive skin. "
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,D,Bought this to try but am not sure if I'm sensitive to this product but it stings my face every single time I used it. Thought it would be better after a week but its not happening. 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,amazing product ,"Been trying way too many toners and this best suit my skin tone, soo glad that I decided to trust the reviews and get this instead the one from fresh. In loveeeeeee"
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,HG must buy,this is the best toner which act as chemical exfoliator. 2nd purchase and still in love with this product. just use 2-3 times per week and your white and blackhead will be reduced.
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,Ms,"my holy grail in my skincare routine. it exfoliates my skin & it gives my skin a glowy look. the most important part, my tiny bumps become lesser after using this. i can’t recommend enough because it is that good as the review claim."
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,love it.,love thr texture and smell. packaging looks great. and I like the colour of the toner also. this is my second bottle. I would recommend it! love pixi products!
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,Glow,Absolutely in love with the tonic as it is compatible with my skin. I have purchased it twice and will most definitely keep on using it. I have sensitive combination skin
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,The best product from Pixi,It’s quite strong for sensitive skin but for my normal skin this toner is very good. Just that need sometimes to do the works. My skin looks healthy and reduce the dark spots.
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,Not for me I guess! ,I didn’t feel that it did anything to my skin other than breaking me out and leaving my skin dry! May or may not work for you so yeah that’s all I have to say! 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,untuk combination oily best,dah bertahun pakai memang best toner ni . pakai malam n pagi . orang kata tak bagus pakai hari hari . tapi elok je dekat skin sebab skin jenis berminyak combination. so far takda masalah sampai hati ni pakai
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,EXCELLENT CULT FAVE,"i understand why people rave highly of this product. it hydrates my dry skin so well. my dry patches are smoother, my skin is brighter and removes the dullness. such an amazing product. did not break me out too. this is my ultimate holy grail and my best skincare purchase at sephora. even fresh’s rose water toner does not hydrate my face like this one. "
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,definitely will buy bigger size,i can see that my skin become better after few times using it.will continue using it as weekly exfoliation and make it as staple in my routine.will buy again for sure
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,favorite glow toner,"I was suggested by a friend on this toner and thought i would give it a try. The first few weeks when i start to wear it regularly, ive got compliments how my face started to glow.

I could see a difference on my skin in terms of brightening and glowing. Since then i have been usinb this product diligently for 2 years and i do not regret it."
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,okay,Not a bad product but I don’t particularly like the smell of the product. It may have a lower percentage of glycolic acid than other products but would not recommend for daily use if you have sensitive skin - once every few days is okay 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,refreshing and soothing ,This tonic is very refreshing and soothing when you apply to face.. it smells super nice too. It’s gentle enough to use on daily and glycolic acid helps to clear out my skin problems
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,gentle yet powerful,a good one if you are new into chemical exfoliant
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,Good product !,Nice and hydrating while exfoliating the skin. product is suitable for daily use. no heavy scent as well.  i have been using this product for years and I like it!
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,good toner,"a decent toner good for exfoliating. but can't really see result and felt too harsh on my skin. not comparable to lamer and tatcha texture tonic where u can see the result. of course price point is the issue here. but for those can afford it get the latter, it works better and softer for your skin. not that harsh. "
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,Song,Quite like this product. Not greasy and easy to use. Feel hydrated and some glow after using. Also love the minimalistic design of the product. Will repurchase if there’s discount. 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,Clear Smooth Skin,Item was in perfect condition and is and will always be my go to product which caters to my needs. it is highly recommended. Will use it to my fullest extent.
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,Glow Tonic - Must have,Repurchased this item so many times. It's really my go to for AHA exfoliation. Leaves my skin feeling so smooth the next day. Would recommend it to anyone looking for an exfoliation toner
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,worth to buy ,It works exactly same as it declares. It doesn't have a strong smelling which is really just my choice. I will reorder it again and again. Recommended! 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,Mrs,I’ve been using this tonic for a quite long time. Still will say its a very good tonic. So far never plan to change to other brand since this has suitable for me.
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,new HG toner for my acne prone skin,"my skin felt beautifully soft and refreshed after application, and roughness was reduced. my skin felt a little tingly and freshly exfoliated skin might feel slightly ""burned"" by the toner, but overall it's a really good toner."
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,GLOW TONIC,Been looking for a good toner and finally found this glow tonic with 5% glycolic acid and using this daily. Totally recommended this product! Cant wait to see the results 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,Nope,"Hmmmm this didn't do much difference to my skin. Tried for two weeks but nothing changed. Glow? None, I don't think so. There are better tonics out there so if you don't try this one, it's ok."
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,Great,I have been using this for couple of months now it’s a good toner.It doesn’t dry out skin nor it feels oily.Perfect for sensitive skin.Value for money.
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,love this ,I just received this product . Wanted to try this out because it is a chemical exfoliator. Wanted to see whether it will heal my millia problem . Will wait and see .
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,Not for sensitive skin,"This works but it might be a bit too harsh for sensitive skin. Personally used it halfway and gave it away because although my skin didnt have any adverse reactions, it felt like it would have had i continued using it. "
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,it's alright ,I think this product doesn't suit my face. Makes my face dry and prickly after use. My face break out after using. I won't repurchase it. Just my personal opinion 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,very small bottle ,"read through a lot of good raves on this and decided to get this and try it out. surprisingly, it arrived in a small bottle which i thought a wrong size was delivered. too expensive for the size purchase and there are better ones out there"
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Australia,glow tonic it is ,"refines pores, reduces oiliness, adds freshness, can be used throughout the day to add glow freshness to skin, really enjoyed this toner, will buy again "
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,sangat sesuai dgn kulit sy yg berminyak… bekas-bekas jerawat semakin pudar… ,Sangat sesuai dgn kulit saya yang berminyak dan berjerawat… bekas-bekas jerawat semakin pudar… jerawat pun dah berkurangan.. kulit berminyak pun tiada lagi… lepas ni nak cuba toner yang lain pula..
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,Toner,This toner doesn’t suit me. I didn’t see any changes after using it.
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,I love it,Can't remember how many times I have re-purchased this. The only toner I'm using for the past years. 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,"great, but will not repurchase","I think this toner tends to sting a bit on my face, not sure why, but I don’t think it helped my skin at all. Would not recommend this if you have sensitive skin. Think this would work if you have normal skin and your skin isn’t fussy. Else, just skip this and go for other better toners that are priced better. "
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,Pixi ,"One of the best tonic water I've ever tried, really makes your face glowing and it absorbs pretty fast I would say. Will definitely repurchase again! "
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,Best Pixi Product for me,I have sensitive acne prone skin but this product changed my skin totally. I used twice a week with overnight glow serum. Best buys I ever made. Acne are being treated and scars are fading after one bottle. Not too dry like ordinary product. My skin is getting better so I am using just once a week just to exfoliate. Always stocking up 
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Malaysia,Toner,Not working to me.. I used bit no give me effect to my skin.. So so.. No repeat to buy.. So so sorry.. And thanks you
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,repurchased,"tried it and my skin showed improvement. but wanted to cut down on costs hence got a drugstore toner but it wasn't effective, my skin condition went back to its previous state. after finishing the drugstore one (finally), I went back to sephora to buy this again. love my skin now!"
PIXI-Glow Tonic,Singapore,"Good, worth it",Exfoliates and leaves my skin looking brighter and smoother the next day. Gentle enough and won't agitate my skin. a
CAUDALIE-Beauty Elixir Bauble (Christmas Limited Edition),Australia,ok,"Ok so they hyped it on tick tock and I only got the little one just for trial I tried It but honestly I don’t see anything special about it 
It has a nice smell but I can’t figure out what I’m can do "
CAUDALIE-Beauty Elixir Bauble (Christmas Limited Edition),Australia,Beauty Elixer,"This one is a repurchase for me. I love this product, especially during summer. The product feels very lux with a fresh scent and the bottle is very cute"
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Malaysia,Hydrate,"Do what its claim, its hydrate my skin. I would like to use when i have long drive or flight, its give me refreshing feeling and good for sensitive skin"
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Malaysia,nothing much for me,"Well I am not sure about this but didn’t see any effects on my skin. But I used this if I am inside aircond room for too long, so I won’t feel dry. But not going to buy gain"
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Australia,Grape water,"I bought this during the Sephora sale and so glad I did,it makes my skin so hydrated and soft after every use, I will be purchasing more in the future, I love this product 🥰🥰🥰"
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Singapore,awesome product ,"really really love this product. the hydration it provides is 100. however, since it is a spray bottle, it is hard to know exactly where I'm applying. would be better of can make it into a non aerosol can instead. "
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Singapore,Caudalie Grape Water 75ml,"I adore this mist! It keeps me hydrated and absorbs quickly into my skin. It's not greasy or sticky at all. It emits the ideal amount of mist without attacking me. It also gives my skin a nice glow. I apply it every few hours, as well as after I apply my skincare. I never want to be without it!"
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Australia,it does the work ,It does the work but I found it a bit messy . It’s small size so it’s good to take on travels as it’s less than 100ml It does the work but I found it a bit messy . It’s small size so it’s good to take on travels as it’s less than 100ml
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Australia,so fresh,I love this it’s a very hydrating spray I use it when my skin needs some extra moisture or to freshen up. It has a very slight scent but still 5 stars
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Australia,holy grail,"Moisturising! Easy to use, love the smell. I always purchase this. Tried other brands but I always go back to this.                                                
                                                                                "
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Malaysia,FAVOURITE,"my third bottle! i tried the smaller one before and loved it so much! really moisturising, works as toner, great for dry skin! price is affordable for a caudalie product! love love love"
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Singapore,Great,"Love it! Feels great on the skin without feeling tacky!
Its nice and does keep your skin feeling hydrated as well as moisturised. You should try it. I used it as a primer and it feels wonderful! "
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Philippines,Quite a nice product,"I bought this during a bundle sale to try it out. It didn't feel like it offered intense hydration as it was marketed, but for someone with oily skin like mine, it works. It dries down quite matte & provides me with a good base for makeup application during the day. I also use it during nights when I'm too lazy to do my full skincare routine, & I wake up the next morning with skin that feels quite nice & not greasy. It does have a faint raisin-y smell that I initially found a bit off-putting, but I've gotten used to it."
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Australia,nothing special ,"eh, it's Grape water.. pretty basic and probably over priced for what it is. felt refreshing though. just not $14 worth. won't be buying again but I can see why people do "
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Malaysia,Refreshing Mist,"Clean ingredient, fresh mist, widely and evenly spray fine mist. Good for a quick fix and almost no fragrance can be detected. Gentle for my sensitive skin "
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Australia,refreshing ,"Not a superfine but a fine mist and a refreshing pick me up in the morning, in between toner and serum spray, and great to keep a small one on the fridge or car."
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Australia,50/50,I love most of their product can’t say I dislike this but I actually don’t get what it does. I think there are other products like those toner mist that are more effective and have a function. 
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,New Zealand,so refreshing!!,"finally bought this today after it being in my cart for ages, and i’m so glad i did. this is such an amazing spray and i use it after cleansing and on top of makeup to give my skin some hydration. spraying it is SO satisfying i love it so much go buy it rn."
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Malaysia,good,My bf is obsessed with this. We are regular users of thermal water from the drugstore but you can feel this is much more premium as the nozzle spray is much stronger. 
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Singapore,hydrating spray ,Love how it comes in aerosol dispenser form so it can equally dissipates the product on to skin. Quick way to hydrate the skin. Feeling refreshed after use. Can be a good base before starting make up. 
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,New Zealand,it’s okay,tbh I have no clue why I bought this lol actually I do cause it was in the bestseller sections and tbh I shouldn’t have read reviews and such cause this literally only has ike two ingredients 🤨 haven’t had a single clue as to what it does so I just spritz it onto my face like twice a day to see results and tbh nothing has happened. oh well tho 👩‍🦲
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Australia,Perfect for sensitive skin!!,"I love this mist so much, very refreshing and doesn’t dry out!! However I think this is a little overpriced considering it early consists of only two ingredients, natural ingredients "
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,USA,A must have!,Nice refreshing fine mist at a great price! I spray it with my setting spray for a smoother application.
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Malaysia,skincare basis,"Ni macam skincare basis gitewww i really love sebab bila you spray you macam dapat sinaran cahaya mentari menyusuk jiwaku ketika bersamamu, so belilah"
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Malaysia,Easy way to apply toner ,Bought this twice . Like it when you are not in the mood to spend time to splatter the face with cream and lotion. My go to when I got lazy - just spritz and follow with moisturiser. 
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,USA,Seals the deal,"I really enjoy this mist. I do my skin care routine then spray this on, let it sit for about 10-15 seconds then lightly pat (not rub) it in with a beauty blender. My skin looks and feels fresh"
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Singapore,I use this to dampen my BB,"Good to dampen your beauty blender for application of makeup products. I used to use the Elixir instead, but every since the price of that product increased again, I switched over to this and this works pretty well. Much more cost efficient as well. "
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,New Zealand,Cooling ,This is soooo cooling and refreshing. The mister is continous and light. I use after the shower to cool my skin and I think it makes a difference in my skin!
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Australia,great for travel,"For water essentially, it’s great. The size is perfect for travel or your crossover bags. I put mine in my bag which is great for the summer when it’s really hot and you need a refresher. Not too bad pricing for the size tho water will do the job as well. Beauty is expensive. Hehe"
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Australia,good,I don’t think you needed in your life because most of the time I forget to use because I don’t know when to use it doesn’t come in to my schedule that’s Why I barely use it
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,USA,A must for eczema-prone skin,"This is hydrating but more importantly SO SOOTHING. If you’re prone to redness due to skin conditions or sensitives, this helps reduce it so much. Cannot recommend enough for those with sensitive skin."
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,New Zealand,200ml - So refreshing!,"I’m always reluctant buying skincare products as I have sensitive acne-prone combination skin, but this spritz has been such an awesome addition to my skincare routine! I use it right after cleansing AM and PM + anytime I remove makeup, and it instantly leaves my skin feeling nice, cool and refreshed. Absolutely love and will definitely buy again!"

CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Malaysia,raisin juice shower ,"It’s my repeat purchase. It smells like raisin, I’m not a huge fan of the smell but I’m willing to put up with the scent for its soothing effect. The nozzle dispense huge water droplets so expect your face will be wet like a shower. So it is not make-up friendly. 
I’ve skin prone to redness and this helps to calm and hydrates my skin. 

The only down part would be unable to use this over make up. 
"
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Malaysia,WORTH EVERY PENNY!,This is my third bottle of purchase. It is very good to help you fight with acne and fresh your skin. The scent also very soft and not irritated to my skin.
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Singapore,refreshing,This is just a good 'ol classic facial spray to refresh the skin. Good to stock up during sales period as it would come in handy. Prefer travel size so that I can bring it around.
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Singapore,Ms,I think i quite enjoy this mist! The smell is rathef light and exudes a slight hint of grape. It is quite absorbent so you do not have to pat dry. Feels refreshing and does not leave a sticky feeling. 
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Singapore,"As a toner, as a refresher","The coverage for their nozzle spray is amazing. it covers a lot of your face, if not all. the solution feels nice too, I use it as a toner when I'm lazy to use my actual toner and cotton pads, or just as a quick first layer after face wash. "
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,New Zealand,Gorg product for the getting ready table,"I love this stuff! I'm on my second bottle. It is so versatile. I use it to spritz my face if I just need a bit of refreshment. Or on a spoole before dipping into my brow wax, and if I am feeling extra boujie I actually spritz some on my face while a mask is on for a bit of extra hydration!"
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,USA,Caudalie Grape Water - 200ml,"Very hydrating, but has a definitive raisin smell when sprayed. The smell quickly disappears so don’t let it stop you if you’re looking for something hydrating for sensitive skin"
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Australia,Budget friendly luxe toner mist,I really enjoyed using this in summer to refresh and calm down any redness on my skin. Especially when I’ve had a laser hair removal session or my eczema is flaring up on my body. I also used it before applying my hyaluronic acid or any serums. There isn’t a bad fragrance it just smells like water. It absorbs into my skin. This product deserves five stars.
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Malaysia,will repurchase it ! ,itsssss good and refreshing and really soooooothingggggg i swearr at first i was is thats it ? but then i done something that iritate my skin and i spray this one ! and its soootheee it! it workksss and thats why i need this the smell is soft light smell of risin and its really something that i dont want but i really need it !!!!!! 
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Australia,holy grail! ,"Can’t believe how good this is! It’s my holy grail! I’ve never seen or experienced anything like this before ! After I used my cleanser, I sprayed it all over my face. My face felt so calm and moisturised. Doesn’t have a smell neither. So it’s perfect’ kept my skin feeling fresh for hours! Would buy this again and again! "
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,USA,Caudalie Grape Water - 200ml,I bought this off of a TikTok recommendation from Mikayla and it’s so refreshing before makeup or as a part of my skincare routine at night. Before makeup it adds a little dewiness that helps the makeup stick and before bed it helps my hydration products work with a little added help… would definitely recommend this!
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,New Zealand,A good replacement for SeroZinc,"Don't expect a life changing experience. It is a very simple mist with very basic formula. However, it has a really nice mister - the mist comes out fine - not like a hydrant, nor is it so fine you choke on the mist.
It is not perfumed on scented and there is nothing complicated about this product.
Sure, you can ask why not mist with water but it just has that extra bit that keeps my face from drying out after a warm shower. Usually mist immediately after I get out of the shower, followed by skincare.
Is this my holy grail? No. Would I repurchase? Yes (and because I can't find SeroZinc anywhere in NZ)."
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Malaysia,So good,I’m quite in love with Caudalie products and this mist one of their best product. It moisturised my face skin and it has a good spray too. Will purchase it again for sure.
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Malaysia,hydrates well but smells like sugar raisin juice ,"I have a mixed feeling for this. I like that it does it’s job on hydration, my skin feels hydrated and I even sprayed it on my hand’s allergy area and this soothes the allergy. 
This is definitely not for setting makeup as the mist isn’t fine enough. 

The part I don’t like so much is the scent. It smells like strong sickly sweet raisin juice, I need to hold my breath each time I spray it. "
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,New Zealand,Soothing ,"I love this when my skin is super sensitive and can't tolerate much else. especially after using acids, retinol ect. adds a layer of soothing hydration "
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Singapore,Love it!,This is the only beauty product that I have purchase multiple times. Love how the skin feels clean and fresh after each usage. Will always have a bottle at home.
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Canada,Caudalie Grape Water - 200ml,"good cooling mist, hydrates well on the face. love"
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Australia,Soothing and hydrating,I’ve been using this mist for quite a few years now. It’s great to use immediately after cleansing and before applying a hyaluronic acid serum. This combination helps to lock in the moisture and keeps my skin feeling plump and hydrated. I also enjoy using it throughout the day as a pick-me-up to refresh and add extra moisture to my skin. 
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Singapore,Ms.,Love the product. Will definitely repurchase. 
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Philippines,super love this! ,Super love love love love this facial mist!!! This is absolutely refreshing and really soothes my sensitive skin.

I didn't like the smell and felt I could get the same result using spray water."
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Malaysia,Good refresh spray,Put this in the fridge and spray it on my face whenever I need moisture or feeling like my skin is dry. Scent smells good and natural. Like it.
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,USA,So refreshing,"I live in the desert and let me tell you, this is a must have! Feels so refreshing and cool on the skin."
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Canada,meh. not worth it,"honestly I’ve used way better face mists. It doesn’t spray very evenly and consistently. It also has a weird smell to it. 
I’ve used other brands of thermal water face mist that are way better than this. 
I was quite disappointed"
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,New Zealand,Outstanding,"Great price, great product. Honestly its great to carry in the bag and use in the office when you spend the day on the air-con. I recommend it for summer and days where you just need to top up hydration."
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,USA,Caudalie Grape Water - 200ml,Amazing amazing product! This facial mist is very refreshing and moisturizing for throughout the day and to apply before moisturizer. I use this daily and it’s great for my sensitive skin. I give this a good spray all over before applying the rest of my skincare. If you apply hyaluronic acid (which you should) this is a great mist before applying . I’ve been through so many bottles already !
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Australia,Great Product,"Definitely gonna recommend as a toned. You won’t see much benefits in the beginning stages, but it does soothes your skin and the spray feature allows maximum coverage in just 3-4 sprays! Would like to get some other fragrances in it soon… 😍"
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Singapore,ok ok ,"The grape water works normally, tends to be a little sticky after spraying but it’s ok after dabbing it in. Storing it for too long would cause the scent to change a little bit. Overall a normal product. "
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,New Zealand,thumbs up ,"although I'm not sure if this product does anything, it is fun to use and makes me feel bougie. If you have a few extra bucks to spend would recommend but if not it is not necessary and in my opinion more about the experience. "
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,New Zealand,not amazing ,I have sensitive dry skin. I liked the coolness effect it gave in summers. But It gives very less hydration. Overall the product didn’t seem to work for me.
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Malaysia,hydrating ,I keep it in my bag so that I can spray on face any time I want. Very soothing and also hydrating. Can spray when after put on make up. Recommended to buy ! 
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Australia,Love,"I brought the 75ml to trial and will definitely repurchase. 

so convenient and easy to use, adds a cooling light mists of water to my face prior to me adding my serums. 

face looks and feels more hydryated"
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Australia,amazing ,I could spray myself with this all day long. I just don't know how much it hydrates but it feels amazing 
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,USA,Caudalie Grape Water - 200ml,"This is a refreshing mist that really improved my skincare routine. After learning I should be applying hyaluronic acid to damp skin, I needed a facial mist and this was a great choice!"
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Malaysia,Love it,Been using it since the day it arrived. I love it but honestly i dont know if its work. I still use it because it didn't break my skin up. That it's all. 
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,USA,Versatile Moisturizing Mist/ face & body!,I purchased this on a whim since I love Caudalie products. It is an amazing mist & I really enjoy using it on my neck & décolletage area. It’s also fantastic to use as a mist on the body before applying your favorite body lotion.
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,USA,The Best Thing Ever. Holy Grail best.,"This is one of the best beauty products I have found. It refreshes, cools in summer (by evaporation, not chemicals) and leaves my skin soft. I loved the smaller size for keeping in my back, so I hope it’s not discontinued."

CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Malaysia,Mrs,Love how hydrating this product is! However need to reapply few times to lock in the hydration. The smell is like a grape smell and sometimes i just use this as the replacement to toner.
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Canada,Makes Face Burn,"I was hoping to like this product because my face gets quite dry and needs refreshment throughout the day. Unfortunately, this product makes my face burn, so I can't even determine whether it hydrates or not, since I have to take it off right away. Tried three times, same result every time."
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,Singapore,Versatile Product,"A refreshing spritz to help bring moisture back into my skin and glad that it is suitable for all skin types! Good that it is versatile to be use as a toner, post makeup spray and sometimes I will just use as moisturiser and pat it till skin absorbs it."
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,New Zealand,astringent but...,good hydrating mist and regulates sebum to some extent. I expect a bit more... but working well with another resveratrol product I use.

After spraying my face I apply hyaluronic acid serum to absorb on my skin. I then follow up with an antioxidant serum, vitamins c serum, and moisturizing spf. It’s a holy grail. It also looks beautiful when I add a bit of rms highlight to my skin. It works! It has tons of function."
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,USA,Caudalie Grape Water - 200ml,this product is amazing I love it especially if you’ve been out in the sun. I use it several times a day on days that I’m not wearing make up. It feels great on the skin.
CAUDALIE-Grape Water,USA,Refreshing and hydrating,Super refreshing and the spray is super fine and gets on the skin evenly.

FRESH-Kombucha Facial Treatment Essence,USA,A very nice start to my morning routine,"I am liking this product so far! It has been about a month. A little goes a long way, and really preps the skin for the rest of my routine. It does feel a little sticky before it dries completely so it loses a star for that. I used Tatcha’s essence before this and it was lovely but a bit too pricey. This has a slightly lower price point and is a nice product."

FRESH-Kombucha Facial Treatment Essence,USA,Wooo!,"At first I didn’t want to buy into what it claims to do for the skin, but I still wanted to try it to see if it could replace other products that were not working in my skin regimen. After trying it for a few weeks, I noticed that my face didn’t break out as often and if I skipped some days of using it, those were the days that my face got the oiliest.

FRESH-Kombucha Facial Treatment Essence,USA,Hydration in a bottle,I bought the limited edition bottle during Christmas 2020 and I barely finished it in July 2022! I used it about 5 days a week too. I did shriek at the price tag! I had a small bottle and when I ran out I didn’t use it for a few weeks and definitely noticed a huge difference.. which led me to buy the largest bottle. I have combination skin and I mainly used it for dehydration. I tend to use lightweight products so this essence fit right in! This was so worth it!

I am happy others have seemed to enjoy it though"

While it feels a little heavy it absorbs fairly quickly and skin feels hydrated. Not the greatest fan of the scent but then again SKII doesnt smell that great either. For its price point think this is value for money.

Not much for cleansing as i think my double cleansing steps i do every evening is enough to cleanse my face 😍
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,USA,My favorite toner of all time,"I love this product.  I used to hate on toner, especially the pricier ones, but it adds a layer of moisture that I really need with my dry skin.  I personally did not have any of the issues mentioned in other comments - I’ve never had any bits of rose come out of the cap because it’s such a tiny opening.  I’ve also never had issues with the cap."
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,USA,not worth it,"not worth the money. super fragranced, didn’t do anything and tiny bits of the petals got all over when I tried to apply to my skin."
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,Malaysia,best toner,im in love with this toner. it has nice roses smell..not so strong.. and the toner give you so much hydration. will try to purchase the actual size after this

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,Philippines,My holy grail,"I couldn’t bring my large bottle when I traveled, so opted to purchase a travel-size in-store. I love this toner!! It’s the only one that really gives me that hydration that my skin needs. Feels super refreshing on the skin, and is very minimally scented. I don’t know what I would do without this product. "

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,Malaysia,Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,been using this for a week now. can safely say that this toner does help with my dry skin. even my pores are getting smaller. will definitely buy in full size after this!
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,Malaysia,recommended,"good for dehydrated skin. i got this originally in small bottle, now repurposed to big bottles. it instantly relieved the tightness of the skin. Will always repurchase. It didn’t cause me any breakout"
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,USA,Current Favorite Toner!,"As someone with combination skin who prefers her toner to be slightly more on the hydrating side, I look forward to using this despite not being the biggest toner person. The aesthetics of this product are a solid 10/10 and if you enjoy rose scented anything, you would like this (though the smell can be a bit too strong but I still like it). I feel like it really helps clean up any remaining makeup from my face and especially my neck after using a cleansing balm if I have any left. Initially got the smaller size to try but ran through that very quick so upsized as soon as I could!"
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,USA,Top broke on travel size while opening,It seems like a nice toner but just as soon as I opened my 100 ml travel sized one the top broke rendering it useless to me as I fly out in a few hours. I’m so disappointed as I’ll be backpacking for the next month and was counting on this toner. To have spent so much money on it to then have this weak top is extremely disappointing.
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,Malaysia,in love,very very very in love with this toner. my skin feel so hydrated after using it. because really love it i repurchase a bigger size which is 400ml. very good purchase.
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,Taiwan,Kim,"My second bottle! Got it during sales, and girls really buy it during sales, it will worth every penny.

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,USA,Its like just plain water No benefits seen.,Its like putting plain water on my face i dont feel or see what it could be doing to by skin. I dont see it helping. I will be returning it.
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,Singapore,good buy!,"feels very lightweight when on skin, i use it twice a day — morning and night. it definitely helped diffuse my pores a little & my skin isn’t as oily as it used to be. overall a good purchase(: "
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,Singapore,fresh ,Rose deep hydration facial toner second time purchase really can see results of my skin  pore are become smaller good for sensitive skin highly recommended and will continue to used the product 
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,Malaysia,its ok i guess,"ive only used this product for almost a week and its just ok. on the first day i wore this my face became greenish in colour. after that its starting to look like my skin colour. during application it feels sticky and my dry patches is still present. after my skincare is done, i can only feel the hydration after like half an hour. skin feels smooth and hydrated. but its like the sticky/heavy hydrated type and i dont really like it. it doesnt claim to be brightening, but i wish this would also help brighten my dullness since this product caters to dry skin. i would like to continue using this until it finishes and see the results after a month or two.  until then im giving it 4 stars as it does hydrate my face, but the finishing of the hydration missed the 1 star. "
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,Canada,FRESH Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner - 250ml,"Smell so delicious! Literally feel the skin drinking up , hydrated ,and luminous ! Highly recommend this toner! Love love love!"
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,USA,Gentle but nothing special,"First of all, I love Fresh products!  But this one is just okay.  This toner did not increase the hydration or texture of my skin after 2 weeks of regular use.  It smells lovely and it didn’t irritate my sensitive skin, so I am keeping it in the medicine cabinet for those occasional times where I may need a toner to remove residue after cleansing.  But this won’t become a regular part of my routine and I doubt I will purchase it again."
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner,USA,FRESH Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner - 250ml,I didn’t like it. My skin doesn’t feel good after . It actually dried it out. 2 stars for the bottle which is beautiful. But the product unfortunately sucks

Maybe some of u will think that this price is overprice for the toner! But believe me, it isn’t!  At first also I thought like that, but after I bought my 1st bottle long time ago, maybe 5 years back, and bought another brand which was cheaper than this toner ( because I was thinking that toner is JUST A TONER, no need to buy so expensive) I back to this toner until now! My skin is very sensitive and breakouts easily, thanks to this toner, I feel my skin is better! It’s a part of skin care, u can’t feel the result for immediately, take time! It’s really good, that’s why now I give a review for this product. You can feel your skin is better, softer and moist, all the redness also gone! "

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,good,"I heard so much raves about this and I gave in eventually. I didnt really wanted to buy this because fresh has a ton of fragrance and my skin is extremely sensitive. however, this toner didn't flare up my eczema which I'm thankful for. it was very soothing as well - it hydrates my face. I might repurchase this. "
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Malaysia,Ordinary Toner,"i feel that it is just like any regular toner. the smell of rose is kinda strong for me. i hope to see more improvements on my skin after using it longer. anyway, the cap is so fragile that after i dropped it onto the ground, it broke and now i cannot recap :/ "

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Malaysia,Ok,There's not much hydration in this product that I expected. It doesn't leave the skin feeling hydrated or plump like other brands I've tried before. Price is also more expensive than most.
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Malaysia,"The Best Toner, Fullstop","I’ve been using Fresh Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner for almost 5 years now, there’s no turning back. My skin agrees with this and it hydrates my skin like no other. I love patting this onto the skin few times before my skincare routine. Keeps my skin soft & hydrated. During the hot weather season, doing that keeps my skin cool. For an avid user, buying the bigger size gives more value for your money. Yes I know the rose petals makes it hard to pour out the toner once it’s about to finish but I can look past that for the benefit this toner gives me. Like I said, there’s no turning back. "

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,Limited Edition,"I bought it for my sister. 
I tried before sample size facial toner and the smell is nice & fresh. "
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,big fan ,"The only downside of this product was how expensive it was (although, if you buy the 400ml bottle it works out to cost less per ml). My skin loves this product. It is absorbed instantly and has a pleasant rose scent. The little rose petal bits also get incorporated into the toner and you can actually rub it to dissolve it onto your skin, if that makes sense? "
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,fresh rose deep hydrating facial toner ,"Highly recommend for sensitive and combination skin like me. First time using fresh toner and love it! My skin is more hydrate and no break out! Will continue to use in future! 
"

I was given a free sample and I fell in live with and decided to buy this limited edition. It smells amazing. I would definitely  repurchase it. 
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,Loving the hydration,"I usually like to change out my skincare products after a while, but for this toner, I am currently on my 3 consecutive bottles. I just love the smell & the hydration! I can really feel the difference! But one thing about Fresh is that almost all of their packaging are made of plastic, and they didn’t indicate if the plastic they use are recyclable in Singapore or if they have any related green initiative. "

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Malaysia,loving it,"Really really love this toner, and love the scent too, It’s so calming! The one thing that i dislike is the rose petal is clogging the bottle, you have to shake off the rose petal every time you use."
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Malaysia,Good,"Used this hydration toner for nearly a month. The rose fragrance is soo lovely. I only use this range at night as it is  very relaxing to use Fresh Rose moisturizer, toner and mask.  A bit like aromatherapy. Just perfect. "
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Malaysia,Lovely,"This was a random buy during the brand's 20% offer. Influencers suggested this toner a lot and I was curious to try. After a month of trying this out, it made my skin soft and hydrated. Thankfully no breakout from it. I take half star off because of the smell, for me it was too strong and artificial. The smell dissipate after a while. I might repurchase."
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Australia,my best rose water,"It is the best rose water I’ve ever used! The price is great, compared to its smaller size. I love rose water so much! I use it for wet mask to boost hydration to my face! Highly recommended!"

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Malaysia,rose 🌹 ,Love the rose scent. After applying on face like doing SPA. The smell make me feel relax. Im sharing this toner with my mum. She like the rose scent too. 
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Malaysia,Hydrating toner to try,This bottle could last me for months for sure. I love how calming and hydrating it is on the skin. It’s more value for money for sure on this jumbo size. One star lesser as the ending of the rose petals will make the product harder to come out towards the end and another half point for the price point as there are many other hydrating toners on the market in Kbeauty that can do the same purpose. 
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Australia,Amazing!,"Love this product. Smells amazing, love the look of it with rose petals floating in there. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed, supple and moisturized. I think the only annoying thing is that towards the end of the bottle, the rose petals keeps blocking the liquid from coming out.  "
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Australia,Amazing ,This bottle is so great! It’s 400ml of pure goodness and the nozzle is great to avoid spillage. It smells so good and feels very refreshing 
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,Lightweight and refreshing,This toner has a nice scent. It's not harsh on my sensitive skin and love how it leaves a refreshing feeling on my skin.

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Australia,Best toner at all time,I have to purchase this limited edition cos I love rose toner. Tried other brands but have to come back to Fresh cos this is the only toner that get absorbed into the skin and make it glow and dewy. This is my 4th time repurchase 
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,ms,"I’ve been using the 250ml for awhile now and this was a steal for the quantity and price. However I was shocked to find out that this limited ed 400ml doesn’t come with a seal or packaging. And also, there is no stopper at the top. It would be perfect if it’s sealed up.. "
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,Highly recommended ,This toner is the best selling product among all the Fresh products. It has a very gentle rose smells and soothing effect. Highly recommended this product.
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,New Zealand,Perfect for Summer,This Fat Water is perfect to use in summer season. It is not sticky and do not become oily. It will keep your skin hydrated. Allow sometime to dry before you apply moisturizer
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,New Zealand,toner serum,"I have been trying to introduce toner and serum to my routine so this seemed perfect. I enjoy the consistency, it makes my skin feel hydrated without feeling sticky. I’m not the biggest fan of the lid/applicator as it can be hard to control how much product you get. "
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,literally so stunning,"Sorry but can we talk about the fact that this is the best toner I have ever used??? Not only is it a cutie little bottle but it also smells amazing and just really draws everything out of your skin while still feeling hydrating, and minimising your pores. I’m obsessed
"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Malaysia,thicker toner,"Would say treat this as a toner, it is moisturising but there is something inside that Orestes my skin occasionally. I am guessing the fragrance because it is quite strong. My skin isn’t usually sensitive but this irritated it."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,wonderful ,great toner. has cleared my dark spots very quickly and helped my skin feel hydrated and smooth. it is great for sensitive skin would love to buy more products from this brand but they are always sold out and i can see why! 
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,New Zealand,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"Hydrating, refining, soothing. Love this toner. 
I have slightly enlarged pores and often deal with congestion. I also have dehydrated skin. So I love the combination you receive of pore refining and hydrating with this product. Love the serum consistency also."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,New Zealand,Doing ?? anything,Leaves my skin looking amazing for a period of time after application but is this actually doing anything positive for my skin whatsoever? Who knows.. unsure if this is necessary and the same result could be achieved with my previous toner and spf during the day
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Singapore,not for me,I personally didn't see any changes to my skin after using this toner. It definitely does not dry out the skin like some toners but I definitely won't be getting it again.
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,bottle after bottle you know it’s good,"I love this toner. It’s unique formula is perfect for my combo oily skin no matter what season. It absorbs quickly, provides hydration and the niacinamide has made a big difference to my skin in conjunction with my other skin care products. I am now onto my third bottle! That’s how you know it’s good. "
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Singapore,Fan of Fenty ❤️,"I do love the texture.It's got more body than the toners I'm used to, like a really thin gel.It's nice and I'm looking forward to looking at my skin over continued use..When I squeezed it into my hands, I was intrigued by its lightweight gel texture.After pressing it into my skin with my hands and letting it soak in,my skin was incredibly hydrated, plump, and glowing.."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Malaysia,i love the toner,i think its very works on my skin.... coz i feel moisture when i use the toner...will continue buy for the seconds time coz i love the toner.....thanks fenty coz make i love the product 
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Canada,Part of my favorite daily skincare routine,This is a must have - my favorite skin toner. I have combination skin and most toners I've used in the past have dried out my skin. I can't live without this one. Feels amazing putting on.
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,Farnaz,"I love this product and this is my second time purchasing, you should try the cleanser as well before using this product, they are amazing together, will buy again "
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,fresh skin!,"It’s a thick liquid that absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling tight but not dry. It’s natural and smells very pleasant. The only thing is I like using a serum and this is a toner serum, I wasn’t sure if it was a waste layering my serum over it but I do so anyway."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,No going back,"This is the best cleanser I’ve ever used, it smells absolutely beautiful and it feels so soft to rub into my skin. It’s clearing up my acne and my redness and omg I love it so much, pricey but worth it because it’s big."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Singapore,Unique texture ,"I like that out of all the products in the skin care range, this has the least scent to it. Or at least the most pleasant scent. I liked to use this when I wasn’t wearing make up for the day. Unfortunately because I found it too heavy for my skin, i decided to give it away instead."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Singapore,great buy! ,"this serum x toner absorbs super well into my skin, only takes a few seconds before it dries, doesn’t feel sticky at all! more towards a serum consistency & the fragrance smells good!"

I love that I can just pour it out and put it on the skin rather than having to grab a cotton pad/cloth. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and clean.
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,I love this ,"This product is great. Nice texture, evens out pores, smells great! My mum even loves it. If you have dry skin though, I'd avoid this. The milky toner Fenty does is THE BEST - try that! "
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,Miracle Water,"After years of thinking toners were bad for my skin as they always left it dry and tight, this is a game changer. I was initially skeptical when the salesperson suggested it as I’m not necessarily a Rihanna fan and I generally distrust celebrity products (except my beloved JVN) Within 2 days, I saw a remarkable difference and knew this would become a staple. My skin feels tightened but not uncomfortable. It’s well hydrated and definitely helps my moisturiser absorb better. "
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Regret not taking a before & after,"I call thisi the lazy girls toner because I never used to tone because of the addittional step to reach for the cotton balls. I wish I would have taken a before an after because I can see the difference in just 3 weeks. My skin is brighter, and my pores are smaller! Woo!"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Love it already!,"I love it. I can tell it’s tightening up my pores because it’s easier to hide them with my makeup. It helps my acne clear up faster (I break out during PMS), it makes my face soft, and I like that it dries quickly."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Singapore,loves it,"I got a small sample of it and once i finished it, i purchased the full sized bottle. i have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin & this product did not break me out. my skin felt soft and supple and it also smoothed out my skin texture. it is also pretty affordable as compared to other brands. i'm so happy my skin loves this."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Must have!,This product is truly amazing and works amazing when paired with the Fenty skin moisturizer. I work in the film industry and we have long hours that sometimes get unpredictable and even the travel size helped so much.
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,New Zealand,perfect toner serum,this has helped hydrate my skin so well. it is a great product and perfect before you go to bed and when you wake up. i have definitely noticed a change in my skin hydration and clarity since using this product. 
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,New Zealand,Meh,Not worth the hype! I heard a lot of good things about it but didn’t really do much. Made my skin oily and sticky even with the smallest amounts. Purchased twice and won’t be again..
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,"A little sticky, but good, non-drying,for body too","It took me a while to get to write a review on this. I've been using it for quite a while now, as I got it soon after it launched. I've gone through different phases with this product. I've had situations when I've loved it and I've kinda disliked it, but my overall conclusion is that I love it. It is light, yet thicker than most toners, and you could probably get away with only wearing this on your skin in certain situations. What I don't like about it is that sometimes it gives me the feeling of an uneven, kind of sticky texture. However, it does have a lot of nice products in it, it's good under make up, it has niacinamide, and the packaging is big. It feels better than many other products with niacinamide. I've found that it works well on my body. I've been using it when my skin is slightly irritated by rubbing or after shaving. I've found a positive effect on my body and it actually feels softer there than on the face. For some reason it also helps if my skin is itchy. I would buy this even just to use on my body. It isn't drying at all - my skin is quite dry and it doesn't dry me out. I haven't seen the pore-refining effect but I don't really struggle with my pores most of the time anyway. I got it because it seemed like a unique formulation and I really wanted to try it. I just like it. You just gotta make sure to keep the upper part of the bottle clean, as the product touches its surface as it comes out."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,New Zealand,not bad,"I have sensitive skin so use this now and again , I really like it was skeptical once ordered because of the witch hayzel , but it's not bad , thank you"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Holy Grail,"I purchased this thanks to my cousin! She is on her 2nd bottle so I knew I had to give it a try , my skin feels so good and looks even better!"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,New Zealand,Dr,Amazing product. leaves my skin feeling fresh and smooth. Lasts all day long. has visibly reduced pores and made my skin appear brighter. extremely light on the skin
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Singapore,Amazing toner,definitely the best toner I've tried and gonna repeat order. grab this guys really does the job well and keeps the skin clean and smooth. the way to flawless and glowy skin
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Singapore,"feels nice, smells even nicer","I've used serums like Farsali before, which did nothing at all for the skin IMO. Fenty Fat Water is totally different! pores did feel more refined, skin testure looked better after just one week of use! some people complain that it smells overly strong but I do enjoy the scent, which I think smells very ""yummy"". i do recommend this product!"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Love it!,"Context: I’m an oily girl!!! I’m always a bit hesitant with adding skin products to my face routine bc typically- the more products I add, the more oily I get. HOWEVER- I love this stuff. I put it on after I wash my face and before I add my
Moisturizer and sunscreen. A tiny drop goes a long way for my oily face which means this bottle will last me awhile. My skin feels smoother and looks glowy. I also do think my pores appear smaller."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Not a fan,"I was disappointed. The water feels oily, don’t recommend if you have combination skin or if you’re in a humid environment. I had to wipe my hands after applying because it leaves a “film” like feeling or texture on your hands and face. Leaves your face shiny even after it dries. Not in a dewey cute way, more like greasy.
Don’t like the scent, and you will smell it all day. It’s a little overwhelming."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,love love it!!,"I’m OBSESSED with this product. I’ve used half of the bottle within a couple weeks,  with day and night application. Riri didn’t disappoint with this serum. It seriously is the best for my oily combination skin."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,Phaaaat water ,"This is the best if you lazy like me, 2 steps in one product "
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Singapore,"it’s thin, it’s thick ","had a sample size and tried it. The way it sat on my skin and eased away the dry patches?? I have hairy and kinda bumpy skin, so make up sits and kinda emphasis texture. With this it’s not as noticeable and it wears very well throughout the day. No patchy areas. Doesn’t sting the eyes too "
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Go to product.,One of my fav products. Leaves my face feeling soft. Can use day and night.
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,i like it,"I’ve been using this product for almost a year and I have to say while I am using lots of other products as part of my skincare routine, I can’t really say this has a noticeable difference. However, it hasn’t made me break out at all so it can’t be all that bad"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Fenty Skin Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Really like the way this toner makes my skin feel and it smells great too! Definitely helps the pores!!
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,New Zealand,Fenty Fat water toner,LOVE this!!! I have acne prone skin (hormonal) and have been using this for 2 months. I’ve noticed this has calmed and prevented breakouts. Highly recommend!!! 
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Canada,Fenty Skin Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,"I *love* this toner. It smells so good, it’s non-sticky, it feels great on my skin and it has evened out my complexion. Highly recommend."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Singapore,good toner,"Easy to use toner, that left the skin feeling a bit sticky in a good way, so make up sits nicely on it. You can use this and skip serum step if you have easy skin"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,good product; terrible nozzle,Product itself is great but very difficult to get out of the bottle. The water is actually quite dense and so you have to bang the lid before you get anything out.
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,fat Water me please,"❤️ I love love this stuff. My skin if finally even! Been using since march. Don’t expect instant result, but over time by skin got smoother and brighter"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Singapore,Mdm,"I Used together with the FEnty moisturiser SPF!! No regrets!! Wonderful combo! Helped to minimise my pores, skin feels clean ready for skincare. The texture is thicker than usual toners. Like described.. it’s a toner serum. So don’t expect it to be watery "
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,New Zealand,Great toner for fresh skin look,"I like the twist and squeeze design and it does have mild fragrance which didn't last any longer. it hydrates and smooth the skin very well , also gives a refreshing look to face . looking forward to try full range fenty skincare. "
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Fenty Skin Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,I was a little skeptical at first because of the consistency but this is a must have. A definite game changer love it!
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Love!!,"I’ve been using this for about a month and my skin is softer, blemish free (scars aside) and a little goes a long way. You really don’t need more than a dime-size because it’s both a toner and serum, so it’s a bit thicker than regular toner. 

Bottom line: Love it and it’s now a permanent part of my skincare routine."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,Great mix of toner/serum,This product is so interesting - half toner half serum. It felt like I was using a luxury product. If you prefer to have a toner as part of your routine (ie balance out the skin after a wash) you may not like the consistency of the product but i did like how it felt more like a serum. I have combination oily skin so it worked for me as part of my regular face routine. I particularly liked the glowy feel to the face after using.
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,my daily essential.,Made a huge improvement in the tone of my skin and help my adult acne. I love this stuff
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,New Zealand,love this ,I first tried out the trio combo this worked so well on my face. I have dry skin and throughout the day I can get a really oily t zone so I first purchased the small pack to try it out and it was so great I had to get the bigger one. I love how it has 2 steps combined in one. it's such a clever idea. It felt great on my skin especially when you can just use your clean hands to apply it on your face
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Best Serum for the Money,"I got a mini size of this as a gift over two years ago and i have used it everyday ever since. My skin has never been this smooth, blemish free, and soft. I used the whole line of fenty products and they are all TOP TEIR!!"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Singapore,Smooth skin,"I have no issues with this and it helps to smooth my textured skin. I do like the smell of it, however, I'm not sure if the fragrance is making my skin have tiny bumps. I don't use it often but it's nice to have on my vanity."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Canada,Fenty Skin Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,LOVE! Really adds a nice softness and shine to my skin. A little goes a long way. People have complimented my skin ever since I started using this + face wash + SPF face cream. I’m obsessed
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Overall Weird,"It has a really weird texture, it’s super thick. It also smells weird. I haven’t noticed any difference in my skin."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Recommend!,"I had a mini of this product and used it consistently every morning until it was gone, but even so it lasted me a long time. I definitely noticed a difference when it came to my dark spots (I would occasionally get a pimple and it would leave a dark spot behind afterwards). They healed a lot faster than they normally did. Aside from that, I also enjoyed the formula and how lightweight but refreshing it was. I didn't have issues with it being sticky, but I used small amounts."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Fenty Skin Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Excellent! Delivers great skin results as suggested. After trails with other brands I choose Fenty Skin as the best toner for my face.
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Awesome,"I noticed a difference in 3 days cant wait to after a month. It feels sticky at first then it's gone. I glow all day
 The only thing is I have really oily skin haven't seen an approvement on that part"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Fenty Skin Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,I use FENTY Fat Water twice a day. Mornings and evenings. Keeps my complexion even and smooth. I can’t live without it! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,not bad,this actually made my pores more refined and look smaller i like to use it after i exfoliate with the paula’s choice one. it takes a while to soak into your skin but looks good the next day
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Malaysia,Best toner ever!,"I barely ever rave about a product, but this is the best exception! Love what its done to my face. Its brightened up my face tremendously. 

Only thing slacking is the packaging, feels a little unhygienic the way you pump it out, but i'll still give it 5 stars cause the product is amazing!"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Canada,Didn't see any difference,"I was really excited to try this as I have never heard of a ""toner serum"" before. Anything that simplifies my routine will get my attention. Unfortunately, after using over half the bottle and after 2 months of continued use, I have not seen any significant difference. Its slightly hydrating but that's it. Not a big fan of the scent. Bottle is okay. For the results and price I will not be purchasing again."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,"love the formula, not a fan of the bottle","Really loved this product and I love how my skin drinks it up. I would it give it a full 5 stars but I would lying if I said the packaging is completely perfect, I’d love to maybe see a pump or spray format of the packaging because the plastic can sometimes hurt to squeeze product out and it can be less painful for those who have arthritis but that being said, I do enjoy the formula to repurchase and recommend."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,love ,This is the best toner I’ve ever used! Hands down. Love the texture of this product and the way that it makes your skin feel afterwards is amazing.       
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,take my money hunni,"I love this product so much I use it day and 
night I will use it until I die or until they stop making it this is why I love Fenty skin the packaging is awesome it just squids out the top but you can close it for Travel and I love love love would recommend"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Works on Sensitive Skin,"I have really sensitive skin, so I usually have trouble with toners because they irritate my face, but I've had NO issues with this product. S/o Riri."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,Soothing,"I decided to try this out, it smells really good and is so gentle on my skin, I love the way it opens and it's a nice step in my skincare routine and it makes me feel relaxed. However, it didn't make my dark spots fade away quicker but I noticed I had less brrakouts"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,love it,"improved my skin texture, particularly on my nose my pores look much better and less irritation, no waste, easy to use. No mess, no cotton pad required, have repurchased "
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Singapore,will definitely repurchase ,"Didn’t think much of this product originally as I’m not into celebrity branded skincare however I thoroughly enjoyed using this! Now I can’t live without this in my skincare arsenal. My skin feels so smooth, plump and hydrated after continued usage twice daily. No more tight feeling after cleansing. This will last a loooong time as such a small amount is only required. Will definitely repurchase!"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Canada,Fenty Skin Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Love this! Ive been using this about a month and it has significantly helped my breakouts and has even faded dark spots.  Doesn't feel heavy and layers well with other skin care products.
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Malaysia,Nice product,Already used half bottle of this. Moisturise my skin even when i dont apply moisturiser afterwards. But didnt do much different to my skin. 50/50 to rebuy this. 
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,Fenty Fat Water,My GF absolutely loves this. She would bathe in it if it was available. She can not stop raving about how good this product is. She says that nothing works as well as this and that it is the absolute best toner in the market. 
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,truly helps if you have oily skin,This toner is amazing! It plumps your skin and blurs your pore but does not leave your skin greasy. It actually has majorly helped my skin to be less oily throughout the day and keep my t-zone from becoming ultra shiny under my makeup. Love it!
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Fenty Skin Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,"This is pretty hydrating, and I like the packaging for ease of use. May or may not buy it again, but it’s effective."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,Lovely and soothing,"I love this fat water toner from Fenty. It smells divine and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth. It will go a long way as you only need a little each use. I love the way it makes my skin feel after cleansing, it hydrates and soothes the skin!"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Dewy & Refreshing,"I love how this fat water makes my skin feel and look! I have dry/combo skin and can wear this winter and summer. I see a definite difference in my skin when I don’t, it’s more dry and less dewy. It feels refreshing as a bonus!"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Fenty Skin Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,"I have combination skin with some texture. This smells good & absorbs quickly in the skin. Like another comment mentioned it feels good but doesn’t do much, and I agree. It didn’t make me break out or anything but I don’t notice a difference in my skin as far as brightening goes but it does help with my oil. It’s been over a month. I probably won’t repurchase once I use it all."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,it’s not bad,i bought this back in January. i think it is a really good toner but i have used better. i think dents has great products but this one is not up to standard with the rest. it doesn’t show great results regarding “pore-refinement” and it doesn’t soak into the skin that well. i don’t feel that refreshed or get the results i expect from a toner with this. not bad but there is better 
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Canada,My new favourite toner!,"Absolutely love this! It's thick and easy to apply onto my skin - and my skin easily absorbs it. I am not a big fan of the other Fenty Skin products - but this toner is my favourite! I noticed a difference in my skin within less than a week, plus it smells super good too!"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Canada,Did Wonders for my Acne & PIH,"I first bought this to see if it would anyway help with boosting my complexion and PIH/dark spots on my face. I was hoping that this product would slightly help with my complexion and expecting it to cause acne breakouts and/or irritation on my sensitive skin. Sometimes I get surprised by which products my skin decides not to react to. I was speechless with the results that this toner gave me ...and then when my speechlessness recovered I couldn't stop talking about it!
My acne went from roughly 50% severe (average pencil eraser-head sized) and 50% cystic (dime-sized) to 40% severe, 30% cystic (Jan 2022) to 30% severe & 20% cystic (May 2022). 
This product also lightened up my PIH from a dark brown to a less dark brown and helped (along with rest of my skincare) erase some dark marks. 
It smells like a tropical cherry and floral combo, sweeter, more tropical, less intense than the cleanser. The smell vanishes within 3 minutes.

This toner feels like a loose gel or a serum in my hands. I prefer to use my hands to apply this. Fat water toner has the EXACT SAME texture on the face as the Avène anti-imperfection concentrate. I 100% believe that there were some cosmetic formulators/scientists/chemists shared between the teams behind these products. On top of it, both companies have French connections (Avène is French and Fenty Skin is co-owned by LVMH). You cannot convince me otherwise.

The packaging is nice, pretty, and sleek. While I usually prefer pumps for serum, I like this method of pouring out the toner as for me, the toner is too liquid-y to be a proper serum. 
 I like the quantity, 50 mL lasts ~1.5 months sporadically used (1-2 times a week) and 150 mL is enough for alternate day application on my face for 4 months.

A staple in my skincare routine & must-have product in regards to my acne, PIH, and dark marks. Strongly recommend."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Canada,Fenty Skin Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,"On first use, it felt really nice on my skin but just 2 days later my skin started breaking out like crazy. I wouldn’t recommend this product if you have sensitive skin."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,New Zealand,Average,I really wanted to love this product based on all the positive reviews however I didn’t really notice much of a difference when it came to reducing pores. One thing I did really like about this product is that it gave an amazing healthy glow/look to my skin.
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Destroyed my skin,"This product DESTROYED my skin its far from a pore refiner it actually broke my skin out really bad to the point i discontinued using it and this was only in the first couple of days of me trying this product. I am an African American woman, and this product did nothing for my skin but irritate it. There are way better toners, serums, and skin care lines to use that's reasonably priced. This is nothing but water and sticky stuff in an ergonomic bottle. Great packaging and concept horrible product.  I have to give this product a thumbs down."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Fenty Skin Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Love this! Feels so smoothing and moisturizing and nourishing. I’ve noticed a difference in my pores overall look of my skin.
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,love it,Love it! Would buy it again. It has really helped my skin. I love that it’s a clean product. I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loved it so much that I decided to buy myself the whole set.
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Malaysia,Essential supplement to skincare routine,"Been reading rave reviews about the 'Fat Water' and I have decided to try one! The Fenty serum is unusually fragrant for a toner, however, I like to use it as a base for my skincare routine. I love how it comforts my skin and refines my pores, making it less noticeable. Definitely will repurchase!"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Singapore,Fat water indeed,"Helps to lock it moisture in the skin and has a nice and light vanilla smell to it. However, i have to pair it with other products to make sure my skin is sufficiently moisturised. Will have to continue to use to see if it helps to refine my pores as there isn’t any obvious results yet after using it for 2 weeks."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Fenty Skin Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,I’m finally reviewing this after going through two bottles and I can confidently say it’s my favorite Fenty Skin product so far. It feels soothing and moisturizing. I use it as a toner with Hydra Vizor. With those products I haven’t had issues with my oily skin and usual liquid foundation with powder routine. I replaced the Fat Water cap with a pump nozzle top for easier use. I didn’t like the way it dispenses with the original cap.
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Fenty Skin Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,This has been amazing on my skin it’s my first toner and I can feel the affects it has on my skin. Highly recommended
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Great seasonal toner for humid weather,"I have combo dry skin, and when it’s hot-humid-sticky weather, I get tiny zit like bumps around my T-zone.  Needless to say, this toner is used for this weather.

My skincare routine is catered to the seasons, so it changes as needed. I don’t wash my face with soap twice a day, I do it once a day so I don’t strip away too much of my natural oils. I feel like this toner could have a higher performance potential on healthy “skin barriers”. 

I didn’t get this to “shrink” my pores, rather I got this to protect my pores from clogging invasions from a multitude of foreign threats.  I like to apply this toner after light exfoliation to avoid dead skin cells from teaming up together and clumping. I do get a light tingling sensation when applied, and I do notice some shine control where my problem pores are. It helped reduce the look of enlarged pores. I like to spread the product and lightly pat the product into my skin where I need a bit more help. I like that it has vitamin C and niacinamide, so it’s a pretty good summer toner to apply for improved spf benefits from sun protection.

I personally wouldn’t use this toner on dryer weather like winter. My go-to is Laneige or Fresh for that. This product works for me, and good luck for people still looking for a product that can work for them."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Canada,Fenty Skin Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,love it so much will buy again. love fenty products
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,so so product,"Don’t get me wrong, this product smells fantastic and has a great consistency but overall, this toner is underwhelming. It doesn’t leave my face feeling replenished and is just underwhelming. I’m glad I was able to try it but I wouldn’t purchase it again"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,a baddie of a fatty.,"If you have not tried this, you are sleeping on it. i only tried it because it has a toner and serum combined. It is easy to use and lightweight. I really really like this a lot. i highly recommend for my combo mature skin."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Australia,Fenty Skin serum,"I absolutely love the Fenty serum, staff were wonderful in helping me. Turning 50, I wanted to do a review on my skin care routine. It’s now a part of my everyday skin care routine."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Save your money.,"I really wanted to like this product. I have large pores in my T-zone, and I was really hoping for my pores to be “refined” like what the product claims it does. Fat water did nothing for my pores, in fact, I feel like it clogged my pores. It also leaves my skin feeling extremely dry and tight… not hydrating at all. I’m practically dying to put moisturizer on my face immediately after this product. I’d save your money on this one. It feels pretty useless putting it on. There are far better skincare products out there. 
The only pros are that it smells amazing and the packaging is beautiful."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,Singapore,supple skin,"it's slightly tacky after use but it makes a great base for the next skin care steps. it helps to absorb serums, essences & moisturizers into the skin and leave your skin very supple without being sticky. glad I bought the trial size because I could move on to the bigger bottle. "
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,THIS WILL DRY YOU OUT,My skin has dry patches now it’s dry and my skin feels tight after using this. I’ve never had dry patches in my life til using this.
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Pore-Refining Toner Serum,USA,Great addition to my beauty routine.,First time customer! I have used the fat water weekly for one month and I love it. It compliments my weekend beauty routine perfectly. It's hydrating. I love the drying time. The light scent and packaging are also high selling points. It's great stuff!
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,Malaysia,best lotion ever,"Love this lotion, it makes my skin stable and smooth. Used to have acne on and off. After using this lotion it make my skin stable and moisture. Re-purchase the lotion for a few times and definitely will re-purchase again! "
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,Malaysia,love love it,Been constantly using this for a while and i love the texture of it and made my face smooths and absorbing too. No fragrance and its not as expensive as SKii. This is my go to essence and recommend this!
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Very Good Addition to the Skin Care Routine!,"I recvd this product complimentary for my honest review from Influenster. I use serums and moisturizers more than most and I can say I nearly know them all. This one is for someone that doesn’t need a excess heavy type serum. If u need a light to medium Amt this very thin micro essence is perfect for a daily routine and I do see a slight improvement in my skin. I will say that though with the size of the sample it’s hard to notice a high difference as it just isn’t enough but I think for someone who uses essence every day this is def one worth trying. I have very sensitive skin and it did Not make me break out. I will also state it has a scent to it also. I found it pleasant but for the people out there who want there skin care items I scented, you won’t like this one. So all in all 4 of 5 stars. Very Nice!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,"I received this complimentary from Influenster in exchange for a review. Overall, I liked this product. I have sensitive skin and this didn’t cause any irritation. I didn’t notice any reduction in redness, which I was hoping for. It’s fine, but I wouldn’t say it’s great."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Nice Face Product,"I really liked this sample that I received from Influenster to test in exchange for my honest review.  The sample I received lasted about 2 weeks so not enough to see a big difference, but I really liked how it made my skin feel smooth,soft, & fresh feeling. I used it morning & night after cleansing and before moisturizing. I would purchase again."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,I Definitely Notice the Difference in My Skin,"I received this product a few weeks ago from Influenster to test. I noticed it didn’t dry my skin, it was easy to apply, it brightened my face slightly, and it leaves my skin very smooth. The only con for me personally is that it has a strong scent. I’m sensitive to smells so it affects me more than it might others. Overall it’s a good product."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,On the fence,"This is a decent product. It’s not a total miss but it’s not a wow factor for me. I got a sample size to try courtesy of Influenster. I’ve used it up now and I don’t really miss it in my routine. I think it feels nice on my dry skin but other than that, it’s nothing I truly miss in my regimen. But it does have a nice feel to it."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,What does it do? I've used it for a month now and I can't see any difference in my skin. I'm not sure I understood the purpose for it. I can absolutely skip this as part of my skincare routine in the future.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Excellent hydration and reduction of lines!!,"“I received this product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder for my honest review” I have used this product since receiving it for quite awhile now and I can say that I have seen a reduction in lines and my skin has never been more hydrated. It works great with makeup, I have not had any skin sensitivity or break outs from it. The drawback is that it is very liquid not at all like a traditional lotion. But once I got used to that I LOVE it!!! I highly recommend the product. The cost is on the upper end but I personally will purchase this item again."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Didn't see a difference,"This product has a watery consistency, I applied it like a toner, it absorbed well and made me feel hydrated however I haven't noticed any change on my skin. I think I need to apply it for a longer time to notice the difference"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Not for oily skin,"This claims to lock in moisture, and it definitely does that. My skin can get a little oily sometimes, and when I used this it made me oily after awhile. I would definitely recommend if you have dry skin, but not for oily. My favorite thing about this is that it absorbed instantly when you put it on your face. I applied with my fingers."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,"This product moisturized my skin without feeling heavy or oily . Instantly gave my face a refreshed look ! I used it after showering , both Morning and night . Would recommend and would buy again!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,Wow I am impressed by this essence! Initially I didn't expect much from this but only after few applications I noticed my skin is more subtle and radiant. Following products absorb much quicker! Highly recommend
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Lovely if you have the money,"Let’s address the elephant in the room- this Essence Treatment Lotion is exorbitantly priced, but it’s actually cheaper than its competitors. It gives more of an immediate effect to my skin than SK-II’s Facial Treatment Essence, though I’ve only tried trial sizes of both and can’t speak to long term effects of either. I also got less oily during the day with EL’s product versus Amore Pacific’s Vintage Single Extract Essence. I never had any pilling when using Micro Essence Treatment Lotion; it played nice with every product I put over it whether that was an anti-aging, anti-acne, or any other product. I could pat it in at any time, using only my palms, and get soothed, calm, even skin. It was lightly hydrating and helped amp up any moisturizer I used on top of it.

It only takes a few seconds to pat it on, but it feels so luxurious to me to pat expensive water that immediately lightly plumps and hydrates my skin. It never broke me out and only left me with positive skin effects. It’s not a skincare must have, but I can’t say I won’t purchase this if I found it at a discount.

Thanks to Estée Lauder and Influenster for the chance to try this product!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,This worked for my skin! It went on smoothly and did not irritate my sensitive skin. I could see a difference in my skin tone for the better!
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Fantastic lotion,This line of products are just what your skin needs. You don't need to use a lot of it in order to feel it on your skin.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,I liked this product but was unsure how to incorporate it into my skincare routine. It states moisturizer but applies like a toner. I liked the way my skin felt using this product and it absorbed into the skin. I recieved a sample size to try and so am unsure how I would like this long term.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,Great product. Feels good on face. Lightweight. Not sure if it’s purpose but it felt lovely on my skin. It worked like a toner but felt more hydrating. I would recommend if you like using a toner.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,I love this product. It helps with hydration and my redness/roseaca. It works wonders and is not heavy or sticky feeling.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Nice addition to my skin care routine,"I put this on a freshly washed and dried face. In following the instructions, it states to put moisturizer on after this product. I let the product dry and felt residue that mixed into my moisturizer. Leaving a nice smooth feel. Initially putting it on, it's liquid like water but turns into a lotion. That's what confused me until I used the product. I do like the way my skin feels and will be adding this to my routine. #complimentary #Influenster #esteelauder"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Fat water feels good but doesn't do anything,"I did not see any improvement in my skin after using this daily for several weeks. I don't like the inconvenience of the extra step but would happily do it if it reduced the redness in my skin or improved the appearance of my pores. I have had better results with other products, so this wasn't a match for me."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,"This product is amazing, smoothes out your skin and gets it ready for your products. I was a bit weary about the product when I received it to test from Influenster because the product was very liquid but now it is part of my routine."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Not for me,Didnt notice any difference on my skin. I was hoping for it to work given the price. There are more affordable options out there.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Soothing and smoothing,This is a great serum. I received a sample to try and was really impressed with how it made my skin feel. I used it after my vitamin C and before my moisturizer. Would definitely consider repurchasing. It’s spendy- but the quality is there to support it.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Amazing,I loved this lotion because it was super moisturizing and didn’t leave my hands feeling oily. The scent was very pleasant and I enjoyed how it was long lasting.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Good but $$$$,This fragrance free toner is great at preparing the skin for treatment and hydration. The only fault is that it’s pricey while there’s plenty of affordable options available.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,nice but not necessary,My understanding of an essence is that they help your other products penetrate better. I have no idea if this does that. This is the second essence product I've tried and I've honestly seen no difference when using it. It's a nice product but not necessary in my skin care regimen.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,I really liked how moisturizing and calming this essence is. It absorbed easily and quickly. I don't think it should be so expensive
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Very hydrating.,I used this product after my face was clean and dry and splashed it on and allowed it to dry prior to my other skincare.  It is incredibly hydrating and absorbs into the skin really well.  I think it is a great product and feels good.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Hydrating but probably unnecessary,I enjoyed this product but I didn’t see much of a difference in my skin. It is very hydrating and didn’t leave my pores feeling tight. It is very light and I used it with my fingertips since it didn’t seem to go far when on a cotton pad.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Great for moisture,Great product very mositurizing. This is a product I will start using regularly in my skin routine.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,I love this Essence. It leaves my skin soft and ready for my skin regimen. I received a deluxe size sample so I was able to use for 2 weeks. I recommend this product and I will definitely buy this product to add to my skin care regimen. I have very oily skin and this essence did not make my skin oily and did not dry me out. It’s very moisturizing but not enough to bring my oils out. Great Product!!!
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,Not my favorite essence. Would have loved for it to be more hydrating
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Nothing special,"I suppose it’s a fine essence, but nothing special to warrant the high price point. It left my skin soft and didn’t irritate my sensitive skin, but nothing spectacular."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,No Estee Lauder's best work,"I received a sample size of this product from
Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange of my honest opinion.
I wasn't  fan of this product. It was a nice extra cleansing step but didn't seem to do much for my skin...
I would not buy a full size."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Meh,"Extremely watery, end up using more product with each use compared to other serums. It does seem to moisture but I did not notice any other immediate results."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,"I’m a huge advocate of essence in my skin care routine! I feel like it is such an important step for my serum to soak in. I’m obsessed with the fermented factor of this essence! It works really well for hydration. I noticed I can often skip my serum step when I use this product! My skin feels and looks so much healthier, plump, and vibrant! I love this Essence and highly recommend it!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Didn't work for me,Unfortunately I did not receive any benefits from this product.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Good Essence,"This bottle of essence is really good for skin that needs more moisture. It is a bit too pricey and doesn’t have the most evident results. However, it does make your skin a little more plump and moisturized than other essences. Also, it is not too thick nor is it too thin, so it feels really good when applied to your skin. Additionally, a little goes a long way, so one bottle will last a long time. I like to mix my toners and essences so I can apply a few at the same time, which extends the usage of a bottle even more. Furthermore, this essence is supposed to help you have smoother skin. I didn’t see any large changes to my skin’s texture after using this essence over a few weeks. All in all, you should get this essence if you want to splurge on something that will make your skin better by a little and feels good when you apply it. However, if you are looking for a fast-working product, this may not be it for you."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Skin like silk,I really loved how this made my skin feel. Silky soft and smooth and with no irritation . My skin can be fussy  with certain products and this didn’t break me out at all . Just soft touchable skin.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Pleasantly surprised!,"I have another treatment lotion from another brand that I really enjoy, so I figured this one would be about the same. It looks like this is my new fave! This made my skin so hydrated. I could tell the difference between other similar products that I've used. It made my makeup apply much easier, and my skin looked better. I'll definitely be purchasing a full size soon!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Refreshing and elegant,I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Estee Lauder for my honest review.  This was quite a nice product I enjoyed using it. It had a refreshing feel but I would not use it on sensitized skin. With the weather getting hotter it was really a nice addition to my skin care regimen.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Smoother Skin,"I applied the Micro Essence after cleansing skin, before moisturizer. What I have noticed most is that my skin feels smoother. It also helps my makeup go on better and look even."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,I’ve anyways been a skeptic of lotions because I never really understood what they did. When I received a deluxe sample of this (in exchange for my feedback) I was excited to finally see what it was about. It absorbed really well but I expected that since it’s watery. What I didn’t expect was how well it hydrated my skin on its own with no other products. I love that my other skincare went on and absorbed well without pilling (which unfortunately happens often with skincare). A little goes a long way-I learned that the hard way- so it has lasted me quite a long time. My skin didn’t feel tight later on in the day and my makeup looked great too.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,not for me,"this product wasn't for me.  I received it from Influenster and estee lauder for my honest review.  after using this for almost a month, I didn't notice any difference in my skin.  For the price point I expected atleast a small improvement."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,No noticeable difference,I'm not quite sure what rhis product is supposed to do but I did not notice any changes to my skin.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estee Lauder Micro Essence  Treatment Lotion,"I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes.  Also, to give my honest opinion.  I enjoyed trying this product.  At first, I noticed my skin having alittle redness and was stinging. But, that went away as the days went on.  When using this product, my skin is soft and have a brightness or glow to it.  I like how it make my face look moisturized.  I will continue to use this in my daily skincare routine because I want to continue to have that radiance look.  I recommend this to others to try."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Skins Feels Fresh,"This essence feels light and refreshing. I apply it after cleansing and a toner. It makes my skin feel fresh and moisturized. However I’ve not seen much difference in my skin. The fine lines are still there and I’ve been using this for a few weeks. 

I received this micro essence in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are strictly my own."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Great essence!,This essence was great. I used it after my cleanser. It was very hydrating. I used moisturizer after but I felt a difference as soon as I started using it.  My skin is smoother and slightly more firm!
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Review of Micro Essence,"I received this product complimentary for my honest review. I really liked this product! I incorporated this into my morning routine inplace of the toner that I normally use and I really like the results. My skin was more smooth and toned, and this is a product that I definitely would buy for myself!! I recommend this product to others to use ."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,"I received a complimentary deluxe sample of this product from Influenster. The sample last me a few weeks. All it takes is a couple drops. It's very lightweight and absorbs quickly. There is a very faint ""vinegar"" scent but it's hardly noticeable and doesn't linger. I really didn't notice much in the way of results. My skin was a little more hydrated and a touch softer. For the price point I was expecting more. If I could have used it longer I may have seen more results. If you have the money then go ahead and give it a try."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,"I received a complimentary trial bottle of this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I used the Micro Essence consistently for three weeks and did notice an improvement to my skin’s overall appearance — enough that I’ll likely buy the product despite its hefty price tag. My skin really did seem more hydrated and radiant. But, calling this a “lotion” is a bit misleading, as it’s a thin liquid that needs to be applied with a cotton ball or round."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Nice and soft,I must say I liked how my skin felt after applying. I noticed my skin was soft and smooth after applying. It was not sticky like most. I did notice my skin was not as dry throughout the day.  I will definitely add this to my routine.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,"I like this product. It is not oily, absorbs well, hydrating and refreshing to put on before bed and in the morning. Didn’t notice huge immediate results but long term my eyes are looking better and nose area. I would recommend."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,This is a great essence for oily or combo skin. I found that for my dehydrated skin it was not enough when just used with cerve moisture cream. But when added into my 10 step routine it added more hydration and brighter skin. I like it but would not repurchase due to liking other essences that work better for a lower price point. But it is a great product for being introduced to essences.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Love it,I love this Essence from Estee Lauder. I tried before and really like. I have dry skin and Essence is important in my face routine.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,Wonderful for dry skin. Refreshing and hydrating. Wish there was an easier way to apply. Definitely recommend.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,"I received a free sample from Influenster to try in exchange for my honest review. The bottle is very pretty. The treatment lotion is a gel like liquid. I ended up using a cotton pad to apply it. My first attempt of applying with my hands ended up a mess. I didn't realize how watery it is. I haven't noticed anything at all, after three weeks of twice a day usage. My pores and fine lines are still noticeable. It does absorb quickly and is not sticky. It is very expensive. I'm glad I tried it for free because I would not buy it."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,"I received a sample of this product through Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have been using Estée Lauder
Micro Essence Treatment Lotion with Bio-Ferment for three weeks now and love the way it makes my skin feel. My skin has been notiveably softer, smoother, brighter - and my fine lines are less noticeable. I've also noticed the redness in my skin becoming less noticeable as well. My makeup has applied like a dream since using it, which is an added bonus for sure.
While the price tag is a hefty one, I will certainly pick a bottle up when there's a gift with purchase offered!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,"So i received this product through influenster and ive been using it for a few weeks now. Ive noticed theres no red patches on my skin like there usually is near my nose. I feel more glowy looking, and no dry skin on my forehead. Will continue using"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,A luxurious addition to my skincare regimen,"I wasn't sure what to think about Estee Lauder Micro Essence treatment lotion when I received it. It doesn't seem like a lotion at all, as it has the consistency of a toner. It does, however, have a slightly silky feel and smoothes over my skin easily. My skin drinks it in instantly, leaving it look moisturized and somehow brighter. I enjoy how my skin looks and feels after using this product."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,Very moisturizing and hydrating. Helped fade my acne scars and reduced redness. Love it!
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,"This left my skin feeling very clean and soft. I used it after toner, before moisturizer. It's a nice light moisturizer essence. My skin is oily and this didn't make it worse. However, not sure I would repurchase at the price point, it's a little expensive for me and I don't love it over others I've tried that are more affordable."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,"So, so soft!",Skin felt softer and more moisturized after a couple of uses!
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Excellent base to your skin care regimen,"I received this complimentary sample for my honest review. 
I wish I had more. I use this 2x a day on clean skin morning and night. It’s allowed my skin to retain moisture throughout the day and I love that! 
It feels like water, so be careful pouring  it out or you may lose a lot of it"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Makes skin SO soft,"I received a deluxe sample of the @esteelauder Micro Essence from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The essence contains bio-active lactobacillus ferment and helps strengthen the skin’s barrier.  It’s a thin, watery consistency, and I didn’t expect it to do much, but I was really surprised. My skin felt super soft, smooth, and hydrated afterward and had a bit of a glow. You can layer this under serums or a moisturizer, but you almost don’t need anything after you apply this. Once again, Estee Lauder does not disappoint!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Calm,"I received this as a free sample from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really wasn't sure at first because of the texture of this essence. It seems very watery, however a little bit goes a long way to cover my face and neck. I could see smoother, softer skin and the redness that I normally have was gone by day 2. I do with that there was a spout to control how much comes out, but it really wasn't a problem. I love how calm and luxurious my face felt afterwards."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Great results,This stuff works miracles! My face has never felt so sift and smooth. It keeps the moisture in. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Works great for the face!!,This really helps me with reducing the appearance of my pore size.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Obsessed,"This treatment lotion does wonders at balancing and calming my skin. It's a watery toner consistency that I dispense in my hands and press into my skin. It absorbs quickly,there is no stickiness. Most importantly it does not aggravate/cause acne (does not react to any other skin care products I have either/layers well with other products). The pores on my upper cheeks area have shrank or tightened, I will be ordering a large bottle of this product."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Just ok,"I didn’t really see much of a difference in my pores when using this product, maybe it’s just not for me."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Noticeable Results,"The Estee Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion claims to lock in moisture, fight redness, and fortify the skin’s barrier. It has a watery consistency with a very faint fragrance. I apply just a couple of drops into my palms and lightly tap into my skin.  It dissipates very quickly and my skin immediately feels soothed and softer.  After using it twice daily for the past few weeks, it has definitely made a difference in how my skin looks and feels.  I’ve noticed my skin looks and feels healthier and more radiant, while my pores and fine lines seem minimized. I think it fits very well into my daily skincare regimen, and most likely will be purchasing in the near future."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,It’s okay,It’s alright. It wouldn’t be my holy grail product. I don’t notice a difference on days I use it vs days I don’t. It provides a little bit of smoothing under makeup. I’m so glad there is no fragrance!
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,"Great, lightweight lotion","I received this product for free from Influenster. The product is a liquid lotion that goes on smoothly, made my skin feel hydrated, and made my skin feel smooth. I would use this in the future, and my only complaint is I wish the sample size was larger!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,I was sent a travel sample size courtesy of Influenster for my honest review.  I used this product for 10 days before it ran out. It does feel smooth on the face. Does bring a hydrating feeling and a glowy effect to the face.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Nice product,"I received a free sample of this product and was skeptical at first due to the price of a full size bottle.  After using a small amount nightly before my nighttime moisturizer, I’m pleasantly surprised.  Let me tell you that just a little bit of this product goes a really long way and glides over my face very nicely.  It seems to help my moisturizer go on much smoother. The only reason I did not give 5 out of 5 rating was due to the price tag although I think a bottle should last you at least 6 months if not longer. I would recommend this product 100 percent."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Knows Best!,"When the G.O.A.T Estée Lauder comes
out with the Micro Essence Treatment
Lotion with Bio-Ferment you take notice.I
have used Estée Lauder for over twenty
years. years, the results have been great skin.
recommend to all ages to use the Micro
Essence Treatment Lotion with Bio-
Ferment to promote healthy, vibrant and
radiant skin."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Essence in a Bottle,I received this product in a Vix Nix from Influenster. I was able to test this product for some time to see the full effects. My skin is more smooth and hydrated. I have problem areas with super dry patches mainly around my nose and around corners of mouth. Those areas are more hydrated than usual allowing for a smoother more airbrushed finish to my foundation application.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Personal Review,"I received this product for review from influenster voxbox. I really liked this product,  it seemed over time to reduce the size of my pores, and my overall skin texture was much smoother.  I definitely will continue to use this product."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Supple skin is here,I received a sample size of this product and it has made such a difference in my skin. It made my skin soft and supple and improved the texture.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Pretty good!,"I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Ester Lauder for review with my honest feedback.

I’ve enjoyed this - it seems like it’s been good for my dry skin. I’ve found I reach for it in days I’m not wearing makeup since it helps tone down my redness and makes my skin feel smoother."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,It works!!,"5 stars, yup!!! The first time I used it my skin had a glow to it. You basically pat it in clean face with the palm of hand or use a puff ball. Automatically you can see a difference.  I got this as a sample for my honest review from Influenster.  My skin looks better and feels better! Thank you!!
Ice gotten many compliments on my skin after just a few days of using so I'd really reccomend to anyone just looking for a glow and for those fine lines to decrease ."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Good not great,"I received this product complementary in exchange for an honest review. This product is good, a lot of wonderful ingredients but if I’m paying that much I’d rather buy a from more skincare focused vs. makeup focused brand."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Nice product!,"This Estee Lauder Micro Essence is a very nice product. I put this on before my serum and moisturizer. This makes a moisture barrier on your skin, so your skin feels hydrated all day. It doesn't seem to have a scent. This is a very light liquid that absorbs quickly, and doesn't leave a sticky residue. I am impressed with this Estee Lauder Micro Essence. I recommend this product."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Not necessary,"I received a complimentary sample of this product from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. I used the Micro Essence Treatment Lotion for about a month and it didn't seem to do much overall. It has a watery but smooth consistency and has no scent. It absorbed quickly into my skin and almost felt like it wasn't even there but my skin was just a little more moisturized. It is a nice product but at the high price point, it's not a necessity. I would not purchase."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Stellar essence with no weird scent,"I received this product complimentary for review from influenster.  I've been using the Tatcha essence and when this was gone I started using pink drink, and my skin misses this product after one week of not using.  I'm definitely going to be adding this to my routine. I love that the full size has a pump, you can control how much you use.  With the travel size it had no plastic piece to slow down the essence coming out of the bottle.  This leaves my skin plumped,  hydrated, and I noticed some decrease in my hyper pigmentation. Again,  stellar pro6"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,It's okay,"I received the Estee LauderMiicro Essence Treatment Lotion with Bio-Ferment free for review. That in no way changes my honest opinion of this product.
First impression: the package in a nice heavy frosted glass bottle, but nothing special. There is absolutely no scent to the product what so ever, so if you are fragrance sensitive this would be a great option. It came with no directions for use. I understand this is a sample of the product, but I would have thought directions would have been printed on the bottle. If not, have an insert in the packaging explaining how to use this product.
This product is marketed as a ""lotion"" and it definately is not! It is like water! Infact the #1 ingredient is water. 
I will say that it did absorb very quickly into my skin without leaving any sort of heavy feeling or tacky-ness left behind. It also did seem to leave my skin looking hydrated.
Overall: for the price and consistancy of the product I would pass and reach for another moisturizer that I like much much better."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Fountain of Youth???,"I recieved this product from Influenster free and I’m so lucky I was chosen. It literally melted tears off my face. Almost 50 I am starting to experience fine lines and deeper wrinkles and this literally erased them. Great smell, goes on easy, absorbs nicely and quickly!! Run, RUN don’t walk to purchase this product!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,It’s ok,I received a sample sails of this product so it’s a little hard to tell how much it would improve your skin I have this super dry place under my chin and I did see some improvement in that spot
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estée Lauder Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment - 200ml,"Another must have from this brand! Safe at night, the never morning soon is sit, hydrated, with fine lines looking filled in. Soft fragrance. Given for review from Influenster. Definitely recommend for you skin care regimen."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Skin feels smoother,This product feels just like water it has no oily residue it has no scent but yet it makes my skin feel very smooth I would definitely recommend this product
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,My new fav product form Estee,"I supposed to receive a complementary product to review but it never made it to me. But by being a loyal Estée Lauder customer, I went to my favorite department store and purchased the smallest product. The bottle is very pleasant to handle, the product is not sticky, very nice liquid with low odor. After winter my skin was thirsty and needed a good hydration and this Micro Essence did a fantastic job - the light texture is pleasant to use and I feel how my slightly dry and dull skin absorbed this nectar. The skin looks rested and refreshed. I like the ingredients and I trust Ester’s quality. It was a perfect addition to my routine (to the rest of Estee collection of the moisturizing care) and I am planning to continue using the Micro Essence from Estee since now on."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Estee Lauder,I think this product does well. But I don't think it's worth the price. The sample I had gotten was through influenster.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Beautiful,"This is a really elegant product that’s effective but not at all irritating. It adds tons of moisture, and sort of works as a hybrid toner-serum. I still used a moisturizer after, but I felt softer and dewier. I don’t know if I’d call it essential, but it was a lovely addition to my routine."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,"Smooth and hydrating, the perfect first step!","I received this sample complimentary for review from Influenster. I just do love this essence, I have been using it daily since I received one month ago and I will be purchasing a replacement. I have noticed a change in the texture of my skin, I believe due to its hydrating properties as well as priming the skin for my other skincare products. This is the most important I believe,  the ""priming"" of the face, it has affected the way my other skincare absorbs into my skin. I haven't changed anything in my routine other than adding this step, and a positive difference is noted. I only gave 4 stars due to the price tag but otherwise it is a luxurious staple to have in your routine. My skin is softer and less textured. A small amount goes a long way, just tipping bottle onto fingers is the best way to use the least amount of product. I recommend!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Nice essence,"I’ve used similar essences from Tatcha and Sulwasoo. Like this product, they are made in Japan where they are much more strict about the quality and purity of ingredients. This is similar. It has a watery consistency and has a bit of slip to it. It dries down non tacky. It’s aim is to soothe and hydrate your skin in preparation for serums and moisturizers. My sample was too small for me to notice a difference. I will say the pinkness in my cheeks from retinol use toned down with use - but I can’t be certain if the other claims. The ingredients are good."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Fantastic,This product was absolutely fantastic. It not only made my skin feel hydrated but have me a nice pump look which instantly made me look less tired.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Very Hydrating!,"This is a five star product. First I love that it does not have a strong fragrance! It barely has a scent at all. Second, my face feels very hydrated and it has reduced the redness I often experience. I plan to continue to use this product! This hydrated my face without leaving it greasy feeling. It was so easy to apply. I did use a cotton ball to apply."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Just ok,I honestly do not it is anything extraordinary.  Especially for the price. It felt like a toner. I did not see any change in pore size or wrinkles. I recieved a sample from Influenster.  I would not purchase this for what it claims to do.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Treatment Lotion With Bio-Ferment,USA,Saw no difference.,I usually love Estee Lauder products but this one is a miss for me. I used itt for a couple of weeks but didn't really see a difference in my skin. I will go back to using my normal skin routine.
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,renews my skin,Im still waiting for the result to kick in but so far so good. It peels of my skin gently and renews new cell. It gives me extra glow and removes dead skin..
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,good but can be too harsh ,i use it to treat certain discoloured parts of my body and it actually works! well not too much of change after a week but there’s a change and it was obvious after about 2 weeks. but it can be bit too harsh on skin so i only use it once in 3 days. used it everyday for a week and it kinda give me an uncomfortable feeling on the area. i might buy something with lower percentage of glycolic acid. 
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,good,"Wish I’ve discovered this earlier honestly!! I’ve tried tons of toners ranging from $10+ to $60+. Honestly this is one of the best, I’ve been getting compliments on my skin ever since using this. And at this price it’s really value for money "
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,works well,"I’ve been using this for around two weeks, every other night (as advised on the bottle( and the dry skin that I’ve been struggling to get rid of for months now has finally gone! Very pleased with this product and would recommend for anyone with dry patches of skin! It’s probably worth noting that this product states it sensitises skin to the sun and uv, so you can only really use it at night (not as a primer as one negative review has mentioned?!) other than this I can’t fault the product and I’ll be continuing to use it!"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Perfection,"Great affordable product that actually works! 
Another Inkey List product that is better than more expensive brands. Simple and easy to use, very highly recommended. Will purchase again and again."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Glycolic toner,"Ok toner does what it needs to, was not life-changing didnt see any results with acne or texture"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,too strong ,I have sensitive skin so the product wasn’t the right match for me. The acid did make my skin soft but it left behind a burning sensation. It was also very drying and make my skin flaky. 
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Skincare staple,"Toner is an essential in skincare and the Inkey's glycolic acid toner is a great addition to my regime! Glycolic acid is an AHA acid, meaning that it targets the surface of the skin - pore size, blemishes, sebaceous filaments, blackheads, dry/flaky skin, rough patches, and areas of hyperpigmentation. You can use this toner anywhere on the body, not just your face! I recommend applying this with a serum dropper instead of a cotton pad to avoid wasting product."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,holyyy,"Clean-excellently! I will definitely repurchase, like always via Sephora the cheapest compare to other platform... It is very important to use skincare so that our face will forever beautiful"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Basic Toner,"This product reminds me of the toners available decades ago that burnt your skin. Expensive for the amount that you receive considering it’s a budget product. My skin was still stinging five minutes after using. 
The Ordinary acid toner is superior product in every way
"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Miss,"I just bought this to try and know if it's hit or miss. I am not sure if I like it or hate it. So it's 50/50. 
It's not expensive so if you want to try, go for it."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Surprisingly I really like this,I have repurchased this and it is so good. I thought it wouldn’t be a good exfoliant but it tally makes a difference in my skin. It gives a slight tingle but does not irritate. My skin feels smoother 
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,great product,A gentle cleanser that is effective and affordable. Has worked wonders along with PC 2% bha exfoliant to clear my skin and unclog stubborn pores. Would definitely purchase again
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,New Zealand,Works wonders,"This product has really helped to make my skin appear more smoother. I have noticed the small surface bumps have been reduced, and i am less prone to breaking out."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,New Zealand,YES PLEASE,"I bought this because I have hyperpigmentation. When I tell you to go buy this right now, I MEAN GO BUY IT RIGHT NOW. I was so conscious about the dark spots and I hate wearing makeup to hide my skin. I feel like I can confidently walk out of the house without makeup."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,aditi,This is genuinely good stuff for pores. Must recommend. I have been using this from 2 months and can see the results. It works slow but works definitely.
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,perfect ,"Perfect addition to your skin care regime. This  is a lovely product. Not overpowering in smell, but effective. I would recommend this product for the price point. Love xx"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,New Zealand,Cheap toner but there are better out there!,"This toner felt really nice and hydrating however, I’m not really sure if it did anything for my skin such as helping my pores as it claims. I’ve only been using for a week though so maybe it just needs more time! :) Really good for the price though! "
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,New Zealand,Not great,Its a nice glycolic acid toner but very plain and harsh on the skin. I prefer the Paulas choice salicylic acid toner for exfoliation because its a little bit gentler
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,New Zealand,small size,ok toner to loosen dead skin and brighten complexion. It's only 100mls so it's kind of pricey compared to other inkey products and other brands are cheaper. Wish they had a larger value size bottle. 
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,pleased with this,Works great - noticing more evenness in my skin tone.
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,good ,"Wow. Just wow. I’ve had Natasha Denona products before and have mostly been pleased. But this blew me away. Likely my most favourite from her so far. It is the most beautiful glow, it made my skin look like that of a poreless goddess. I’m quite pale but with yellow undertones. I got the light medium just because it looked prettiest from the swatches even though I would usually go for the lightest in these kinds of things, I’m very pleased I did."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,glycolic toner ,"It’s perfect size toner, I normally use a different brand but when that brand is out of stock, this is my next alternative. It’s also a perfect travel size bottle and convenient.
"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Great Toner,Great toner at an affordable price.  It can be great for gradual exgoliation of dead skin cells.  Good for wide pores and wrinkles and can smoothen out the skin.  
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,great for my oily acne skin ,I have oily skin and I’ve been using this a few times a week at my night skincare and I really enjoy it. I’ve been using it for a while now even with other brands and this is one of my favourite. 
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,New Zealand,Great Product,"Really great product! I saw it working after my first time using it, I will definitely buy again! I told my friends about it and they all loved it too!
"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,alright ,ok. does the job. I didn't like that it's wayyy too watery compared to other toners I've used in the past. and I didn't love the witch hazel ingredient in there. bought this to try cos it was reasonably priced but I won't be buying again when this finishes. 
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,LOVE LOVE LOVE,this is the way to go if you’re wanting to try milk products but don’t want to commit to fullsize and it is great I would definitely recommend the minis are so cute
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,miss,Great price point for a glycolic toner although I must say that I could not use more than once a week as it irritated my skin around the nose and mouth area. I have used better acid products that I could incorporate to my routine 2-3 x weekly. The smell is another factor on why I will not be ready purchasing 
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,The Inkey List Glycolic Acid Toner,This is just alright.  It works pretty well I guess but I couldn't stand the fact that it smells like actual tequila.  Disgusting.
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Philippines,Great for my Face,This was my first product i've used to exfoliate and it feels nice. Though on my first week of using it i have a stinging feeling on my face but it didn't last long. My acne got worse on the 2nd week of using but continue using and now my acne almost and maybe because of the additional products i've used. I used it thrice a week.  
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Not bad ,"Not bad product, although can’t see much effect. Can be used as a daily evening treatment as it doesn’t make skin dry, but nicely fresh. Can consider buying again."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Philippines,effective,"This doesnt sting unlike other toners. This is mild but is really effective. Considering the price point, it is worth the money. It didnt breaks me out so i think i will repurchase it."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Effective,"This product helps treat the skin by helping it to smooth out texture on the skin (exfoliation), removes redness and existing blemishes. 

I use this during the evening time and apply it it to my skin every other night. A little goes a long way. 

I use this product before applying another treatment on my skin in the evening time. 

Definitely worth the purchase!"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,miss ,I’ve only been using this for a week - so far it’s ok. I have acne prone skin and it is quite drying. Will use for a bit longer before I decide whether or not I’ll re buy
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,Effective,"I'm a season AHA/BHA user but this is really strong. It does sting my skin a little, so people with sensitive skin should start slow with this."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,The Inkey List Glycolic Acid Toner,Excelente producto para pieles grasa o con tendencia a acné.
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Esta bien,"La primera vez que compre este producto en 2020 me encantó, tenía un toque al final de escualeno que me gustaba y luego compré otro y no me dio la misma sensación, no se si cambiaron algo. Aunque tengo piel grasa me gustaba el toque de escualeno ya que me mantenía un poco más hidratada en la noche."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Meh,"This product was okay, I don't think i'll be buying it again. I did in fact give this to a friend with oily skin. As I have very sensitive and combination skin. I did not enjoy this, my face burned every time I even touched it on my face for a few seconds. This would go on for about 5-10ish minutes after settling in and moisturizer. I don't think it made a difference after two weeks either."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,glycolic acid toner,"great exfoliant, good results within consistent use, i use this once or twice a week n get good results, totally recommend to ppl if the bha is not for them"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,For multipurpose use,"I purchased this product because I was looking for a higher concentrated glycolic acid. I made a mist spray out of it with pineapple and papaya extract for extra natural exfoliation.  I love this product because it has helped to reduce my ingrown hair and razor bumps in less than a week. I also use this as a natural deodorant as it helps to kill the bacteria that causes body odor. Lastly, I use this on my face as a toner. It cleared up my clogged pores and brightened my skin tone. I like this brand because it doesn’t leave a sticky residue on my skin when I use it. The only thing is, I wish that they had a larger version of this because I use it pretty often."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Fantastic & Inexpensive,Great product that goes to show quality doesn’t have to cost an arm and a leg. 4 stars not 5 for me because I do find it stings for a few seconds every time I use it. Will purchase again. 
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Miss,I heard really great things about this product but if you have sensitive skin like me I would suggest being careful using this product. Other chemicals exfoliants I’ve tried on my face have been okay but this one burned.
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,mrs,"Feels nice in face, will use daily. Hopefully my skin will be healthy. Feels nice in face, will use daily. Hopefully my skin will be healthy. Feels nice in face, will use daily. Hopefully my skin will be healthy."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,was not right for my skin type.,silly enough i ordered a glycolic acid without knowing the science behind it and soon realised it was abit harsh on my skin as i have a dry and blemish-prone skin type. although i would still recommend this to anyone who struggles with oiliness and won’t be as harsh on their skin! X
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Great! ,"This product arrived to us having leaked but Sephora customer care sorted the problem out straight away with care & efficiency. As my experience with a few of the Inkey List products, perhaps the packaging could be looked at on their end. I purchased this for my hubby & he loves it. I can see a big difference to his pores and general skin texture with just a couple of weeks of use. Can’t wait to try it myself. "
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Skin Saver,"I honestly love this stuff so much. Since using this, my skins texture is so much smoother than before. Most of the little bumps I get are gone. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't irritate it at all. I will definitely be repurchasing. So happy I bought this product!! "
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia, works great,I have texture skin. After using the product for about 2 weeks I've seen my skin improve. 
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,New Zealand,Great Value,"Great toner, my normal skin has been so much brighter since using this. 
Product can sting for a few seconds if you have any cuts, blemishes or sensitive skin."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Affrodable skincare ,This brand is my absolute favourite when it comes to skincare! i cannot underestimate the effectiveness and ease this brand is to use and the results are great abs an affordable brand to use. 
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,love it ,"I had fungal acne, I tried a lot skincare but seems like not effective on my skin. But this 1 is working so good on my skin.. I just applied for 2 weeks and can see the difference. Will be purchase again"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,great for acne,"I use this 1-2 times every week on my face and I have seen impressive results. Glowing skin, less texture and has helped with my forward acne tremendously. However, if u are someone with sensitive skin, be careful to not use/overuse this product as it may be irritating and burn the skin :)"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,It worked for me! following up with some lactic,"Really worked for my skin concerns at that moment. Having some medium size hard bumps around chin due to close to period time and frequency of wearing masks. I had couple times bumps like this before but was like 1 or 2. This time was 6 or 7 of them around my right side chin and did made me worried about it!
So I went to the store in person and talked with one of the beauty adviser showed her my face for few seconds. She was wearing mask, very kind asked me to do describe how the bumps and the texture, and then asked me if it’s okay for me to show her how the bumps it look like. I showed mine couple seconds. she advices me about this brand was coming from ordinary. Help me to build some trust with this new brand for my first time try and I am very glad the first time I use this and following up with ordinary’s Lactic serum worked!
One use the hard bumps went down and reduced size; I try to use it at night time and every other night. Remember to protect your skin with some type of sunscreen after start using these treatment.
I will go back to the store and tell her that I’m glad we talked and these works for my skin!"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Strong formula ,"This toner is strong! I wouldn’t use more than once or twice a week - with more frequent use it gave me breakouts & congestion
Make sure to hydrate your skin alot after use"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,amazing!,"I started by using it once or twice a week as it can be harsh at first, and now I use it every second day, sharing with another gentle toner. It works very well and has helped with my pimples and oily T zone especially! Highly recommend this product and brand overall!!! "
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,Sensitive Skin BEWARE!,"I have been using acids and chemical exfoliators for a while now, but when i used this, it just stung my skin pretty badly! Tried to layer products before this but did not work. Multiple tries but my skin still hated it! "
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Stings on the face,"Was very excited for this product as I read the description. I never had any problems with any products, even if it had fragrance or all sorts of chemicals, I have no allergies and my skin is a combination of dry and oily skin. My skin isn’t the sensitive type either, but this product hurt my face a lot. It stung everywhere and it was itchy. It looked very promising, but it didn’t work for me. I only used it once. Will never again buy it. Sorry ;/"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,not bad for the price,Wanted to try out this brand. It was inexpensive and I felt it did the job. I have sensitive skin and my skin responded well to this toner. Does the job 
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,MIGHTY.,"Powerful. Clears bumps and pores. More so than PC BHA 2%, imho. I limit use T-Zone and I often rinse it off depending on my skin’s condition . With a pad or towel you can swipe flakes. A hydrating version would be a blessing, perhaps with Squalane.   I took one star off because the product could be more hydrating and  because it could use a tad more product volume."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Fade my dark spots ,Love it even though my 1st purchase of this and it worked wonder for me...After using 3 weeks I noticed my dark spots on my face faced and my hyperpigmentation also  less visible..I have sensitive skin but it's doesn't not irritated ..Really nice texture...Love it 💋
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,The Inkey List Glycolic Acid Toner,This toner is what you pay for. It is helping my pores unclog a bit. Stings on my acne but most toners do anyways
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,New Zealand,Go-to Toner,This toner exceeds expectations. Reasonably priced and sloughs off the dirt off my face. Very much evident when I look at the cotton pad I use. I consider this a really great buy!
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Best treatment toner,"Glycolic are best for all skin types and very suitable for sensitive skin.
It smoothen my skin and my pores have shrink after 2 weeks of using.
Makes sure to use hydrating toner after.

"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,lots of alcohol ,"Had so many expectations for this product and could not use it at all. 
For starters, the package came with what felt like sugar dripping from the bottle, which I didn’t really mind but once I put it on my face it felt extremely strong and could even smell the alcohol mixed with some kind of sugary stuff on my face.
After a few seconds I was a little blushed (I do not have sensitive skin) and my face was stinging to the point I had to wash my face .

I have the product couple chances more but the same thing happened. Would definitely not recommend this for sensitive skin people or conscious of alcohol as an ingredient for their skincare products "
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,nice product,"nice toner for daily use. it is on par with the glycolic acid toner from the ordinary imho. not too stripping, but good as a first step skin prep prior to other skincare. "
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,ITEM RECEIVED DAMAGED,"Item received damaged. Sephora Malaysia, Reported to customer service but no action taken. Hence, -1 star given due to this. Im gonna buy from other platform after this. "
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,toner,Very very very good product. Really like it . Cheap and very effective. I use this brand for skin care routine and is it really nice . Great texture and also skin feels shiny
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,The Inkey List Glycolic Acid Toner,"An employee recommended this because they were all out of the ordinary glycolic toner. All I have to say, WOW! I’ve only used it about 3/4 times and the texture on my forehead has already smoothed out!! Only downside I have is it does burn/sting just a little bit when I first tried it, and I don’t have sensitive skin either. Other than that, this toner is amazing!!"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Will never live without this product.,This has changed my skincare game completely. I have combo/oily skin and struggle occasionally with clogged pores. This stuff is a must; it gets all the debris out that my Clarisonic may have missed and really leaves my skin feeling super clean and fresh. Stings a little but that is normal. I use it every other night (use retinol in between) and it is amazeballs.
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Broke me out,"I have semi-sensitive skin and have tried this a few times but it does not react well with my skin. They say that purging is part of introducing chemical exfoliants but this was something else- every few days another under-the-skin sore blemish would pop up, and it kept happening even after a few weeks. Not just normal skin purging. Really disappointed, this made my skin worse than it was before I started using it "
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Add this to your skincare routine!!,"This removed the texture from the center of my forehead when nothing else could. And it is such a great price!! Perfect for gentle, daily exfoliation"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,perfect ,I use this as toner after washing my face. Works wonders for my acne prone skin. It is a must product in my routine. It faded away my acne scars and oiliness from my face.
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,loveeee,this is the cheapest glycolic acid you can get. the formulation is great same as the TO glycolic acid toner. i also apply it on my underarm and neck..
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Very Good.,"My favourite toner by far, the Inkey List and has been a cult favourite of mine now for quite some time. It tingles when you put it on, until your skin gets used to it. Helps my acne prone skin so much. I put it on at night with the rest of my skincare, and wake up with less pimples & not so visible pores the next day. Absolutely great!"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Makeup Artist’s Review:,"Literally the best toner I’ve ever used on myself or any clients!! It’s made my skin so much more smooth, and really helps in the prevention of breakouts :)"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,ok ok,"The product was ok ok. Couldnt really see much  difference probably because i was not really consistent using it. But i have heard so many good reviews about it which made me buy the product instantly and it was said to have instant result which i would not agree to.

Overall the product is good and you cn purchase if you are consistent on your skincare routine
"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,favourite toner ,at such a great price this toner is definitely the most reliable and useful product in my skincare routine. cleared my skin and minimal irritation considering the high acidity of the product. 
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,so far so good,Toner doesnt give any burning sensation and keeps my skin clean. Feels like my skin is more clean and tomed after cleansing my face. A good product. Would definitely recommend this 
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,A+,"When I start to get little breakouts or any skin problems this toner works like magic…
I don’t know how but it helps balance everything out and makes my skin right again…
Another Inkey product that will be a regular repurchase in my skincare and I highly recommended "
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,exfoliate toner,"just used this product for 2 days, feeling tingling sensation after applying it on skin every afternoon, but the skin looks brighter after appplying it."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,toner ,The glycolic acid toner from the inkey list helped with my acne and blackhead I’ve been using it for a few weeks and definitely see a difference. Would recommend it also very affordable 
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Not suitable for my skin,"my skin is dry, everytime using this will feel the burning sensation on my skin, I use it 2weeks once as it is too irritate to my skin. I will no purchase again"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,New Zealand,Awesome ,"Another awesome product from the inkey list!! L9ve the simplicity of this brand.. This toner is a holy frail for me, just wish they sold this in a bigger bottle/size"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Better and stronger than others,"After trying a few other toners, I will definitely be re-ordering this. On the first go, it does sting quite a bit but I’d imagine that’s because my skin wasn’t used to it. I used this every night as a part of my PM routine and I would definitely recommend that others use it too if you have acne prone, combination skin. "
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,effective glycolic,"After I finish the one bottle of this toner, i notice that it evens out my face, lighten my acne scars and prevent me from having pimples. I will surely recommend this to those who has the same skin condition as i do."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,THIS IS MY FAVORITE PRODUCT EVER,my skin is really sensitive but i have a lot of dead skin i was scared to try an acid toner but it doesn't irritate my skin and leaves my skin feeling so soft
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Worked great for me.,Love it I’ve used 3 bottles of this and it worked wonders for me. I don’t have sensitive skin so it didn’t irritate my skin and actually helped fade some of my post acne pigmentation.
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,big fan ,"I use this for my under arms and knees and elbow. 
It does work, wish it came in a bigger bottle . 
Would definitely repurchase it. Value for money . 
"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,nice toner ,"Only used it at night, although it leaves my face red for awhile but it does clear a little of the dead cells. But it could be a little stingy especially the area with acnes "
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,New Zealand,I like it! ,"This is the first Glycolic Acid I have purchased, and I probably dove in to using it frequently, a little fast 😅  so I have had some redness and its definitely bringing forth all the crap that's been hiding in my skin and I've been getting a few spots... they are clearing quickly however! I use it at night, and use another toner in the morning. My pores appear to be smaller, my skin tone appears more even (aside from the redness). I also use it on other areas of my body where I have built up skin and blemishes (around my arm pits) and my skin has remarkably cleared up in those other areas! 
I am considering buying a mask to use along side this in my more problem areas to see if I have a better result. 
I would buy again! "
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,it’s good!! ,Been using this for about a month and so far it did great in smoothing my textured skin! Really love this and i would consider to repurchase as it is affordable and effective
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,New Zealand,nice toner,"this toner is pretty alright. as it’s an acid toner it tends to sting a bit, so i would avoid using it on any acne or broken skin as it will burn. but this product makes my skin feel very soft and smooth. i recommend it if you don’t suffer from acne too much"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Small for a 100ml ,"I’ve not try it yet but the size is quite smaller than my usual 100ml’s purchase. I had few dead skin due to acne scars now, so i hope this toner could help me!"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,New Zealand,glycolic toner,Love the inkey lists glycolic acid toner! It does what it says and for he price I’m not complaining. I use it every other night and it has made a difference. Will be purchasing it again!
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Great for the price,"As with all IL products, this is a great exfoliant for the price. Works well, keeps skin glowy and no-fuss formula. "
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,love itt,"Really good, my face cleared up heaps after this. It does sting alittle so wouldn’t recommend for sensitive skin but its great for oily skinned people :)"
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Australia,Good value ,"I love the sting when applying this. Don’t think it is quite as good as the tarte one, but is a lot cheaper. Still pretty effective and the smell isn’t super strong either."
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Philippines,nice,The inkey list glycolic acid toner is okay. The bottle is not that big nor small and i think price is reasonable. I would probably buy again because i love that the inkey list is a vegan and a cruelty free and it is so effective.
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Don’t Buy If You Have Sensitive Skin!,"I wanted to make this product work for me since it had such great reviews but I underestimated how sensitive my skin is.

Every use gave a stinging sensation, and then I’d have red splotches afterwards. I think it caused me to break out some too so be careful if you have sensitive skin! Good thing the price isn’t too bad but definitely didn’t work for me :("
THE INKEY LIST-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Effective immediately on clogged pores,"I love this product and alternate it with my BHA liquid from Paulas choice on my AHA BHA nights. ( I alternate every other night with retinol, AHA/BHA, with a break or two in between the two) It works great as what I believe is a member of the AHA family. I have blackheads, and clogged pores and I can feel and see this work its magic pretty quickly. I wouldve given 5 stars, but it is such a small size, I feel like they should offer a more full size product? I wouldnt mind if it cost more too. After this one is done I will be trying the Ordinary's glycolic toner as it is bigger and almost same price. If it works as great I will stick with that, but if not I will easily come back to this one. I just think its wasteful to have to go through more smaller bottles more frequently."

The range works on minimising and hydrating my skin - which answers my skin target concerns.

CAUDALIE-Vinopure Clear Skin Purifying Toner,Australia,Nothing helpful,I'm oily to combination skin. I actually don't use a toner very often as I feel like serum and moistuiser is enough. This product did not help a lot for my skin condition. But probably I would use this in summer only.

CAUDALIE-Vinopure Clear Skin Purifying Toner,Singapore,Great for hormonal acne,"I’m on day 3 of using this. The morning after the first use my minor hormonal acne on my chin was massively reduced! My pores were instantly less visible, too.
The only thing I’ll mention is that it is quite drying so my skin seems to be a little oily a few hours after use as it may be over-compensating. My skin is on the oily side though. Follow it up with a hyaluronic acid and a moisturizer and you should see good results."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Clear Skin Purifying Toner,Australia,Mrs,"Really great product.
I’ve struggled to find a toner that isn’t too “harsh” on my skin - it’s very gentle and doesn’t feel like it’s stripping the skin."

CAUDALIE-Vinopure Clear Skin Purifying Toner,Singapore,Acne prone skin toner ,"First of all, good price point good volume. After swapping out my old toner to using this, HUGGGGGE difference in my skin. Less oily! Less clog! Bonus! Lesser pimples. Their cleanser (same range) with serum is a great combination for acne prone. Once’s your pimple started to lessen, it’s time to change to other toner. As it’s can drying for normal skin."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Clear Skin Purifying Toner,Malaysia,Caudalie,Not my favourite toner. I have been applying this toner for a week plus and it does little change to my face. The price is reasonable though for a 200ml bottle. 
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Clear Skin Purifying Toner,Singapore,"Good product, helped to control my hormonal breakout","I bought this together with the range of other products in the vinopure range. I received a sample of this toner when I had a hormonal breakout in my 40s and have used many other products to no avail. I love the minty smell of this toner, it's watery and light, the only gripe I have is that it has a slight soapy consistency when you apply it to your face, I find that with this product, less is more. I prefer to use a cotton pad to apply rather than hands so that I can wipe, then use whatever that's left on the cotton pad to rest on those breakouts that are still active to soak in more. Although this product has salicylic acid, it's formulation does not dry out my skin, in fact it miraculously reduced the redness on my normally sensitive skin. Overall, I'm happy that this toner calms sensitive breakout prone skin."
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Clear Skin Purifying Toner,Malaysia,Caudalie  vinopure clear skin purifying toner ,"I love it because it's CLEAN BRAND! But other than that, of course their products was really effective and show result. Was looking for best toner that can give a clean skin + it's also help to minimise pore. it's doesn't feel dry at all after use it. I like it the most is feeling minty colling sensation because it's have peppermint sense. overall I definitely will recommend other to try it! "
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Clear Skin Purifying Toner,Malaysia,Awesome,"Love this toner, made my skin feels clean. It able to pick up the excess dirt on my skin after few wipes with cotton pad. My whiteheads are lesser now. A little goes a long way, worth for money. Definitely will repurchase!"

CAUDALIE-Vinopure Clear Skin Purifying Toner,Singapore,purifying toner ,A very normal toner that gets the job done in a fuss free manner. Can be very soapy on the face if u pour a little too much toner on ur cotton pads or hands during application 
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Clear Skin Purifying Toner,Singapore,Will repurchase again ,It helps to clean my pores but I will only use this at night because it might be too strong for your skin if you use this day & night.

He has oily skin, large pores and occasional breakouts. I believe the toner is the best item in his skincare routine. I’m actually jealous how much it has cleared up his skin and evened out his tone. One star off for the fact that Claudalie still sells to stores in China where animal testing is required."

CAUDALIE-Vinopure Clear Skin Purifying Toner,Philippines,Good Workhorse Toner for the Toner-phobic,"Good toner—in fact, the only one I use. Gentle enough for flare-ups and sensitive skin, but potent enough to deep-clean and even out my complexion. Even helps remove dead skin, which is oh-so-satisfying. It's also pretty light, not sticky, and smells fresh. The clean formula is a big plus too—Caudalie gets that right every time. Honestly, was not a fan of using toners, but this one gets my approval. Have bought several bottles over the years. (Tip: use a small amount or else it starts to feel a little soapy and doesn't work as well.)"

CAUDALIE-Vinopure Clear Skin Purifying Toner,Malaysia,Worth every penny!!!,"I have oily and acne-prone skin and this has worked wonders! The beauty of this product is that you don't have to put a lot of toner on the cotton pad. The size of the smallest penny is more than enough because as you run the cotton pad along your face, the product will spread even more on the cotton pad than its initial 'penny size'. It leaves behind a really nice smell and skin feels bouncy after. I only use it at night though since it has facial oils in it as well. A great product!!!"
CAUDALIE-Vinopure Clear Skin Purifying Toner,Canada,Controls oils,This is my go to toner. It helps to control my oily skin so that I don’t look greasy but still have a natural glow. I’ve stopped using cotton rounds and just put a few drops in my palm then rub and pat onto my face.

I used a TINY sample that I got with an order, and the amount just in that tiny tiny bottle was enough usages to ruin my skin barrier. Are you people using this everyday??? I used this once a day for a week and now it hurts to put on cerave lotion if that tells you anything. If you have even remotely dry skin I would sprint in the other direction. The smell is perfect if you are a preteen and the year is like 1995 but other than that, it's a miss for me."

GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner,USA,Sickly sweet smell,Very small quantity for the price. The smell is sickly sweet and unbearable. It leaves the skin sticky afterwards. I used for over a week and saw no results.

GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner,Canada,Glad I got the mini first,"after using up this whole bottle during travels, i don't get the hype of this brand/product. I didn't feel like it did anything to my face (so i guess it's good that it didn't damage it at least?), the bottle is glass so heavy to carry around (if it's a mini chances are you'll travel with it), and I found the spout imprecise to use since i couldn't squeeze for more at a time. All in all it served its purpose during travels but I won't terrorist in full size as it's not worth it imo"

GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner,USA,"wanted to love, but it’s just okay","so I love this toner because it lasts forever (8 months of daily use, and I still have a quarter left!) and it hydrates my skin! It didn’t break me out or have a negative impact on my skin.  
It just hasn’t done anything for my pores or my acne, and it doesn’t make my skin very glowy after it’s dried down. 
I have combo acne prone skin and this isn’t doing much for me, so I won’t be repurchasing. I think if you have dry or normal skin this will work better for you!"

The scent might be a bit much for some, but I don't mind it. I also like the consistency of this toner.  I will say I have noticed my blackheads don't seem as prominent even though they are still there.  I have noticed my skin looking clearer. Even though I have combination skin, this toner doesn't over-dry or irritate my dry zones.  I would say to gradually work up to using it daily if you have sensitive skin or it could  get too intense."
GLOW RECIPE-Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner,USA,Obsessed must have,"Im obsessed with this toner. It leaves my skin so soft and clear. When I first started it did make my skin purge and I was so scared but after I got past it my skin has never looked better. a must in my skin care routine, i only use it at night so can't say how it is day and night."

FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,Australia,One of the best toners I’ve ever used,"WOW WOW WOW. I have a dry to combo skin and throughout winter, my eczema flared up so many times. After the first week of using this, I noticed my skin was SUPER moisturised, smoother, glossy and ALL my eczema was gone. Definitely repurchasing
"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,New Zealand,Great at night ,"Super hydrating and after using it nightly for a week, my skin is still hydrated and plump when I wake up. Super gentle on sensitive skin and soothing on eczema  "
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,Malaysia,the best! ,"i love this toner! it’s milky but it doesn’t leave my skin the sticky and icky feelings, but very smooth and subtle. some are kinda turned off with the smell but it’s not that bad to compare it with the experience/feelings on my face. will defo buy it again! "
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,New Zealand,Fresh feel,This is product is a very thin liquid but feels refreshing on the skin and doesn’t leave a sticky after-feel. It has a mild fragrance which I like. It has a really soft feel to it. I interchange it with the original fat water. I use this one with my night routine. 
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,New Zealand,Disappointing ,"I really wanted to love this product, however as someone who only usually gets the odd small breakout from time to time I noticed I started getting really bad breakouts. Took me a while to realise it was this product after discovering they put coconut oil in the formula - one of the most comedogenic oils out there (rated a 4 on the comedogenic scale with 0 being the most non-comedogenic). This was disappointing as you would think whoever creates these formulas would be knowledgeable enough to use a less comedogenic oil in it. Anyway while it does feel nice and hydrating it really upset my skin and now have to give it away as I’ve stopped using it. I would use the original
Fat water in the future maybe but be careful with this formula "
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,Canada,not for me,"not for me, the smell was a bit too off for me, while cool the twist bottle didn’t work & it was a bit too creamy for my skin & left it a bit too oily. i prefer the kombucha essence by dr ceuracle which is a nicer milky toner"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,"Not bad, but there are better alternatives","I received this product in a free sample program. After using this product 2x a day for 2 months, I can say that I did not see significant changes in my skin. I did notice that after using this toner my skin would feel slightly more hydrated but it would not last / provide continued hydration like I hoped it would. The fragrance in this product is also extremely strong which I found to be irritating though I know others may not mind. Overall I would say there are other products with a more affordable price point which would provide the same or even better results."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,Australia,Yes!!!,I love this toner. It's really hydrating and it leaves my skin feeling soft and supple. A little goes a long way. I don't find the perfume over the top either. I would certainly be happy to buy this again 
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,Canada,Absolutely not,"Absolutely not. I love love love the fat water toner serum so I decided to give this a try. Immediate burning sensation, washed it off. 5 day later I'm still suffering from blotchy, red bumpy, dry flaky skin. I tried it on my wrist beforehand and no reaction, my doctor said the face is more sensitive than the wrist so it didn't react as much. I've booked an appointment with a dermatologist, but this has really messed up my skin. 

For context, I have combination skin, but more on the dry side in the colder months and oilier during the warmer months. I usually use the fat water toner serum with either the laneige waterbank moisture cream or fenty skin overnight and spf moisturizer. Wash normally with the fenty skin cleanser and twice a week with the pre-show glow. Absolutely bummed this didn't work out with the rest of the lin"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Morning Skin Care Must Have!,"After using this product, I noticed that my skin became more hydrated and looked dewy. I apply this every morning after my serums, and I always make sure to leave my skin damp before applying this. I 10/10 recommend to anyone who suffers from dry skin."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Hydrated skin without the acne,"I received this as a part of the free sample program. As the days get colder, I need a product that can moisturize my skin but doesn't give me acne (I'm acne prone). This product has done exactly that! It's light enough that I can use it in the day when I'm going out."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,Malaysia,strong fragrance smell,"I’ve heard nothing but good things about this toner. I was sooooo looking forward to it to arrive Malaysia. But oh nooo….the fragrance smell is too strong I got a headache every time I used it. Tried for 3 days already, and all 3 days my head hurts. I might continue to use it for its benefits, but not sure if its worth it :( "
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Perfect Primer for Silky Soft Skin!!!,"This toner is amazing for any skin type, but particularly for those who have dry skin. It includes such great ingredients such as Hyaluronic Acid that just plumps, hydrates, and preps the skin for makeup. I have definitely seen a difference in my skin, and I made sure to use it for at least 1 month daily before writing my review. My dry patches are no longer visible and my foundation/concealer looks so much smoother. The super silky texture feels so soft on the skin and the slightly sticky texture makes it the perfect primer to prep the skin before foundation! I definitely have seen my skin improve even without makeup on as well! My skin is much more plump and bright. It has also never broken me out or given my sensitive skin any type of reaction. The slightly fruity, floral scent is also amazing! It helped my dry, sensitive skin turn silky soft after 1 month of daily use! I highly recommend! 

I am so glad I was able to receive this as part of a free sample program!"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,Canada,I use this at nighttime before bed,"I love love love this product. I find it makes me much less oily than the normal Fat Water and it smells great. It's a bit slipperier than the other Fat Water, in the sense that a lot of product can come out when you squeeze the bottle, so just be careful. Honestly, I'm so glad that I compared the two, since this one is so great."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,Australia,Super hydrating,This milky toner is great! I used the original and found that drying but this hydrating version really leaves my skin feeling smooth and glowing. Love it and it smells like milk tea. 
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Fenty Skin Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,"Hydrating but coconut oil ingredient broke me out! If you are acne prone, please beware."

FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,Australia,Yas Yas Yas,"Rihanna does It again. It's so dewy and hydrating for a toner. I have usually struggled with toners, but this is perfect for my sensitive skin. I use it every morning."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Obsessed,I really enjoyed using this toney since it makes my skin instantly feel very soft and hydrated but it also smells so nice. The texture is slightly thicker but it immediately absorbs into the skin. The design of the bottle os unique too where you have to twist the top to open it and then
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Worth a try,I have been enjoying the Fenty fat water that I received from Buzz agent complementary. I use this after I wash my face I have seen that my skin has a nice glow and is vary soft.

FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,Australia,very hydrating ,"The formula is very hydrating, subtle smell & smells lovely. Absorbs quickly, leaves a nice light dewy glow. The packaging is like the fat water but with this particular product I find the products can sometimes be hard to get out it could just be I received a dodgy bottle, cause I’ve check the hole & it’s not clogged at all before I try and get it out. I’ve given it a hard squeeze & even that sometimes is hard to get product out. And one time when it did it was too much! I use it every night as part of my skin slain care routine, I can’t say it’s done anything special to my skin since adding it. It’s definitely not a must, but it is nice if you want to giver your skin a little something extra. I think Fenty are very good with their marketing & it creates such a hype that you want to love there products but honestly, apart from their original skin care…you can get better with other brands "
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Fenty Skin Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,I love how hydrating this is! my skin can get super dry at times so this is perfect before any serums or creams! it doesn't feel oily and only a bit is needed! it definitely will last you some time.

Not only in the clarity but also in the evenness of my skin tone. Before I used to have some dark spots and they are virtually gone! The smell is very faint and not too over powering. It also doesn’t make my skin feel overly greasy after applying it! The packing is very sleek and high end. However, the price tag is not! This is a very affordable alternative that works just as well as some very expensive high end products. I would definitely purchase this product again!  This product does have longevity and a little goes a long way! Overall, I would highly recommend this product to my friends and family. I did received this as apart of a free sample program"

I have dry skin with eczema, and my bf has oily skin but gets dry patches, and both of us are obsessed with this toner! After using it, my skin feels so hydrated and plump and just so soft, I don't even use a serum after it and my skin still feels better than it has with any other toner or serum. The whole product from the packaging to the experience to the efficiency of the products, are 10 out of 10 for me. I will never go without this toner again! Riri truly does no wrong🙌🙌"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Not non-comedogenic,"For all my acne-prone friends out there, this product isn’t non-comedogenic, so there’s a chance it will clog your pores and lead to a breakout (currently me). I do love the smell though"

FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Milky Toner,This toner was an interesting product to try out! I hadn’t tried a milky toner before so I wasn’t sure what to expect. Overall I enjoyed getting to use this product and thought I noticed some positive effects from it. The container itself confused me at first- this product comes in a plastic bottle with a twist lid that you pour/squeeze to dispense the product. This product is a liquid with a botanical and faintly  fruity scent. The toner made my skin feel soft and over time I felt like it helped minimize my larger pores. This is a great product is add into your everyday routine.

FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Best Toner I’ve ever used!,"I have been using this toner for a few weeks, and it has transformed my skin so much! It has helped reduce my breakouts and it makes my skin so glowy! I have received a lot of compliments on my skin ever since I’ve started using it. My skin is oily and sensitive, but it becomes more oily if it’s not hydrated properly and this product is perfect for that. Never did I think a toner would have such an impact on my skin. A lot of products break me out but this one doesn’t. I’ve been using it every morning and night. In the morning, I just use this toner, the Isntree hyaluronic sungel. At night, I use this and Cerave moisturizing lotion, and sometimes I add Kiehl’s daily microdose retinol serum. I received this product as part of a ‘free sample program’ but now I’m hooked and I will be buying it regularly."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Read this to not be stupid like me!!,"The Fat Water is a super cute toner. Don’t be like me and unscrew the whole cap to pour it out!!! You can just unscrew the top a little, turn it upside down, and squeeze the bottle. The little indent on the lid is a hole!!! It took me days to figure this out. The toner does feel moisturizing, it has an interesting smell, kinda starchy to me? After letting it dry, it feels like a little stretchy film on my skin, but not unpleasant. A fun and cute experience which definitely makes me feel pampered! And the bottle looks very classy on my vanity."

When I’m feeling dry, I can use just a layer of this as a nice pick me up, and it gives me a good glow too. Obsessed and will be getting another!"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,Australia,These BEST toner I have ever used ,I didn't think I would ever find something to replace my FAB Oat Hydrating Toner for my super dry skin but I just did!

FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Is it worth it?,I bought this product and used it for a solid month but ended up returning it at the end of week four. It does everything it says it should but my issue is that the hydration given from the toner doesn’t last.

FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Great for a boost!,"After using this product for a few weeks, here are my thoughts. I feel like this is a lightly hydrating toner. It won't fix majorly dry skin, but gives it an extra boost. The scent is great, but the feeling when it dries is odd. It feels like a skin on my face, so I am not sure how well my moisturizer or serums soak in. Overall, if you need a boost in the moisture department, use this."

I was kind of hesitant to use this because most toners I have used in the past give my skin a burning sensation along with drying out my skin with that tightness feeling. I have another toner that is my usual go to to avoid this, but I am so glad to say that this toner will be another go to of mine. I don’t feel any dryness, tightness to the skin, and no burning sensation like other toners! Also a little goes a long way. My skin has definitely felt hydrated and is looking glowy!"

I received this product as part of a free sample program."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Skin is glowing!,"I received this product from a free sample program in exchange for my honest review. For the most part, I really enjoyed the Fenty Skin toner. I used it before I went to bed. The product sinks into the skin quickly. My skin looked more glowy and less dull toned after using it for about a week. I think my skin did benefit from it and I will definitely repurchase when I run out. There is a lot of product as well so I feel like it will last a long time. I prefer this over a lot of other toners I’ve tried. The one thing I would change is the opening of the bottle. I often apply skin care products with my fingers, but because it’s an open top it’s a bit difficult getting the product out without spilling."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Must have!!,I received this product complimentary for my honest review. I loved this I use fenty foundation so it hydrated my face before makeup it works amazing and smells amazing I will definitely be purchasing this product again!
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,New Zealand,Torn about this ,"A good product, I am just not sure if it is as good as it’s sister product - Fat water serum. I do have dryer skin and this does make my skin feel hydrated but does feel to disappear. A little bit of product does go a long way."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Smells amazing!!,Love this product! It smells so amazing and leaves you skin feeling hydrated without the greasy feeling of other products.
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,My favorite skincare product,"This essence is so hydrating and soothing. Soaked into my skin very quickly. No residue or irritation. My skin looks great when I wake up after using it at night. This always made it difficult to find products, even those marketed as hypoallergenic/sensitive, that actually worked with my skin instead of irritating it further. I can honestly say that this essence does what it says it will. It not only calms down my skin and prepares it for the next steps of my skincare routine, it also feels like the hydrating, protecting barrier that my skin naturally lacks. I truly feel that my skin is healthier, happier, and stronger with this essence. Because of this essence alone"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Fenty Skin Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,"This stuff is great! I received a bottle as a part of a free sample program, and I was blown away by this. It smells lovely, and it truly has made such a difference on my skin.

FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,The extra hydration boost we all need!,"I have been using this product for about two weeks now and love the reaults I am getting. The texture is smooth and consistant. It is cooling and hydrating and leaves you feeling refreshed. My only negative and the reson I did not give it a 5/5 stars is the amounf of fragrance in the product. For someone who may have sensitive skin, it could be an irritant for sure. Will buy again, hopefully in stock when I need to replenish!"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,An amazing product!,"I received this product from a free sampling program and loved it! It makes my skin feel super smooth and soft. I use this product daily, so I'm hoping it will restock soon so I am able to purchase some more."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Perfect Year Round Milky Toner,"I was so excited to try this Fat Water Milky Toner Essence since the original Fat Water wasn’t quite hydrating enough to help balance my acne prone/combination skin. This Fat Water Milky does just what it says! It’s nourishing and absolutely helps with dark spots, pores and dryness! The Laneige cream skin toner is one of my favorites, but I only use it during the drier colder months because of it’s emollient finish. This Fenty one feels great for year round use."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,STAPLE IN MY SKINCARE ROUTINE,"Very light,I love the application and the formula. Leaves my skin feeling very clean and refreshed!"

The toner had a lightweight formula which felt very moisturizing and refreshing on my face. It did not feel sticky or greasy at all, and left my skin feeling hydrated and renewed. This is especially important for me in a toner, since I always follow always follow up with a rich moisturizer, so I enjoy toners that layer well under my other skin care products. I also loved the mild tea-like scent of the toner, which was not strong or overpowering. I look forward to continue implementing this product in my skin care routine to see future results. I would definitely purchase again and be sure to recommend to others!"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Love love love,So I received this as a part of a free sample and was genuinely a little nervous about how scented it is. But I loveee the formula. Goes on so smoothly and leave my face looking radiant

Better than any other brand I have tried, I have really dry skin especially on my face and this has helped a lot. I definitely plan on buying this product and recommend it to everyone!"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Hydration Blessing,Where has this been?!  I have very dry Midwest skin that has to adapt seasonally to all the changes.  This has saved me.  I only use it at night.  The scent is super light and not overpowering.  My skin drinks this stuff up and when I wake up in the morning my skin is still very hydrated and moisturized.  Just a shake and a drop or two go a long way with this one.  I can say there is definitely a reason this essence sells out so often!  Grab it while you can!
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,New step in my routine,"I loved the smell of the product, it reminded me of an herbal tea. After using it for a week, I noticed a lot more hydration, smaller pores, reduced redness and minimizing acne. Would definitely recommend for combination skin!"

FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Loved it!,"Very nice! I loved this toner, as someone with dry temperamental skin, it’s nice to have something pretty basic that excels at keeping my skin soft and supple! Definitely would recommend to anybody who needs an extra boost of moisture for winter. Only con for me is coconut oil in the formula because mine tends to be sensitive to that"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Love Love Love,"I really love this Fenty Skin Fat Water. It is very hydrating for my super dry skin. The toner has a very nice milky consistency. I just use my fingers to apply a few drops of product to my face before rubbing it all in. It’s not like other toners that dry out your skin. Instead it is very calming. I would definitely recommend to anyone with dry or sensitive skin. It can work for anyone with large pores too as I have noticed a difference in my pore size. My pores on my cheeks are very noticeable usually but with using this for a week, they are barely even there. It is made with clean ingredients and there is not a strong over bearing scent that makes me feel sick when using it. I absolutely love this product and will buy more when I run out."
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Awesome toner!,"This product made my skin feel super smooth and it smells amazing! I've been using it with my normal cleanser/moisturizer routine and it fits in super well. My skin is super clear right now, we'll see if that keeps up over time!  (I received this product as part of a free sample program)"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,New favorite!,"Received this product as a free sample. It has done wonders for my skin. I don’t have acne, but I tend to have lots of texture. This has smoothed my skin out soooo much and has made my skin so gooey!"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Great for added moisture!,"My skin has been feeling very dry lately with the weather changes so I've been using this toner after my cleanser, letting it sit for a while, and then proceeding with the rest of my skincare routine. It is helping with my blemishes from acne (some scarring and dark spots) so I'm really impressed with the product overall. I don't care for the bottle it comes in as the twist and release cap is messy and will sometimes leave product behind so I have to clean it every time I use it. I think the dispensing would've been more effective if it had been a pump or something. Ideally I would give this a 4.5 star!"
FENTY SKIN-Fat Water Hydrating Milky Toner Essence,USA,Boosts hydration,"I have never used a toner before but I could instantly feel the difference in my skin after applying. I have very dry skin and this boosts hydration under my regular skin care regimen. It’s silky, milky with a slight scent. It was the boost of hydration my skin needed. It Did not irritate my skin at all. Love it, will continue to use it daily."

When I've gotten too much sun, even thou I wear a hat plus high SPF, I'll start using these pads at night on my face, neck, chest, even my arms & legs! These pads exfoliate your skin, get rid of any dark spots/sun damage, smooth out your skin texture, and lighten your skin rather quickly - a total WIN WIN!!!!! I first cleanse my face, then I wipe my entire face, neck, chest and other areas with these pads and then I'll either use my retinol after on my face,neck & chest and then I apply another glycolic body lotion all over my legs & arms. The results are unreal! It's like I'm giving myself peels at home but without the high costs, plus I'm not getting crazy peeling, just brighter, lighter, smooth beautiful skin. Trust me, these work! I take excellent care of my skin with good serums/skincare products/retinol, microneedling, light peels etc. This product is an added plus that I keep on hand especially when summer is over and I know I'm done with getting anymore sun on my body!

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,USA,My Ride & Die,First Aid Beauty is my ride and die.  I am a medical worker and I get mask acne and it is worse in the summer.  The First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads help get rid of the bacteria build-up from being in my mask all day.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Canada,OBSESSED! Safe of acne prone/sensitive skin,"This product is incredible. My skin type is really hard to pin point; I’ve struggled with acne, I have extremely sensitive skin and depending on the products I’m using my skin can be very oily or very dry. For the past four years I’ve used rodan and fields and it worked great for blemish but it stripped my skin and left me fighting to rehydrate my skin so my friend suggested these and I will never go back! Ive slowly started switching all my skin care products to first aid beauty and my skin has never looked better!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,USA,Good for normal skin people,"I’ve used these pads for about a year and my ultimate thoughts are that I find them functional but not necessary. They didn’t make a huge difference to my skin but I enjoyed using them when I thought my face felt very dirty. No cons really, they don’t sting and don’t really have any scent. The pad was useful to physically remove any residual dirt on the face but the formula itself was really mild and didn’t really remove the texture on my face as much as I wanted it to and it didn’t do anything for my hyperpigmentation. All in all, I think this is a good product for people with normal skin and mild texture."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Canada,First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - 60,"These were recommended to me in store and so glad I bought them ! I have sensitive, oily and acne prone skin and I use acne cream twice a day, leaving my skin uneven and often very dry/peeling.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,New Zealand,"Great product, but can achieve the same result at a smaller price point","I love these pads as something to use a few times a week - the ingredients offer a great chemical exfoliant which gave me good skin texture and helped get rid of some stubborn pimples. However, the same ingredients can be found in cheaper products that would achieve the same result and also be more environmentally friendly. The ingredients can also be harsh if you have sensitive skin - I can only use these every few days at most otherwise my skin flares up. These are a good product to have on your shelf for occasional use, maintain their moisture well and do not dry up. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,USA,First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - 60,"As someone with rosacea, I have sensitive skin that can have skin build up on my cheeks.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,USA,Top Tier MVP,"This product, I’ve been using since high school. More than 10 years later it’s still (imo) the mvp. I’ve tried other toners/exfoliates just for the heck of. Curious to see if more money meant resulted in a better product; but nope! I always revert back. This product never breaks me out or causes any irritation. Needless to say, I’m hooked!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Malaysia,Not bad but might have surprise in it (unknown object),"On my first purchase, there was an unknown object (something like a piece of sawdust) stuffed in one of my cotton pad. So I contacted Sephora customer service, providing pictures and video as proof. At first, she proposed to give me either a refund or exchange to settle it. But after few email conversations, the customer service representative replied this is not part of their responsibility for the defect. No reimbursement will be made and they will only refund upon receive the defect item and I have to bear the shipping fee, sending it back to them. Duh....She also proposed me to remove that piece of unknown object and continue using the rest of it which is quite hilarious to me. It is unacceptable because it is not a cheap product. Anyhow it is cost-effective compare to other brands. Just there's surprise in it if you're the ""lucky one""."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Canada,Cut Them in Half to Make Them Last Longer!,"I highly recommend this product. This product helped even out my skin tone, reduce the look of acne scars and reduce the amount of pimples I have during that certain time of month. One tip - to make the pads go farther there is totally enough of the pad that you can cut them in half."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Canada,First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - 60,These pads causes my skin to break out. it irritates my skin and now I'm left with 20 some of these pads and can only just throw them out.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,USA,First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - 60,This is a great product! I like the gentle exfoliation just from using the pad and the solution is very effective. It keeps my skin clear and has a noticeable brightening effect. I do like the slight cinnamon scent as well. These pads are so saturated with solution though that it feel wasteful to throw it away while it’s still soaked. I also use it on my neck and arms just to use it up and it has had a great effect there. There’s extra solution left also which is great to use with cotton rounds after the pads run out.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,New Zealand,effective,I really like these exfoliating pads - they are gentle and didn't cause me any irritation. I have acne-prone skin and seemed to work well for me. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Malaysia,Miss,"Did it work? I don’t know. I don’t see much difference on my face before/after using this. Overall, it just feels like applying wet tissue on your face."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Canada,Great for controlling breakouts,"These are awesome. I got them in a gift set quite awhile ago and didn't really use them.
I started having a breakout on my chest from hot yoga, and I tried tea tree cream and a few other care products and nothing was helping.
On a whim, I grabbed one of these pads, and within a day it started clearing up and a few days later it was completely gone.  They've become a part of my daily routine."

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Singapore,Facial Radiance Pads ,"Didn’t feel much difference using this product. It smelled really plasticky, and stung every now and then. Perhaps it was the exfoliation of the skin? "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,New Zealand,Mrs ,I haven’t used this much but I’ll try to however it does work on your skin. I used this a few times during my night routine and than applied the cream afterwards and your skin actually feels so good! I just feel it’s a little expensive however it goes a long way too…
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Canada,First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - 60,"I love this product, as a teenager who gets bad stress acne and sweats a lot from working out it may not clear everything up but it stops me from getting my normal big breakouts and acts as a good skin base layer."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Australia,good light exfoliating pad,It’s a good light exfoliating pad for just before applying makeup. Not sure if it will do much as a skincare routine but it’s good to do just before makeup to ensure all dead/dry skin is removed before applying foundation. I wipe it across my lips too. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,USA,Leaves face sticky,"I am not a fan of these, I'll finish out the pack I bought but can't say I'd buy them again. The pads are quite wet (better than being dry, but definitely wetter than I'd like) and my face feels sticky afterwards, like there's a slight film left. I only use them while traveling and wouldn't be able to make myself use them daily."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,USA,First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - 60,"a staple in my skincare routine, helps keep my breakouts to a minimum."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Canada,Great product for dry sensitive skin,"I was skeptic about this product in the beginning and only started to use it because I got 2 of them from Christmas limited edition packages (btw it’s a great deal and I but it every year). After a few months, my face really started glowing. Last week I went for a facial after 3 years and the aesthetician said that My face is really clean and not much to extract during the facial! Now I am a big fan."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Malaysia,Affordable ,So I bought this to see if it would be a dupe for Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel. It gives you that tingling sensation when you use those chemical peel but I feel it is not as effective/strong as DDD Extra Strength Peel. Maybe it is a more gentle version of the peel maybe DDD Peel for sensitive skin or similar products.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,USA,not a fan.,"i only gave it two stars instead of one because of the price. it was affordable, but i didn’t like the product itself. it left weird film on my face after using and didn’t feel or look like it was doing anything. also has a weird smell, almost like old lemons."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Canada,First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - 60,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) These seemed to work for a few days.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,USA,Good Product,I’ve used these for many years. I like having the exfoliate on a pad. I have very sensitive and dry skin. These don’t irritate my sensitive and dry skin. I use them daily. Not sure how much they brighten but they do provide enough exfoliation if used often.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Australia,mrs,"These are great. Whenever I switch to another brand I notice, over time, that I lose the brightness in my skin. I was a long sufferer of acne and have the scares to remind me. Add hyperpigmentation and/or malasma to the mix, I’ve got a lot to address! Daily use, at night, brightens my overall complexion as well as lightening the look of acne scares hyperinflation. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,USA,"if you have acne-prone, hyperpigmentation prone…","If you have skin that is prone to break outs (cystic even), and almost ALWAYS get acne scars from every break out…this is for YOU. I have been suffering from acne and sensitive skin for over 20 years. I also have hugeeee pores that cause me to get oily within an hour of washing my face. I’ve been using these pads for a week and omg. My pores are smaller, my skin is glowing and even toned, and every pimple I get gets dried out the next day. I’m shocked, really. I will definitely be repurchasing these for the rest of my life. I get the same effects as I did when I used to get chemical peels but without the intense peeling."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Canada,Great,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I can have super sensitive, dry-discoloured skin and often uneven texture, I also generally dont like cosmetic wipes/soaked cottons. These surprisingly helped a lot and caused no inflamation I used them to help clear and brighten my skin. I LOVE FAB. I followed the pad with the intenese repair cream.Got them as a smaple"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,USA,First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - 60,"I wanted to try these as I heard they were comparable to the Dr. Dennis Gross daily peel pads. I didn't notice as big of a change using these. I did breakout when I first started using them, but it did go away after a few days. These didn't make a significant difference, but it did prep my skin for the future of other exfoliants. These pads are probably more of a beginner exfoliation product."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Singapore,just fine,This product is just okay on my skin. No sting effect. Not as fragrant as Pixi Glow Tonic. It’s a bit sticky as well. But it’s a plus that it has Sephora Clean seal.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Canada,First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - 60,"It’s pretty good if you have sensitive skin, I have dry skin and it’s really good for me because gel bead exfoliators kinda destroy my skin and irritates it, this helped clear my skin tremendously the only thing is it’s bad for the environment that they’re are pads because before you know it your used all 60 pads and gotta to buy another one but it does do what it says it’s does!"

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Singapore,LOVE IT,"i love this exfoliator! used it only for 2 nights, and my skin is smooth as a baby's butt! can be a bit tingly, but my skin feels amazing! highly reccomend"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,Australia,Stripped and dried me :( ,I really wanted to love this product (hormonal acne and acne scarring) but after using it for 2 weeks I have had to cut it out of my routine!! :( I found it was the cause of patches of dry skin and worsened healing sores. I believe my skin was stripped and there could be too many active ingredients. Quite painful to apply if you have healing skin. The extra star though is for their Ultra Repair Cream that has helped to fix this all up!! Applying twice a day instead of once has healed me right up ❤️
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,USA,First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - 60,I love these facial radiance pads! I feel like they really help to clear up my pores and I like how they are gentle enough for sensitive skin. I have thought about preferring them so they would last longer and since I really only use about half of a pad for my face/neck. I wish FAB made just the liquid that you could put on your own reusable cotton pads so they didn’t feel as wasteful though.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,USA,Good for people using Curology,"My dermatologist at Curology recommended these pads as an extra step in my routine to help with anti-aging.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,USA,Love it!,"I love everything about this First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads, Exfoliating Pads with AHA. The design and how easy these can be used! The pads come fairly wet but not dripping (no mess. These were gentle, and made my face feel soft and smooth, been using twice a day for a couple weeks. My face was noticeably more radiant and glowing after use. Does everything is claims to do. Your skin is radiant, and these pads provide the right amount of exfoliation when you use them at least twice a day. I highly recommend theses high quality pads for your face.
I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,USA,Only for Short-Term Use,"I consider myself to have pretty normal skin, neither acne-prone nor sensitive. I used about half of these radiance pads before I realized how much they dried out my skin. I used these once a day after cleanser and before serum and moisturizer. Instead of ""improving skin’s texture"" like it claims, my pores were more noticeable than before and my serum would not apply evenly as a result. I’m not a skincare specialist but I would think the AHAs in these pads produce a drying effect and over time, they have an opposite effect to what was intended. Thus, if you decide to purchase these I would recommend short-term use or waiting between uses to save your skin from becoming too dry and in turn, producing more oil."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Facial Radiance Pads,USA,IN LOVE,"These pads are perfect for when my skin is in need of some serious exfoliation. After I use these pads, my face looks toned and brightened. It is the perfect way to prep my skin before I put on my daily makeup."

LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,Canada,Old formula was so much better…,"I first tried this product in the old packaging/formulation and I LOVED it. I was so happy to see it being offered in glass packaging now since it’s more sustainable, but I was disappointed in the performance of the product. I found it just did so much more for my skin than it does now unfortunately."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,Singapore,nene,The texture is slicky n not greasy and thus lasts longer than other liquidy lotion or toner. With the more slimey sensation its actually easier to control the amount and spread throughout the face. I even put it in the fridge during this summer weather n it feels better when icy :)
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,Malaysia,very hydrating! ,"I’ve been using sk2 essence for a long time and decided to try this out. This is more hydrating than the sk2. This texture is abit thicker and not as runny like water like sk2 so you will not waste so much product, you put less and not have it spilling all over your hands or running down your face. On this part, you get more product for the price you pay. This formula helps to hydrate the skin well and properly nourished the skin, but it doesn’t brighten the face like sk2 does but it’s more hydrating and nourishing to the skin creating a more healthier skin. "
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,Malaysia,La Mer Treatment Lotion ,"I really like the texture of this treatment lotion, it’s been a great addition to my routine, my skin feel plumper and softer, I’ve been using it daily, right after cleansing. I would highly recommend it"

LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,Canada,Hydrated and Dewy,"I love using this along side the exfoliator and the creme de la mer. it is so moisturizing for my dry and sensitive skin. I love it more than the Tatcha essence. the old Tatcha essence formula was amazing, The new one is just way too watery so even notice a difference. I see people saying the 100ml of the treatment lotion is too small but I find it to be the perfect size since it is such a concentrated formula. At least the new formula is. Never tried the old formula."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,La Mer The Treatment Lotion - 150ml,I'm not sure how I feel about this product. I feel that the product amount is so small here that I didn't have enough to test over time to see actual results in the longterm. No large complaints with the product itself.
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,"Give it a try, you won’t be disappointed!","I bought this probably back in April of last year, I got the large size and it lasted until January with twice daily use. I was apprehensive because of the price, but I knew how popular La Mer was and decided to give it a try. If you’ve used a softener, this is very similar. It’s thicker than toner, but still watery. Always made my skin feel moisturised, didn’t burn or sting, and gave me a nice glow during the day, even with moisturiser applied on top."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Must have!,"This is one of my favorite La Mer products! My skincare routine is not complete without this! Applied before serum and moisturizer, it preps my skin so it can absorb other products better. It’s lightweight and not greasy at all. It keeps my skin hydrated. It’s pricey but definitely worth it!"

It’s very thin and watery, but when I apply it just like they show in the video my skin feels fresh, plump and hydrated. It feels so comfortable sometimes I go straight to my sunscreen and forget the moisturizer. It’s a very powerful, healing product.  And the scent is divine, smells like pure luxury haha. Honestly this is my favorite La Mer product, it plays well with any serum or moisturizer of any brand. It’s a fantastic addition to all skincare routines."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,soft and gentle,I honestly love this product. It's so gentle on yet effective on my skin. I will continue using it to see more lasting results. so far its incredible. I love how its also travel size friendly and the product is quality.
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,La Mer The Treatment Lotion - 150ml,"I have been loving this treatment lotion by La Mer! This is my first time using a product with this type of texture, and I really like it! After using this for one week after cleansing, my skin feels more hydrated and also softer. Something else I really like about this product, is that it does not make me feel greasy after applying it to my skin."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,Malaysia,MISSING ITEM,I WISH I COULD LEAVE A REVIEW OF HOW THIS PRODUCT DOES TO ME BUT IN FACT THE ITEM IS MISSING FROM THE PARCEL.

LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Perfect for dry and sensitive skin,"I have been using La Mer products since 2016 and I’m very happy with it. My skin is very sensitive and in the winter it gets so dry because i live in Nyc. La Mer products are the only one that keeps my skin hydrated and brighter. I’m so in love with the New Treatment Lotion by La Mer i have been using it after i cleanse my face. I apply a few drops and gently press into my skin it absorbs super fast. It feels like a very thin serum, the scent is light, it’s super hydration and it doesn’t leave my skin sticky. I follow up with The Concentrate for face by La Mer, The eye concentrate by La Mer and the moisturizing soft cream by La Mer"

LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Fall in love,"very good product, you feel a change in your skin after a few weeks of applying it, it has helped me bring my skin back to life, it does not have a strong smell, it feels light. I started with the small version because I like to try the products first but I will buy the bigger one after this"
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,"Hydrates, plumps, and reduces wrinkles!","The La Mer treatment lotion is a must in my beauty regimen. I use it after cleansing morning and night in place of a toner. The texture is smooth and not runny so it goes on easily without losing product. I apply it directly onto my finger tips and then pat it around my face, especially the areas where I see the most signs of aging (pillow wrinkles are my nemesis). I don’t know what kind of magic is in this little bottle, but after only 2 weeks of use I am already seeing those lines diminished in the mornings when I would notice them most!"
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Extra hydration,From the first day I started using this lotion I noticed the difference in my skin all day I felt hydration...I feel more radiant on my skin...I have also noticed less noticeable wrinkles...I love it and I want the large size.
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,La Mer The Treatment Lotion - 150ml,"Thicker than a conventional toner (almost a runny serum consistency), but goes on without residue and absorbs quickly. Has been amazing with protecting my skin that’s been getting dry and irritated from all the  weather changes. Very hydrating and balancing, helps serums absorb better, helps skin regain protected feeling after cleansing (goes on after cleansing but before serum). I prefer putting it on with my fingers, it’s not so runny that it needs to be used with a cotton pad, but you can definitely use one if you want."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Get the youthful look!,"I was gifted this La Mer treatment lotion and the consistency, results, hydration, and everything in between is too true just as La mer does! The lotion gives great elasticity, gives moisture to the skin, and allows evenness to be seen through and through - a must buy! This gives a youthful, alive and vibrant look to skin everyone is trying to get with celery juice - use both and you won’t be disappointed!"
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Dream,This is my second la mer product and I'm thoroughly impressed again! My skin feels so soft and nourished after using this treatment lotion.

LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Love it,It is the first product of the brand that I try and I love it It is an expensive product but I think it is worth every dollar it costs and I feel my skin alive again it looks radiant and super hydrated try it you will not regret it
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,La Mer The Treatment Lotion - 150ml,I was amazed by the results I saw after using this serum for only two weeks. It has a gel like texture but isn’t too thick. A little goes a long way. I applied after cleansing my face and before moisturizing. My skin was left feeling nourished and looking youthful.
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,La Mer The Treatment Lotion - 150ml,"I use this product morning and night after cleansing my face and it instantly looks and feels hydrated. I apply using my fingers and pat it into my skin. The only drawback for me is the price, but if you’re in the market for luxury skincare, this is a must have!"
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Feels so hydrating,I tried the La Mer treatment lotion & within the first time my face felt already more hydrated. The texture is that of rich water that just goes freshly onto your face. I have tried it for about a week & love it.
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Great products!,"Love The treatment lotion! This is a liquid formula and I use this before I put on serums, this helps serums and moisturizers absorb better on the skin helping the rest of my skincare feel more effective. My skin does feel plumper and softer after about two weeks of use."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,La Mer The Treatment Lotion - 150ml,"Luxury is an understatement. Not only is this formula super lightweight, the hydration it gives my skin is out of this world. It is not sticky at all and absorbs directly into the skin, leaving it plump and glowing. I normally use it after cleansing and follow up with a serum and moisturizer."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,La Mer The Treatment Lotion - 150ml,"Added this treatment lotion to the skincare routine I already have and it made a difference.

LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,La Mer The Treatment Lotion - 150ml,"I absolutely love this product!! It prepares my skin really well for the rest of my skincare routine, its watery, hydrates skin and makes it look more alive. I would definitely recommend it to a friend"
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Hydrating and plumping even by itself,I have tried other La Mer products in the past but this one so far it's my favorite. It's a watery but hydrating texture that sinks in the skin and leaves instantly plumped. I have combination skin and I find I can just use this in the morning and I feel hydrated till my evening routine. So for me it's enough hydration that I have not used anything on top. Plus I wanted to test how my skin felt by just using this alone and so far I feel my skin feels soft and plumped.  I also have mild rosacea and I find that my skin is also less red from using this. So I highly recommend.
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Luxurious with water like consistency,"I was very excited to try this product out for numerous reasons, but mainly because I am a sucker for super hydrated skin. This product has a water like consistency but lacks a mean punch. I immediately can see a difference when I’m wearing it. I apply it after I cleanse my face and use my toner, then follow up with my serums and moisturizer. It feels like a real luxury."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,La Mer The Treatment Lotion - 150ml,"This lotion is light to the touch and not too watery.  It has a fresh neutral scent and doesn’t leave my skin feeling sticky after applying. It has some consistency to it and does a nice job of moisturizing my skin.  I haven’t noticed any dramatic changes to my skin as I’ve only used it for a short period of time after cleansing.  So far, so good."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Love it,This product has truly been enjoyable! I use it everyday now so it has become a part of my skincare regulars. My skin has improved a lot as far as texture. Most importantly it made my skin feel hydrated.
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Luxury for your skin,"Lamer treatment lotion is a luxury for your skin. Loved the texture of the lotion, non sticky and glides on the skin. I have been using this after face cleansing in my night routine for over two weeks now and can see a significant difference in my skin tone. The visible pores have shrunk and the skin feels so smooth. I can see that my skin is thankful. Love this product from Lamer."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Luxurious packaging and good on sensitive skin,First off the packaging is incredibly beautiful and luxurious. I felt like I was opening something on Christmas Day. It came with a beautiful duster/jewelry bag which is great for repurposing. The product sample itself was fairly small but a few drops onto the fingers goes a long way. It almost feels like a toner. I have incredibly sensitive skin and I had no break ours or adverse reactions when using this and it worked well with my other products. I did feel it was hydrating but I really did not notice much of a difference. Overall really love the packaging and the product is good but no visible difference and quite expensive. Excited to try their other products as I’ve heard great things especially about the lotion
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Treatment Lotion Gold,"This treatment lotion is one of a kind! Left my skin feeling hydrated and plump almost immediately after.

Been a long time fan. When I can’t afford anything else in the la mer line I always make sure I’m stocked with the treatment lotion. It’s a year round staple that always hydrates and nourishes my skin. Whether in the summer when my skin is oilier or winter time when it’s drier, the treatment lotion delivers the relief I need. A staple."

I’ve used this lotion daily every morning after my cleansing routine in conjunction with La Mer hydrating emulation, and my skin has never looked better. It evens out my skin tone and visually makes my skin brighter and healthier looking. It keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Feels Luxurious but Very Pricey,"I received a small sample of the treatment lotion so it wasn't enough use to say whether there were lasting benefits or not. But on the day to day use I have enjoyed the lightweight feel that isn't too much for my oily skin, but feels supple and hydrating with just a small amount. I would recommend if you have the budget, but would never spend this much myself"
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,In love,"I’m absolutely obsessed with the serum! I am a huge fan of this brand already, but I had never tried this product before. It’s so smooth and makes my face so soft and moisturized. It’s a little too spendy for me to keep up with but I may splurge once in awhile for this."

LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,La Mer The Treatment Lotion - 150ml,Absolutely understand the La Mer hype! The texture is very refined and not so harsh on the skin. La Mer is definitely suited for all skin types too as I was worried it wouldn’t mix well with my sensitive skin. I use this after cleansing my face every night. Definitely a repurchase!
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,My new new,"I've recently become a fan of La Mer products, this New treatment lotion is so amazing, made my skin feel super hydrated and perked up immediately,  with it's super luxe texture it's my new go to after cleansing!"
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,La Mer The Treatment Lotion - 150ml,"This is my first introduction to the brand and so far it's okay. It's definitely a more runny liquid than I thought but since I have dry skin, I actually don't mind it. The price is pretty steep for the amount of product you receive."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,La Mer The Treatment Lotion - 150ml,"This lotion from La Mer is my new favorite. The consistency is quite watery so I would describe it more of an “essence”, which is less watery than a toner but not quite a serum either, an in-between step of sorts. Anyways, the texture is rich and luxuriously silky. I feel that I get ample hydration and moisture using this as one of my first skincare steps after cleansing. Pair it with a nice serum and moisturizer and you’re good to go!"
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Great Product,"La Mer treatment lotion is the perfect hydrating product to use before moisturiser or serum. It’s very gentle and doesn’t irritate my skin. I love the hydration and calming effect it delivers. It’s overall very good, light, and has no scent. Gifted by La Mer."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,La Mer The Treatment Lotion - 150ml,I absolutely LOVE La Mer products. The Treatment Lotion isn't truly a lotion though. It is more of an essence. It preps skin for serum and moisturizer. It is lightweight and not greasy at all. It does have the trademark La Mer scent to it which I really enjoy. I definitely recommend this. My skin just feels better when I use it. I feel like my products absorb better.
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Luxe!,"Real luxe product! Perfect packaging laconic, perfect beautiful smell! Ideally working on face! smoothes wrinkles, does not cause allergies.  the skin after use looks more radiant and without redness!"
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Pairs great with other products,I’m not a big red lip person but this red is so good ! The formula is so velvety. Goes on so smooth on the lips. The color pigment is so rich. You have to let it dry down completely so it doesn’t transfers. It’s not drying on the lips. The color last almost all day for me. I drink a lot of water all day. I definitely would love to try more colors. The packaging is so cute.
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,La Mer The Treatment Lotion - 150ml,"I’ve used a few other La Mer products and this treatment lotion was easy to incorporate into my regimen. It is a lightweight liquid that is quick to absorb and goes on after cleansing and before serums or moisturizers. The smaller bottle is good for travel, however, the wide bottle mouth makes it challenging to portion out the right amount to use, especially since the lotion is liquid, more so like a toner, and not viscous as other lotions are. Because it is so lightweight it will be great for warmer months in particular although suitable for all months in combination with a regular skincare regimen."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,More Supple,"This is a new product for me - what my dry skin has been missing all along!

I have been using this right after cleansing in the shower, before I apply my eye cream. 

The texture of this miracle liquid is similar to a serum - quite fluid with a bit of a bounce. 

Has changed the appearance of my skin - much more supple + firmer!!

Would definitely recommend!!"
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Hydration Superpower,"This watery yet velvety lotion leaves your skin feeling so silky and smooth. I love how it made my skin feel for the rest of the day.

LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,La Mer The Treatment Lotion - 150ml,"This is La Mer's treatment lotion. I thought it was a gentle, scent-less product that improved the smoothness and clarity of my skin. It seems high quality. I would compare it to the SK-II clear lotion."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,A Lovely Little Potion from the Ocean,The La Mer treatment lotion is a game changer for me. I have extremely sensitive skin and suffer with acne scarring. Incorporating this into my routine has diminished redness and the scars have become way less noticeable - not to mention my skin is SO SOFT!
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,A nice consistency,"This was a unexpected, but nice lotion. It feels Davy, silky and luxurious. I didn’t expect it to be so watery, but it felt good on my skin and a little went a long way which I appreciate because this is a pricey product! If I wasn’t sent this to review I probably wouldn’t buy it myself only because of the price tag, not the lotion."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Love this!,Absolutely love the texture of this lotion!  Smooth and feels great on the skin.  I use it after cleansing and it makes my skin feel refreshed and hydrated.  I would recommend this lotion and it has become a daily staple in my routine.

This is a lightweight non sticky lotion that I used day and night before my other products to maximize benefits.
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,La Mer The Treatment Lotion - 150ml,"A very interesting formula, it felt like applying water to my skin. It glided onto my skin and left it feeling moisturized, smooth, and hydrated. It’s unlike any other product I’ve used before. Highly recommend!"
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Hydrating!,La Mer Treatment Lotion is a water-like essence/serum that has a light scent. I like to use it right after cleansing and it’s hydrating and skin plumping.  It’s like a toner and it really preps my skin for the rest of my skincare.
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Plump and Hydrated,"I have very sensitive skin and was a little nervous that this product would be too much for my skin, but that was not the case. It actually calmed my sensitivity and redness & made my skin feel plump and hydrated. An amazing product!"
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Light weight product,"This is not my first La Mer product that I use and end up loving so much! 
I immediately fell in love with the consistency of the Treatment Lotion. 
It's not thick or greasy. It is a super lightweight product that quickly absorbs. 
Since using this, my skin texture and elasticity have improved, and even the redness from my rosacea has diminished and faded a bit more.  This also wears great under makeup!"
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Like an essence & serum in one product,"Really enjoying this treatment lotion more than I thought I would! I’ve replaced my usual hyaluronic acid with this after cleansing, and it feels like a 2-in-1 essence and serum. The texture is a smooth liquid that glides on easily and leaves my skin instantly hydrated. A little goes a long way, which is nice considering the price point. It would personally be hard to justify the price, and I’m not crazy about the scent, which is why I’m knocking off a star. I think if you’re a lover of luxury products, and La Mer in general, this one will be a keeper in your collection."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,All day hydration!,"This product is magic in a bottle! It provides all day hydration, it’s lightweight, it’s so plumping on the skin and such an easy product to use!

I highly recommend adding it to your skincare routine!"
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Great for sensitive skin!,I absolutely adore this product. It quickly makes my skin look plum and fresh! I try and put any leftover on my neck or hands as a little goes a long way. There’s a very light scent. Very nice nothing too strong. I’d say if you have sensitive skin it’s a real game changer.
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Recommend this product,"Texture is a kind of thick and transparent liquid. It is thick but not so sticky. 
lotion is very light and spreads well.
It has calmed and nourished my skin. 
It has also balanced out the redness of my skin. I will definitely continue to purchase this product."
LA MER-The Treatment Lotion,USA,Perfect Base for Dry Skin,"Now that the weather is beginning to get warmer here in Texas, my skincare products start to change too. I have very dry skin so I need a product that will deliver hydration to jumpstart my skincare routine. I have been using the New Treatment Lotion by La Mer after I cleanse my face. I use a dropper to apply a few drops into my hand and gently press into the skin. You can also use a cotton round. It feels like a very thin serum, almost water like, yet it has a velvety feel to it when applied and massaged into the skin. I follow up with eye cream, serums, and moisturizer which leaves my skin plump and hydrated. It’s the perfect base for when I apply makeup or for the days I don’t wear any."
DR.JART+-Ctrl-A Teatreement™ Toner,Malaysia,toner ,I got this to try it out for myself since my friend was using this and told me that it works wonders and it really does ! It’s not too harsh on the skin and leaves your skin smooth and fresh 
DR.JART+-Ctrl-A Teatreement™ Toner,Malaysia,Suitable for acne prone skin,This product is really suitable for those with acne/oily skin. Skin feels better after using this range of products. I am also using their cleanser and moisturizer
DR.JART+-Ctrl-A Teatreement™ Toner,Singapore,control acne ,Repeated purchase. I bought it for my girl. She finds it effective to control oil and reduces her acne and outbreak. It is soothing and not too drying z 
DR.JART+-Ctrl-A Teatreement™ Toner,Singapore,not bad! ,"The toilet is quite refreshing, there is a coup cooling sensation when you apply with a cotton pad. However I do hope that this product can be a little bit more refreshing after application. The product can make your face feel a little bit sticky somehow."
DR.JART+-Ctrl-A Teatreement™ Toner,Malaysia,Good,Bought this for my son who has hormonal acnes. It works but you gotta use the whole set religiously. Good no doubt but they are pricey.  Get them during sale. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Singapore,great feel,I have almost all of the banana bright C range products as i love the smell and the effect it gives on my face and the glow on my skin!!! This is yet another amazing item to add to the regime. Worth it!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,New Zealand,in love with this,This made my skin visibly brighter and so soft. I am genuinely impressed by this product and like that you only need 3 drops and maybe a extra drop for the neck as well.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,New Zealand,Really Yum!!,Quite pricey but I got this on special and I had to try it as I love all things orangey.  The essence has a gorgeous citrusy fruity smell and is nice and light to apply and is absorbed immediately into my skin. My face then feels very refreshed and primed. If you love the smell of oranges then you must try this product!!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Australia,Refreshing and hydration,"I love this product. It feels really nice on the skin. Gives a nice healthy glow without looking too slick and fake. Not sticky like many other vitamin C's. I've been using it for a several weeks now and it helps to fade sun spots and even out skin and also feels refreshing and hydrating. I love putting it in a spray bottle and spray it on my face on hotter days to help cool and hydrate my skin. Plus it smells absolutely beautiful, like a tropical holiday. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Morning and night essential,I have tried a few vitamin c serums but never an “essence” before but I am pleasantly surprised! It smells amazing if you like orange scents and the results are great! My face feels refreshed and looks so healthy!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Yummy scent and results,"What's not to like about this essence? First, the smell is an AMAZING orange slap in the face, in a good way. The essence applies smoothly and absorbs rapidly, leaving my skin feeling soft and supple. I have combination skin that can often be dry, but this product is surprisingly hydrating (I pair it with a hydrating toner and moisturizer, but notice a difference even before the moisturizer). I've been using this for a little over a week and my skin seems a little brighter and more even. A little goes a long way, so this bottle will last quite a while. Definitely a nice addition to your skincare routine if you suffer from dryness and/or dullness."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Australia,best smelling product!,This has to be the nicest smelling skincare product I’ve ever used! It literally smells like freshly squeezed oranges. My skin feels so hydrated after using it every night. Can’t wait to see bigger results from using more of the bottle
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Singapore,Great!,I’ve used this product for slightly more than 3 weeks now. I love it! Price is high but the bottle is huge and you only need 4-5 drops per usage so I think the mileage for using the product will be long ha. Love the fresh scent and the way it seeps into my skin. Will try to guasha it in next time
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Australia,Ferment essence,"I’m a big fan of all things Ole Henriksen so I was curious to try this essence. I love it’s citrusy scent. After toning I wiped the essence on with just my fingertips. Whilst I did notice an improvement in the clarity of my skin after using day and night for a fortnight, I’m not sure that it’s essential to add yet another step to my skincare routine. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Canada,Everyone needs this in their skincare routine,"The best! Hands down. I’ve recently gone through a history horrible break out which I’ve never had in my life but lord have mercy, this essence is the holy grail for brightening skin and fading acne marks. Get this ASAP"

OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Excellent for hydration and brightening!For reference I am 36 years old. Not sure why my profile and review signature says over 54.

OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Canada,Worth a try for brighter skin!,"I noticed a difference within 2 weeks of using this essence. My skin appeared visibly brighter, more glowing, and had a more supple texture after using it. It absorbs really nicely into your skin, and sits well underneath other skin care products and make up. A little goes a long way with this one. The scent is delicious and not overpowering. It fades once on your skin. Highly recommend trying this one!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Love this!,"absolutely love the way this product makes my skin feel! It gives me a subtle glow that make my skin look refreshed and energized. I also love the fragrant citrus smell that is light, and not overbearing. My skin looks and feels so healthy!"

OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,BEST VITAMIN C SERUM IN THE GAME,Absolutey obsessed with this product! I just started skin cycling and added this as my vitamin c serum on my reset days (days without exfoliator or retinol). My skin tone has never been brighter or more even and I swear it's because of this product! Highly recommend if you're looking for an excellent vitamin c serum!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Malaysia,Citrusyyyyy,Yassssss love love love Ole products! It is like putting orange juice on my face and I LIKE IT! My skin will look healthy and glowing throughout the day. I cannot skip the essence and sometimes I put twice during my skincare routine hehe.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,New Zealand,Good value essence,The essence sinks in easily and gives good long-lasting hydration. Very good for under moisturizer and makeup. The size is also really good value for the price - you get 120ml.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Canada,Love this product,After using this product for the past month I am loving it. Applies easily without any stickiness and hydrates my skin all day. Highly recommend
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Australia,amazingly good,"this! this literally lives up to the hype.. I could actually see the difference it was making! I always see the same sephora consultant, she gave me a sample and after one use I went straight online and bought it!! 
"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,partner to toner,"This is amazing! Leaves my face feeling absolutely quenched and looking fresh! In combination with OLEHENRIKSEN toner, makes for a powerful duo. Definitely keeping this in stock and in skin care routine!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Canada,Makes me glow!,"I've been using this product for about 6 weeks now, and have been loving it! This is my first time using a vitamin C product, so it took my skin a few weeks to detox, but I'm so glad I kept with it during that time. I wake up with my skin glowing now, a much different sight than what I'm used to.

I also have rosacea, and thankfully this product doesn't irritate or make me flare up. The look of my acne scars is definitely going down and my skin has become more evenly coloured. 

The scent is also amazing! Especially in the morning, helps wake me up."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Philippines,good,"Does not cause any irritation on my sensitive/dry/skin.

Got this less 25% off on sephora’s sale. Great value for money. Will definitely re-purchase. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,The scent of this is absolutely heavenly- like a fresh squeezed orange picked right from a SoCal tree. It’s cooling on the skin and works well under my moisturizer. I’m just not sure it’s as power as some of the other vitamin C serums I’ve tried - the jury is still out on that.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,So far so good,"Only been using this for a week so I’ll have to come back with a later review, but I LOVE the way this smells and the consistency. I can tell a definite glow in my skin. I’m new to vitamin c serums and essences in general, but I’ve never been more excited for a skincare product in my life. I will definitely be repurchasing"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Fantastic especially paired with the other C serum. Can see my skin changing for the better will buy again
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,"Super amazing! I hadn't used Vit C before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I started using this every other day just to get my skin used to the product. I love how it works to make my skin absolutely glow. The changes have been small and incremental, but I can tell that over the long-run it will be great at helping my skin. It also smells great, very much like a dreamsicle."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,"A product that really works. I’ve seen amazing results . Buy it, thanks me later."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Malaysia,Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,"Bought this to replace my Drunk Elephant hydrating serum and I think it works just fine. I love the scent of the essence that it gives you a kind of refreshing feel. Overall, not bad. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Canada,Best Vitamin C Essence EVER :),"This is a wonderful product.  The 1st time you use it, it can make you skin a little red, but the 2nd time it wont, you will just have the benefit of this wonderful formula.  The smell is so amazing as well, to bad it doesn't last a little longer it so refreshing.  Been using it now for at least a few months and it is now part of my normal routine.  Just love this."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Wonderful Lotion,I love this product. I use it every morning and night. Its light weight but still very effective and makes yours skin feel soft and dewey. Makeup goes on smoothly. Best of all it smells amazing. I will continue to purchase the products.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,One of the best Vitamin C I have ever used! My skin has never looked so good! Love the orange scent. My skin looks a lot brighter and glowy! I used on my husband skin and it faded his dark spots in a week! Amazing!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Canada,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,"It stung, so I returned it. It was also kind of hard to apply. I would have preferred it if it was a spray or a mist because it’s very liquidy."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Canada,All about the Glow,"I picked this up after reading a bunch of excellent reviews on this product and it did not disappoint.  I use this after double cleansing (Sulwhasoo). Two drops of this in my hands covers my entire face and neck nicely ( It smells sooo nice like freshly peeled oranges), I follow it up with the YSL Hydra Bounce Essence and Aveeno Calm and Restore Cream. My skin looks so glowing and clear. My sister in law figured I was pregnant and was telling my In-laws that my skin was absolutely glowing and beautiful and that I must be pregnant again....I am not pregnant its just this AMAZING product! I have even started my husband on it. Everyone should try this product."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Canada,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,"I’m in love! I will always keep buying this. It’s milky, creamy, light, and very refreshing. It feels amazing using one freshly cleanser skin. Asthetically, the bottle is glass and heavy and def feels like a luxurious product"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Singapore,Brighten & Hydrates skin!,it's by far one of my favorite Essence! Not only does it smells like real orange juice but it's also lightweight and absorbs very well into the skin. The white colour formula doesn't leave any residue at all. My skin feels supple the next day and overall brightens up after 1 -2 weeks of use.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,I have been enjoying incorporating this product into my normal skincare routine. It has a milky consistency that is easy to apply and absorbs well. It makes my skin feel hydrated and gives it a subtle glow. It has a nice citrus scent that is refreshing. I think I need to use it more to see any long term benefits but so far I am really enjoying it!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Philippines,Awesome so far,"This is my first time using it, and I love how it feels few minutes after applying it. Also loved the scent as it smells like fresh-cut oranges. Definitely a good essence to incorporate into your daily routine but it is a bit on the expensive side "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Singapore,Nice smell!,"I don't usually use essences as my skin is oily, so I usually try to minimize what I put on my face. Tried this and I totally love it! Makes my skin super smooth and supple and it works well for my oily skin! It also has a great citrus-y smell. Love this!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Malaysia,brightening effect ,"i could say that this is my best essence for my combination skin. its so easily absorb, keep a brightening effecr and its so refreshing! so yeah, if u looking for a product for brightening effects yes this is the one you should try! and i actually love the smell too!"

OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Australia,Like fresh-cut oranges,"I can’t get over how good this smells! It’s just like freshly cut oranges. I really enjoy essences and I am loving this one at the moment. I like the extra hydration it gives, and if it lightly exfoliates as well, then even better. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,New Zealand,strange but not bad,"a little weird, its orange water. not bad though. bottle is very big and and you don't need much.a little weird, its orange water. not bad though. bottle is very big and and you don't need much."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Malaysia,feels good and smells great,"This is my first time trying Ole Henriksen. At first, I was concerned with the strong orange scent, but my skin doesn't react to it and i keep using it every day to prep my skin. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Australia,not sold on this one,Rated this one halfway as I’m unsure if it’s actually made a difference to my skin? Reviews on this were great which is why I have purchased but I must admit that I don’t see a difference with my skin?? 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Australia,Excellent ,Has made a huge difference to my skins hydration with the cold windy weather we have been having. Using morning and night and my skin is plump and hydrated
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Singapore,Item Batch Code 1M01A,"I will preface this review by saying the older Ole products have no expiry labels. This current batch: coded 1M01A was manufactured December 2021, for all who wonder, or have received older products.

Decent compared to other products (like Caudalie and Lancome) received during the sale with a one-month shelf life before expiry. I wish Sephora would not trick customers into thinking their purchases are from a shelf-stable batch by omission of best before labels.

I will use this toner up and not repurchase."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Grab it!!!,I have been using it for 2 weeks religiously and my skin looks absolutely beautiful! My husband has been complimenting that my skin looks super clean and is glowing! I highly highly recommend this to everyone.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,was gifted by Ole Henriksen...... i didn't get the product but i heard a friend of mine Said that she really likes it and She have multiple products from this brands... I also check out Their Instagram page in I would definitely recommend
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,"I received the Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence complimentary from Ole Henriksen. The essence works well to help brighten up dull skin. The scent is amazing and reminds me of oranges. I use this essence right after toner and it helps prep my skin for skin cream and sun creams. I like that it does not leave my skin feeling sticky afterward, I can the difference before and after I use it because it helps plump up my skin and helps with dark spots and dull skin."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,I was skeptical about adding an essence to my routine because it seemed like another product to waste money on but I love this! My skin feels fresh and hydrated. I love the whole vitamin C line from Ole and this is another winner for me. A little goes a long way and it's a big bottle too so definitely worth the price!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Glowing!,"I love this product. The smell is 10/10, lightweight, super absorbing, and really does wake your skin up. 
The packaging is also on point. 

At first, I was hesitant because the price point for a product like this is a bit high. After pacing in Sephora, I ended up giving it a try and I don’t regret it! 

It makes my skin glow and has brighten dark spots. I look forward to using this product everyday! I use to apply it AM and PM, but I now just do PM. If I see my skin looking really tired, I’ll apply it in the morning. I’m sure this will last me until the end of this year."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,This serum is one of the best I’ve ever tried. And I’ve tried em all! Buy it you won’t regret it!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,"zesty, fresh smell and helps with dark spots",I’ve used this product for about 2-3 weeks and it has given my face a glowy and moisturized look that my dry patches and some hyperpigmentation has gone away and lightened up. This has a strong orange smell - but I really like it. This plays well with my other skincare products and is a lot better than the Tatcha essence which I thought did nothing to my skin even after having used it up. I always look forward to applying this everyday because of the smell and because I know that it treats my skin’s dryness and dark spots.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Singapore,Best Fermented Essence,"This is another superstar product fr Ole Henriksen. The smell is heavenly n a perk me up. It smells like fresh cut oranges. Upon application it was immediately soak up by my skin leaving no trace of stickiness. What u see is a matt, glowing n smooth to touch skin. It’s quite hydrating n skin appears brighter. This is one product that I will incorporate into my daily skincare routine n keep repurchasing until I chance upon another better product than this. Well done Ole Henriksen👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Malaysia,Great so far,"First time using it, the orange smell just freshen up m day. Haha…really love it that it does not irritate my skin. The smooth and soft feeling that comes after it is great. Really great products. Will consider buying it again. Just that a little pricey though. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Australia,Sunshine in a bottle,Obsessed with this new product. It smells fantastic and makes my skin feel so refreshed and energised. It's my new fave first step in my skincare routine.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Great essence,After I used for two weeks I noticed brighter skin. It also faded my acne scars that I had for years. Scent is like you cut the fresh orange. I feel more firmer skin. I can compare this with very high priced products like I used dicorte essence. The result of this is great. Highly recommend this
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,"As someone who always forgets to use a vitamin c serum, I was glad to see an essence that incorporated vitamin c into the formula. This essence does have a citrus scent but I enjoy smelling it in the morning. It layers well and doesn’t cause skin irritations. As with most skincare products, it will take time to see long term benefits but so far I am enjoying the hydration and antioxidant powers of vitamin C."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,"I’ve got to be honest this is the most successful ole product I have ever used! The scent, the texture and the application is absolutely beautiful. I use this in my morning routine and my skin instantly looks smoother, brighter and my pores are almost non existent!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Gifted from Ole Henriksen. This orange essence vitamin C essence has become one of my favorite vitamin C products! My skin feels very hydrated after use and noticeably has appeared brighter after a week of use. I do feel a slight tingling on my skin upon application but otherwise no irritation!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Canada,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,This has visibly brightened my skin. It smells like you’ve just cut into an orange rather than a creamsicle scent of the c rush brightening cream. Refreshing and effective.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,I have never use an essence before in my skincare routine and I am pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable this step is in my routine. I use it after toning my face and by gently patting it into my skin. I noticed my skin is getting clearer and brighter after 2 weeks of using!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,Great essence if you struggle with acne scar and absorption of skincare. I have been using SK II essence for years and it have been working great. This product is pretty comparable to SKII but I do notice a brighter complexion after using Ole Henrikson.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Refreshing for my dull skin,This essence looks milky in color but the formula is on the super lightweight side. It is hydrating and absorbs nicely. It gives a slight glow to the face but doesn't leave my combination skin feeling too dewy so it's fine for me. My current skin concern is dullness overall and of course aging so this product is right up my alley. I use it in conjunction with other Vitamin C products and my skin has been looking less tired. The packaging is heavy and very sturdy but definitely not travel friendly. I have been using essences for about two years now and always get excited to start a new one. I do feel it helps all the products I put over to absorb better too. It does however have a strong citrusy/orange scent to it. If you are sensitive to fragrance keep this in mind. I do enjoy it and really love its benefits so I will be using it up to see if I notice results with continuous use.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,"This essence has a lightweight texture that absorbs quickly. Your skin will feel hydrated and glowy, but for oily/combo skin, it may overdo the glow and appear oily instead. It also has a strong scent that may be irritating if you have sensitive skin."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Super hydrating but very strong scent,"As a toner & essence lover, I was excited to try this new launch! My skin type is combination acne prone and it’s always dehydrated. Thus, I love anything hydrating. This essence is milky and it’s hydrating with a slight moisturizing component. It’s like a more lightweight Laneige Cream Skin! However, the scent is super strong. I hate artificial orange flavors and unfortunately, the scent for this lingers. I was unable to see any brightening benefits from this but I used it for roughly two weeks. I’ll be passing this along to a friend but if you like orange or citrus scents, this will be the essence for you!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,"Absolutely amazing! Such a great product, and i can definitely see a difference in my skin. It is super straightforward and easy to apply. I also really like the consistency. I have combo to normal skin, and this does a great job at brightening!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,"This is my first time trying an essence and I am obsessed! The smell is amazing, and my skin has definitely looked brighter & feels more hydrated in just the last week that I've been using this essence."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Great!,"I have really dry and dull winter skin and really needed something to help hydrate and brighten. This stuff is great! I was really excited to see they launched an essence, and I'm liking it so far! Would recommend you to try if their other products have worked for you!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,A great essence to add into your routine if you are looking for glowier skin. I love that this essence is nice and light and doesn't feel heavy. It sinks into the skin and lawyers well with other products.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Smells Amazing!!,"I was sent this complimentary from Ole Henriksen. I haven't been using it long enough to see results yet, but it smells amazing like fresh oranges and has a milky consistency. It absorbs quickly into my skin with no sticky or tacky feeling. So far, it's leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth. I'm excited to see the full results in the next 6-8 weeks!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,"I’ve been using this now for the past week in my daily skin routine and I love how soft and refreshed my face feels! In both the morning and night, I first wash my face, then apply this on my face (I lay versus rub in). I then apply my serum and moisturizer on and it goes on well with my routine."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,"i love this product. it really helps to brighten my skin, but it also isn’t irritating or anything like that. i would even say it helped to calm my skin a lot and it really helps to keep my breakouts at bay as well"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Refreshing and soothing,A refreshing toner that removes all the gunk from my face! My face looks so much dewier after using this in the morning. I love the addition of vitamin c which helps brighten and preventing aging.  It's gentle and nongreasy.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Lovely orange scent,Smells exactly like orange and orange peel. The color of the essence is of a milky orange color. It comes in a really huge bottle as well which is great for value. After using it for a few days I really noticed my overall skin brightening up and I do really enjoy the scent as well.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,hydrating & skin tone evening Orange deliciousness,"Ole Henriksen gifted me this essence for reviewing purposes, and it does not disappoint. 
I use this milky essence mornings and evenings after a mist and before serums and lotions. It takes a second to absorb but plays nicely with the other products in my routine.
I feel that my skin is more hydrated and overall more even looking since using this essence. It features some great ingredients such as Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide, Lactobacillus Ferment as well as lots of different fruit extracts rich in antioxidants. It also claims to smooth fine lines but I haven't been losing it long enough to notice results in that area.
One thing to note is that it does have a very strong (natural) citrus scent. Personally I am a citrus lover, so I find it quite invigorating but I could see that it would be too much for others.
Overall I have to say that this one is a keeper for me (which has not been the case with all Ole Henriksen products)."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,"Vitamin c is my holy grail. It has changed my skincare game and I love trying new products with vitamin c. This essence is amazing. First of all, the scent!! It’s like applying freshly squeezed orange juice to your skin. Secondly, it is very hydrating and third, it gives this beautiful radiance after one application."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Smoothing,I've  heard great things about Ole Henriksen  and finally got the chance to try a product! I suffer from acne and due to that I have alot of scarring and texture and my skin tends to overdry with acne treatments I have oily skin too. Since using the essence my face feels so much smoother my makeup glides on impeccable and I have notice some of my acne scaring fading a little my complextion is much brighter! Love the super hydration it gives my skin
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Good stuff,"This is a great way to hydrate my skin in the morning as well as getting that dose of vitamin C that my aging skin so needs. My skin felt Fresh, Bright, and hydrated immediately. It also made my skin completely ready for my makeup. No dry patches or dull spots to be seen!!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Pretty Good,"Truth Serum is much better for the face.  However, this is great near the eyes, hands and arms."

OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,"Hydrates, brightens, and defends skin.","This vitamin C essence hydrates, brightens, and defends skin against pollution and free radicals. I like that it has the quick-absorbing, lightweight texture of a toner and the powerful benefits of a serum. Ingredients include fermented orange peel extract that nourishes, conditions and refreshes the skin. Hyaluronic acid and niacinamide help to drench skin in moisture and illuminate the look of fine lines and wrinkles, while also strengthening the skin barrier, for an ultra-supple, healthy-looking glow. And the smell of essence is amazing. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants instant hydration and brighter skin."

OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Love the glow this gives my skin,"I love the way my skin has been glowing since using this essence. I love the scent of the product , it smells like fresh oranges, but if you don’t like scented skincare it may not be for you .  I would recommend this product for someone looking for a brighter complexion,  not the milky consistency will not provide the moisture that you may think. Overall I love the product, I also followed up with the banana bright serum and moisturizer in the am."

OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,My skin has felt and appeared glowy-er since using this essence. It does have citrusy scent and is a bit strong at first but it quickly dissipates. My skin felt more hydrated and pores appeared as if disappeared.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Fresh Smooth Glowy Start,"I’m quite impressed with the benefits this essence booster laid upon my skin. First off it smells like oranges so it’s quite refreshing! The formula is a thick milky consistency that absorbs quickly without an ounce of sticky or tacky aftermath. I noticed instant hydration and glossy/glowy-ness. I also definitely noticed a considerable amount of absorption power when I applied this before the rest of my skincare routine. I’m definitely going to continue using this, even when I just need a pick me up because it’s that wonderful."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Love the feel upon application!,"Love the citrus scent and the mildness of the product. Did not sting my face at all! Gentle enough to use twice a day!
 It has a whitish hint and medium-thickness on its texture. But easily absorbed by the skin.
 Tried this product for a week and definitely noticed my skin felt smoother and brighter! This means Vitamin C is absolutely working!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,"This product is insanely good. This is my first time trying an essence and I am obsessed. I have always trusted this brand with my vitamin C products but this specific product is perfect for my skin.

OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Best vit c product,Love this essence. This brand creates the best vitamin C product on the market. This one is obviously not an exception. I love the fresh orange smell. It energizes me and wakes me up in the morning. Application is a breeze. Perfect consistency. It is easy to apply. It absorbs fast. It's literally perfection. After application my skin is soft!  Does not clash with make up. My dark spots have lightened which I am really happy about. I have been struggling with dark spots for a while now! I am in Iove with the quality of this product. My skin loved it. Worth to give it a try. You won't be dissapointed.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Hydrating essence,"I’ve incorporated this essence into my skincare routine for the past 5-6 days. For reference my skin is oily and normally responds well to vitamin c products so no sensitivities here.

The milky-like texture is enjoyable to apply and it smells like oranges. I do notice some added hydration so far which is important in my routine since my oily skin dehydrates easily. I’m also using this essence for the antioxidant protection against free radicals/pollution which can contribute to aging skin. I’m happy to see added ingredients like hyaluronic acid, niacinamide + peptides in this formula too. 

I do however need to use this longer to comment on the brightening effects, I notice a slight glow in my skin but too soon to tell after only a few days."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,"This product smells like Sunkist. It’s very strong scent initially but fades after it absorbs. The product is also very hard to get out of the bottle. I had to shake it pretty hard to get any product out. Also, it did not come sealed. I would not purchase or recommend."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,USA,Ole Henriksen Barrier Booster Orange Ferment Essence,"I’ve never used an essence before but after trying this one, I’m hooked! I’ve been using this in both my AM & PM skincare routine and I’m regally with the results I’m seeing. My skin looks brighter & feels more hydrated. It smells incredible, absorbs quickly and gives my skin a nice glow. I highly recommend trying this one & I’ll definitely be purchasing it again!"

ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Great for calming reactive skin,"Second time this saved my skin! I used the ordinary 10% niacinamide / 1% zinc and it gave me a bad chemical burn and reaction. I used this for 3 days and it helped my skin so much. It is recommended to use on a cotton round but I put it on with my hands and pat in until it soaks all the way in. The smell is light, the consistency is like water & it leaves my skin somewhat luminous and hydrated. I follow up with my fave moisturizer and I’m good to go. The itchy and burning bumps are gone and I am left with a bit of scarring and some flaking but overall my skin is MUCH calmer and smoother after using this. I recommend this product to all my sensitive skin girls. Before is from 10/21 & after is from 10/24."

Lots of redness, dryness, and some acne that I usually don’t have! I swear this has made it so much better!! I’m pretty sure I’ll always have this in my skincare lineup now!!!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,Singapore,Absolutely love it!

ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,Malaysia,Go to toner,"I have sensitive skin. Helps to exfoliate and tones down red patches on my face.

Hope to have more products on the shelves, can try more"
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,It's a perfume,"I paid out of pocket for this product. I bought it without looking at the ingredient list just because I kept seeing it on social media. There are so many essential oils and fragrances in this product. Even though my skin did not react/ allergic to it, I decided to throw it away because I prefer fragrance free products on my skin"
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,Singapore,Toner,"Best and texture is good. Also not sticky, when apply to my skin. This product is so recommended because it's contain ingredients herb and beautiful accent.
"
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,Canada,Exceeded expectations!,"For reference, my skin: fair, combo/oily, adult acne, some rosacea

I received a sample of this in a gift bag, so really had no expectations for it, but turns out I absolutely love it. It's very watery, more of a toner than a lotion - I use it nightly under any serums (usually vitamin C or a retinol) and a night cream. It provides the perfect boost of moisture if your skin is naturally dry or simply irritated. I found it help calm my summer blotchiness/rosacea without breaking me out at all. It also seems to cut the burn/irritation of any harsher products applied on top. I'd say it's slightly less hydrating than a pure hyaluronic acid serum, but much more calming, which is exactly what my skin type needs. It lasts quite a while, too. I put maybe a dime size squirt in my palms and rub it on my face that way and, with once daily use, the sample bottle I've had for months isn't even halfway gone. 

Overall, if you want a gentle serum/toner to use under (or after) harsher products, or if you just need a boost of calming moisture, I'd highly recommend trying this. 

Just for comparison, I'd say the closest thing to this I've tried has been Glow Recipe's Avocado Ceramide Serum (different ingredients, but same claims of redness relief and moisture) and I found this one more moisturizing and MUCH more calming (and more wallet-friendly!)."
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,"Light, healing, hydrating, lovely","I love this product! It gives great hydration, soothes inflammation (I have sensitive skin that gets red really easily), is non-oily & doesn't clog my pores (am rather acne-prone), feels clean and light and I really like the natural, earthy smell of it.

But the lotion is by itself very calming and hydrating. I like the mild smell it has and it’s part of my daily routine now . I have dry sensitive skin
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Wasn’t really a fan,I wasn’t really a fan of this product. I didn’t like the smell that much but I did like the way it felt on my skin. I let my fiancé use it and he loved it on his skin and the way it smelled I guess it’s more for a man in my opinion.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Origins Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief &amp; Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion - 200ml,I have never tried a product like this before.

ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Loved it,I received this product to test it out for my honest review and I must say I was really impressed. I was hesitant to use it at first as my skin is very sensitive and reacts fast to new products but surprisingly I didn’t have any bad reaction with this. Instead I felt my skin smooth and hydrated.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Watery but effective.,The solution is very watery but you can smell the mushroom extract instantly.  Be careful when pouring it out.  It is soothing and calming for the skin and provide hydration and nourishment.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Nice and Cooling Liquid Lotion!,"I have combination/oily skin and I've been applying this treatment lotion twice daily for a few weeks and I'm really enjoying it! Right out of the tall, recyclable bottle, is a  watery texture I apply directly to my clean hands and apply it to my freshly cleansed face. This toner lotion (more like liquid) absorbs quickly and does a fabulous job at hydrating and plumping my oily/combination skin. I have noticed a significant difference in my pores and uneven texture. With consistent use my skin now appears brighter, more even skin tone, while reducing redness almost immediately. I also struggle with clogged pores in my t-zone & I've experienced no issues while using this. It takes away excess oil, without drying me out. I highly recommend giving this product a try!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,Canada,essential oil galore,"Really didn’t like this product. The actual content of mushroom extract is very low, it’s mostly just essential oils which didn’t help my skin. Left my skin with some breakouts and just wasn’t the hydrating toner it’s advertised itself to be. I guess the only benefit it did provide was smoothen some texture around my nose. Currently using it on my neck and décolletage to finish up the product, and haven’t experienced any issues but just doesn’t seem worth it honestly."

I have issues with my skin barrier being damaged, so having a soothing and repairing product is a must for me. This lotion feels more like a toner or watery serum, but I really enjoy the texture of it. The formula makes it penetrate into my skin easily, and every time I have used it, I have noticed less redness and skin irritation overall. Using this in the morning as my first step also creates a great base for my makeup and I've noticed a difference with how it wears. I highly recommend this product."
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Nice product but not life changing,"This is a nice treatment lotion that seems to be hydrating and slightly reduces pores.

ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Soothing,I been able to try this product for a while now. I absolutely love it.

It was really great. It reduced my redness really fast. It isn’t completely gone but it is lighter. It’s also more runny than a cream. I would’ve loved an actual cream lotion but it works so that’s okay. I also used this on rougher areas of my body and it got smoother than before pretty quickly. I definitely recommend for dry skin or redness
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Haven’t noticed a difference,"This is a toner, not really sure why they refer to it as a lotion. It’s supposed to balance your skin pH, everything all other toners are supposed to do. I haven’t noticed a difference at all between using it and not using it. It hasn’t changed my skins texture or improve any of the imperfections over the course of my 3 week usage. I haven’t noticed any downsides however. A lot of products cause me to breakout, and this product hasn’t. I wouldn’t recommend it, try another toner."

I used this on my legs, arms, hands, face and neck. It immediately soaked in and started working. It has a nice subtle smell. The packaging and ingredients are all made from healthy materials. The only thing I would change is that the formula itself is super thin liquid, I wish it was a thicker gel or cream. Other than that I love it and will continue to use it."

 My experience: For reference I have oily, acne prone, sensitive skin with some redness on my cheeks. This is a light, watery toner with a hint of an herbal scent. Absorbs into skin quickly without leaving a film or sticky residue. Hydrates, softens, plumps & soothes red, irritated skin. Serves as a great base layer for future skincare steps. Great for summer time because it’s light & effective. 

 Overall: I’m enjoying this product as I have struggled with redness on my cheeks & occasional irritation. This works well with my oily, sensitive, acne prone skin. It’s light, hydrating & soothing without leaving a film or sticky residue."
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Avoid this product. Too many irritants.,"I was excited to review this lotion AKA toner until I found out that it has MANY harmful ingredients, essential oils and comedogenic ingredients. 
I still have it a try, and it broke me out badly. I have skin that can take a punch and don’t break out often, so that’s saying something. It gave me horrible cystic acne all over my cheeks, chin and forehead after only 4 uses. 

Avoid this product. It contains essential oils that are known irritants and can break you out easily or worse.

Also, to the people complaining that this isn’t a lotion, TONERS ARE ALSO CALLED LOTIONS. Expand your knowledge of the things you put on your skin. Lotion does not equal a cream ."

ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Loveee itttt,I absolutely love this product! It left my skin feeling rejuvenated and tightened!
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Origins Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief &amp; Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion - 200ml,Refreshing and soothing lotion that does not dry out my skin. I have had some pretty bad irritation due to  allergies and this has helped to soothe my skin without my skin feeling dry/caked and crusty.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,great product!,I was really excited to receive this product as I was looking for something to help reduce the redness of my skin.  I really like that it was a liquidy consistency as it won't be so heavy during the summer months. I was pleasantly surprised by the texture. It has definitely helped keep my skin hydrated and plump. Definitely reduced the redness on my face. I would recommend this product to friends and family!
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,give this a try!,So when I initially began to sample this product I was very hesitant that it would be something that I would enjoy. I said that only because it’s marketed and listed as a lotion but it very much so has the consistency of my seller water. After about a weeks time I was very happy With how this product helped titan and minimize pores in my T-zone tremendously. Although I do not suffer from red sensitive skin it did help my pores more than almost any product that I’ve ever used. It hasn’t been even two months and I still have a little more than half of the bottle left. This will last me for a long time because it doesn’t take much product.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Very good for redness,I love this product so much . I was introduced to it through bzzagent & it works WONDERSSS
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Yuck,Smells so bad I can’t take the smell i can’t stomach to put in in my face
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Loved it !,I absolutely loved this lotion/ toner it’s super soothing to my skin specially for my sensitive skin. I deal from eczema and dryness as well as skin texture from time to time and this helps so so much
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Origins Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief &amp; Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion - 200ml,Notice a difference in my skins hydration and redness. Love it!
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Origins Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief &amp; Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion - 200ml,"The Origins Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion has now become my go-to treatment skin sensitivity!!! Last week my skin was very irritated and it was all red and patchy which looks awful. However, after replacing my toner with the treatment lotion, the next day my skin was feeling a lot better. EVEN BETTER is after three days of using the lotion, my skin was back to NORMAL!! The lotion does an amazing job calming the skin and helping it to restore resilience . It also helps strengthen your skin barrier against environmental stressors. It was literally all I needed. This has been a life saver! And I also love the scent too (it has a calming herbal smell to it). Will definitely continue to use it as part of my daily routine and 100% recommend!!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Clean and refreshing,"I received Origins: Mega-mushroom relief & resilience soothing treatment lotion a couple of weeks ago. Upon receiving the lotion from Origins, I quickly noticed that the lotion was in liquid form and I started getting skeptical about how it’s supposed to leave my skin moisturized. Upon trying the lotion after cleansing my face, I realized that it’s definitely easier to apply the lotion with a cotton pad than with my hands( which helped retain more of the product). The Origins mega-mushroom relief & resilience soothing treatment lotion has a nice fresh, light scent to it and really feels kind of like water. But leaves a clean refreshing feeling once applied to skin. When I use the lotion my face feels really light but not dry. I like the lotion and have added it to my skincare routine. Just a quick note, if you already have a skincare routine you might experience minor skin purging but it clears up after a few days of continuous use."
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Origins Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief &amp; Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion - 200ml,At first I was taken back by the consistency of this product. I didn’t expect it to be thin but I was also interested and excited to try this product. It’s lightweight and airy on the skin. It moisturized and reduces the redness in my skin. I definitely recommend this.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Origins Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief &amp; Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion - 200ml,I love how gentle this stuff is. It has replaced my regular toner. I have combination skin and did not break out after using. I noticed a huge change in my skin texture. It is a lot more smoother. I use with a cotton pad and follow up with my other skin care products. Would recommend.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Loveloveeee,"I love this treatment lotion!!!!! It doesn't leave a sticky feel afterwards, it drys fast and it makes my face look and feel so soft and smooth!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,"Moisturizing, Light Lotion","I liked the texture of this lotion, it is very light and perfect for a summer skincare routine. I don't like to use products that are thick and heavy during the summer because I feel like they weigh down my skin and do more harm than good. My skin feels instantly hydrated when I use this and it leaves my skin feeling soft."
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,very nice lotion,very good keep your skin smooth .very light on face  will definitely recommend
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Adaptogens for the Skin,"I didn't expect the Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion to be the consistency of a toner versus a lotion; took me by surprise. I received this lotion for free from BzzAgent and Origins. You have to be careful not to waste it since it is on the watery side. It's great at hydrating and softening your skin; it's almost immediate moisturization! My skin drinks it up. This lotion does actually help soothe red, irritated skin. I'm not sure I noticed any reduction in the look of my pores, but I'm starting out with small pores to begin with. My pores are a tiny bit larger on the sides of my nose so I'll continue to use the lotion to see if there's an improvement over months of use. The good thing is that this bottle will last a while. Dermatologists have claimed that the topical use of adaptogens, both licorice root and reishi mushrooms are in this formula, help reinforce and support the skin’s resistance against stressors such as pollution, oxidation, and UV rays which can visibly age your skin. I'm used to ingesting my adaptogens; think ashwargandha, elderberry, ginseng, and moringa powder. It's interesting to have tried them out topically."
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Soothing & cooling,I was surprised about the texture but not in a bad way.  It's more of a liquid lotion than cream and I like that better for the warmer temperatures because other products feel heavy. I don't have the heavy feeling on my skin with this.  It doesn't leave an oily residue and hydrated my skin.  It helped me during the change of weather as my skin gets all crazy but my skin didn't even get close to how it usually gets & I thank this for it.  Definitely going to be picking up more to have my skin ready in September.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Amazing lotion,Love this goes on so nicely! Super soothing and looks great on the skin.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,I loveeeee,"I love its consistency, it's not greasy at all, it's super soft on the skin and a great soother, I've felt my skin softer since the first days of use, my skin is combination and I haven't had a problem with it, other than that smells very good and does not irritate"
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Definitely try,"I'm blown away with this stuff.. I had crazy redness on my skin and was breaking out like mad; which hasn't happened to me in a long time (I'm blaming stress stress stress) I used this one night along with my regular moisturizer (MAKE A DIFFERENCE™ PLUS+ REJUVENATING MOISTURIZER) I went to bed, woke up with all the redness gone 100% gone. I was shocked looked at myself in the mirror for a good 10 minutes redness gone. The acne scars that I had gotten over the few days of my breakouts were incredibly more light and almost completely gone, the breakouts that we're starting to come through the night before those were gone."
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Origins Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief &amp; Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion - 200ml,"It feels nice and doesn’t irritate my skin (which can be sensitive), but I haven’t noticed any huge benefits from using this. I find the “lotion” terminology confusing as well, since it’s more of a toner."
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Origins Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief &amp; Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion - 200ml,I really liked this treatment lotion. It has a great scent and leaves my skin soft and subtle. I use it morning and night and I've noticed it had helped with my oily skin. I strongly recommend.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Great benefits if you can get past the scent,"I use this product in my morning routine. However, the “lotion” is more of a watery substance. It resembles and smells very close to an aftershave according to my husband. He actually enjoys the scent and doesn’t mind using it himself. I love that this is ideal for all skin types since I have sensitive skin and it’s a combination of oily and dry depending on the time of year. I have noticed since using, my dehydrated appearance has looked flawless and more glowing like a sheer healthy shine. It appears and looks smoother too. My pores have diminished in size with continued use. I find that patting this into the skin works best with a cotton ball. Always shake before use! Some of the natural ingredients will settle to the bottom of the bottle. It is very soothing and doesn’t cause any irritation or redness. This product definitely has a gentle formula which I’m pleased with. It’s definitely a product I recommend to both men and women. You can use this in the am and pm but I only started using in the am to allow my skin to adjust to this new product. Overtime I will be adding it into my nightly routine as well. My skin feels so hydrated since I live in a warmer climate so taking care of my skin has always been of importance to me and I couldn’t do it alone without an amazing product like this one by Origins! The only con I have is the scent."
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Origins Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief &amp; Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion - 200ml,"i love using this watery lotion before applying my regular moisturizer, it wets my skin for better absorption and reduces my overall redness. it’s a very gentle and soothing step in my daily routine"
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,"Skin soft, bright and SEXY","This product seems like fragrant water in a plastic bottle but baby, when I tell you this is the ELIXIR, I'm not kidding. I've used this for a few weeks now and my skin is so much smoother, brighter and my pores, which are the biggest on my nose and on my cheeks underneath my eye area, are smaller now. Tip from me: After showering, shake some into your hands and apply this to your face, neck, and decollete while it's damp/wet with your hands, pat in and let it all air dry together. Thank me later!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Great texture and smell,"It is moisturizing and absorbs pretty well. Like others said, it is more like a toner. It reminds me of the japanese moisturizer that I had used. I think from hado labo? But this is way cheaper for sure with similar texture. I will continue using and update if anything changes."
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Origins Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief &amp; Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion - 200ml,ive tired this product a couple times but i can’t necessarily say its made a difference on my skin but its not irritating at all!! i always wish these kinds of products were a little more thicker though! it absorbs pretty quickly
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Very nice but needs more...,"`I loved using this after cleansing! I have oily skin though, and it was not very good with helping with oil control. It did help keep my skin moisturized. Pair this with a product that helps with oil control and it helps the product work better (I used The Ordinary niacinamide drops)"
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Awesome unique product,This product is really awesome. It has a very unique scent - a bit woodsy but clean and pleasant. It feels lovely going on and doesn’t leave an icky feeling after. I use morning and night and my skin feels so much more balanced. It seems to relieve any irritation from any blemishes and helps my skin feel rich and taken care of.

ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Impressed,"This is my first product from Origins. At first when I read lotion, I didn't expect it to be liquid. After using for three weeks, I feel the huge difference. I have a very dry and sensitive skin, and can't use just any product. I love the ingredients of the product. I usually use a cotton ball and than rub my face with it. My skin feels softer and more dewy after using for a few weeks. I recommend trying this product."
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Origins Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief &amp; Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion - 200ml,"In my skincare routine, I typically use essences every day. Despite not being advertised as an essence, I use the Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion as an essence since it prepares the skin for other products. Upon application, my skin feels hydrated. I also notice that my pores are smaller than before using this product. There are also other good skincare products at Origins, including their face mask, which I highly recommend."
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,love it,"I really like it , my skin is soft and hydrated! I did notice a difference on my pores! And I like that the smell is not too overpowering."
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,Canada,Surprisingly Impressed,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I was surprised by the consistency and quality when first trying. It feels more in line with a toner than the advertised lotion but nonetheless have been enjoying this product. My skin feels soft after use and the ingredients do not irritate my skin. Happy with the results so far and my skin feels great.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Meh,It smells great but otherwise it makes me face feel tight and as if there is residue on my face. I dont like it.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Great addition to skincare routine!,"This was initially a really confusing product for me because I was not sure how to use it and was concerned with the fragrance. However, I have KP on my arms and legs and it was super soothing and hydrating for my skin. I really enjoyed it on my body but not on my face!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Origins Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief &amp; Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion - 200ml,"I love this product too much! I use a small amount in my hands and pat it in prior to serum and moisturizer. Hydrating, soothing to my sensitive, dry skin. Sits beautifully under makeup! Gives the skin a plump and youthful glow. Highly recommend!"
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Origins Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief &amp; Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion - 200ml,I was surprised by the consistency when first trying this product. It is marketed as a lotion but in my opinion it is more like a toner. It is very liquidy. Nevertheless it works extremely well. After a two weeks continued regular use i can see a difference in the appearance of my combination mildly sensitive skin and the texture. My skin feels softer than before and it has calmed the redness i experience on my cheeks.i also like that this didn’t make my skin feel sticky and that it wasn’t overly fragranced.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Nice addition,This was overall a nice addition to my skincare routine! I noticed it helped in redness in my skin and was definitely hydrating. It reached well to my skin and felt like a lotion but in such a light form.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Must have for stressed out skin,I'm going through alot these days ever since discovering my kid has to start chemo. My skin was totally out of control with breakouts non stop and didn't help that I kept picking my skin out of stress. Was happy to try out the Origins Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion. It really helped soothe my skin when I needed it the most and I noticed my pores started shrinking. Love the ingredients aswell especially since I'm making an effort to go cleaner these days. Highly recommend this lotion.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Origins Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief &amp; Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion - 200ml,This mega mushroom relief lotion is so good. I use it morning and night as a serum to help relief my skin irritation. It helps smooth out the skin as well it serves as a hydrated lotion which is important because I can definitely get some dry spot on my skin. The lotion itself is lightweight and at the beginning it has a light scent that disappears within a few minutes. Overall I’d definitely continue using it.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Great soothing lotion,"I love this lotion! I was expecting it to be a little bit thicker since it is described as lotion, but I use it more like an astringent, applying it on a cotton ball and then rubbing my face with it. I like to use it at night time as the night cream. It moisturizes my face well and calms down the breakouts/redness over night. I would definitely  recommend this to anyone who has breakouts and dry skin."
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Origins Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief &amp; Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion - 200ml,"I was very surprised by this product. With the name ‘treatment lotion’ I wasn’t expecting this to be more of a toner/essence formulation (not the brands fault, just me not paying attention). I typically feel like products like this are gimmicky, but I really did enjoy the extra punch of hydration from using this, and it did seem to help with some of the redness I occasionally get on my cheeks."
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Very calming,This feels very nice and soothing. It has a slight cooling effect and calms my skin. I like to put this on a cotton round and press it into my face. I really like the smell too.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Good Product,I started using the product by applying some product on a cotton pad and applied it on my skin in the morning and nights. I have a lot of redness on my face and I’m always looking for a product to help reduce my redness. This product did work a little but not a lot. I didn’t see much results with my pores to minimize. It did leave my face hydrated which is important since I have dry skin. The smell wasn’t too overwhelming. Overall this product was okay since I didn’t see major results
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Like but made me more red.,Im not sure how I feel about this product yet since it made my skin more red when I initially applied the product. After using it for a minute I feel like I have seen a difference in redness but still a little bit concerned when I see the first redness thats just my skin tho. I'm not sure if I'd keep using this or if I'd buy again.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Nice and Cooling!,Very soothing and calmed down a lot of my redness and oily skin. Helped control problem areas while still being hydrating and cooling. Fragrance isn't overbearing as well.
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Great Soothing Treatment,"It's important to note that this more of a toner than a lotion. I was not expecting this product to be so water-like in texture but once I got use to it, I really liked it. This product felt so soothing on my skin."
ORIGINS-Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion,USA,Origins Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins™ Mega-Mushroom Relief &amp; Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion - 200ml,I received the Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion for reviewing purposes. I find the lotion to be an overall good product. It helps cleanse the face for your serums and moisturizer. The smell of the product isn't my favorite but it not overwhelming. I do feel like it gives a plumps to my skin. I use it morning and night. With my skin being on the more sensitive side it doesn't upset my skin. I find the price to be fair for the amount of product you do get. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try it.
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Concentrated Brightening Glycolic Essence,Australia,Nice but not perfect,I have bought this full size product as I tried sample size before and loved it. I am not sure if the ingredients have changed or it might be due to longer usage but my skin is getting irritaded when I use it each day for a longer period of time. It has nice smell and works well however can not be used on a daily basis.
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Concentrated Brightening Glycolic Essence,Australia,toner,"The product is exactly as described, gentle, hydrating & refreshing on the skin with a nice light fragrance. I use it at night with the Caudalie dark spot correcting night cream, & in the daytime with the Nuxe SPF20 anti dark spot moisturiser which work together very well."
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Concentrated Brightening Glycolic Essence,Malaysia,Repurchase of VinoPerfect essence,I use this product during my trip to Paris. I like it so much and recently found out Sephora had carry this product line. This cost performance is high compare to other branded essence. 
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Concentrated Brightening Glycolic Essence,Malaysia,The Essence,Pertama pakai essence yg cepat meresap ke muka. Baru guna setakat x nampak sgt perubahan tp selesa guna. Tunggu dlm brp bln nnt mungkin ada perubahan. Cuma harga agak mahal walaupun beli time sale.

Good value for money as well"
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Concentrated Brightening Glycolic Essence,Singapore,Great toner!,"Very soothing on the skin! Woke up next day and my face felt super hydrated and smooth. However, there was an slight sticky feeling after i applied it on but all was good after applying my moisturiser. "
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Concentrated Brightening Glycolic Essence,New Zealand,didn’t like it,This is the most useless skincare product I’ve ever bought I don’t see any difference at all it’s like wetting my face abit with water..never wasting my money on this ever again 
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Concentrated Brightening Glycolic Essence,Singapore,"light essence, pleasant smell","tried the other Caudalie essence previously and i must say this one smells more pleasant! haven't been using it daily but every other day, perhaps that's why i can't say it has brightened my dark spots, but it is very moisturing indeed! "
CAUDALIE-Vinoperfect Concentrated Brightening Glycolic Essence,Philippines,Love Caudalie! ,All of the products that I’ve tried from Caudalie is perfect for my skin! Their products are gentle on the skin and the scent is gentle too! This essence is no exception to that! I’ve been using their products for almost 3 years now and I have no regrets! ❤️
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Singapore,Mdm,Feel that the cream based retinol might be better prefer the pixi glow instead of retinol tonic. Not a difference on skin or smaller pores like a cream retinol would give however no peeling though after use 
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,New Zealand,Nice little tonic!,"A really nice way to get your retinol in there, I love this toner compared to other retinol serums I’ve used, seems less abrasive and harsh on my skin. Delivers a nice glow to the skin. "
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Singapore,cleared my milia,"i wanted to try chemical peels to clear my forehead milia, its a big insecurity of mine so i decided to try this out first instead since my skin is not used to chemical exfoiliants. im so grateful to say this worked in less than a week, my forehead is almost completely smooth.. as for other problems on my face like hyperpigmentation or scars etc ive yet to see improvements, maybe after longer use :)
"
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,Nothing special,There is nothing special about this toner and cant see any differences at all. I've always used their glow toner and that one is the best. Sadly this one doesn't do anything to my face.
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,Product that I would repeatedly purchase ,I have been using this for about more than 3 months now. It’s keep my skin clean and clears the pigments. Worth your money and I would try the other range in this brand soon. 
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,holy grail! ,"Breakout is a nightmare... Had to tried a few brand, a few remedies to saved my face... Lol.. And i found this.. Thank god, retinol is a holy grail... Never ever want to try other brand even a way cheaper.. Apply just for 2 3 times a week... Save your money... And your beauty is prevail... "
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,Will not re-purchased,"Many people recommended this retinol on Tiktoks, but the effect not so good. I have finished 1 bottle and will not re-purchased. "
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Singapore,Don't bother,Honestly does nothing - not even sure if it has any benefits as a toner but it hasn't helped to improve my skin in any way. Retinol products being stored in a clear bottle may also ring a few alarm bells. NEXT!
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Singapore,ok ok,"you can see the retinol working and it has a very cooling feeling when you apply it to your skin, the retinol works quite while! this product can be used daily and it won’t harm your skin barrier or anything

"
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,Nice product,I tried glow tonic toner before and I love it then I decided to try retinol toner and i love this toner too. Recommended to oily and combination skin.
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,Didn’t really do much ,"I bought this because I heard that it’s a great product to start for those whom are starting out retinol for the first time. However, I feel like it didn’t do much for my skin. I finished the whole bottle and yet I saw no changes. I don’t know if it’s just me 🤷🏻‍♀️"
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,great amd ok,Nice price but I don’t really like the fact that it is water based which makes it not easy to apply. But fast results and I will be purchasing it again
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,Not so sure,Not much effect on me.
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Philippines,great for dark spots,I use it to lighten dark spots from my break outs. I must also share it's not stingy and safe for bum use to lighten it.
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Philippines,Effective,"Like the Glow Tonic, this one also had a good effect on my skin. I love using this toner once or twice a week, especially on days where I feel like my skin feels heavy – will re-purchase again and see if I'll continue with this or go back to the glow tonic "
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,best tonic,"today received, at night used.. i fall in love.. love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love sephora"
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,Not so great,"A basic toner. With this price, theres tons of better toner alternative out there. My advice spend a lil bit more than this to get a better product or just go for k-beauty toner. They have amazing tons of choices from "
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,like it,I started using retinol for the past one year. Liked what it did to my skin. Good that now this retinol comes in a bigger bottle.                                         
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,Using with caution ,"First time introducing retinol into my skincare so I decided to start with this product since reviews claimed it is mild. After a week, breakouts started happening at the mouth area & hasn’t stopped since. My skin is usually acne-free. Acne still popping out now before the old ones clear. 

I have stopped using this for now till breakouts clear up. I may or may not try using again in slower moderation. "
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,Retinol tonic,"I bought it just for having a try initially but I feel that it works nothing on my face. However, I will give a try to repurchase it and try it again."
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Singapore,average,expected more given that it’s a retinol product. personally experienced more glow using their glow tonic. this felt slightly too drying at times. suitable for retinol beginners
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,repeat twice ," I was sceptical that this would be as good as it claims at first, but I am so glad I purchased this as it is now my go-to tonic. I’ve tried so many different products to try and calm down the acne and marks on my face with no luck until this one. I use it after cleansing and my acne has cleared up so much and I’ve only been using it for three weeks (twice a day). Would highly recommend, finally feeling more confident in my skin"
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Singapore,no feel,Didn’t notice any result that the retinol ingredient here promise to deliver. It is an ordinary toner. Luckily bought the smaller size to try. Recommend everyone to try with the smaller bottle first in case you don’t like it.
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Singapore,no change to my enlarged pores ,"I suffer from enlarged pores on my nose and I use this item with drunk elephant tlc glycolic night serum to work on my enlarged pores on the nose. Sad to say, there has been no change in my enlarged pores and I did not feel any other difference on the other days of the face and neck after using it day in and day out. Won’t be purchasing again. "
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,a bit expensive for a very small size,Im a bit shock because i dont expect it to be really in small size and a bit weird for a 100ml to be this small bottle? i compare with my other makeup with 100ml and a bit contra between them. a bit expensive for a small size of 100ml to be rm70. ive not tried yet but hope it will go well with my skin

PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Singapore,Mild but it works,"Three weeks into using this, my skin was glowing! It did not have the side effects of retinol that I usually hear about but it might be because it’s lower in dosage. 
Great for those who wants to start anti-aging products young!"
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,Good product ,Have tried retinol and glow. Retinol is better for my skin as glow leaves skin feeling quite dry. Retinol seems to hydrate the skin and makeup goes on smoothly after use.

PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,Holy grail!,"I used Retinol Tonic after my skin started to heal from a terrible breakout and somehow this retinol tonic helped in smoothing my skin texture!

PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Singapore,Fast Absorb,"I still love Glow tonic compared to this one. What I like about this product is that when you apply it, and then you apply your other creams, it will be more effective. "
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,pixi retionol tonic,the toner doesn't stings my skin..and i apply it every night..it more to the mild side..and it has lavender fragrance..soo can be therapeutic when u apply it before sleeping

PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,not too sure,Bought this for my mom as I see retinol ingredient. But I didn't notice any obvious improvements on her skin. Probably has to try for longer period or full range of retinol products to see the impact 
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Singapore,Great for beginner,"This is my first retinol product, so far so good, easy to use and great for sensitive skin! Will repurchase when I used up! Hopefully this can reduce my acne marks!

PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,Nice but nothing special,"I prefer the glow tonic better than this one, But 
that’s only my personal opinion. However it does 
not irritating my skin at all. So i dont regret having this in my collection to try."
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,so so,I have a oily and combination skin. I bought this during Sephora sale. I don’t really like the stinging feel after applying the tonic on my face. And it is a bit pricey. Won’t consider to repurchase again in the future. 
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,SPECIAL FOR FINE LINES,"Bought for my sister’s friend. She said this tonic suitable on her skin. Suitable for fine lines, wrinkles & anti ageing. It’s also makes your skin hydrating & feel smooth. "
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Australia,Night time use,I use this tonic as my night time toner. I like the scent however I still prefer the Glow Tonic to the Retinol Tonic. I don't think I will purchase this again once I'm done.
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Australia,So refreshing,This toner is so refreshing...I used to use a spray toner as I found that worked better for my skin. I was worried about having to use a cotton pad to apply it but it is so worth it for the reset my skin gets in my skin care regime. 
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Singapore,Good,"I have not seen much difference in my skin maybe because I’m still young for retinol. So, I gave it to my Mum and there’s a difference in hers. The wrinkles got better."
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Singapore,Retinol Tonic,"Pixi Retinol Tonic
Fragrance isn't strong and most importantly it is value for money. It will be great if Pixi comes out with more gift sets, it allow customers to try out more products before buying the actual items."
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Singapore,tonic ,"I use this at night and in the morning my skin is glowing this is really good start this at 30 and the delay the signs of ageing ,, good price and great product  "
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Malaysia,Retinol Tonic,Good. Will repurchase until my love for it fades away. This is a thick consistency toner but doesnt feel heavy on the skin. Does not cause any breakout either. Pair it with Inkey List AHA Serum and moisturizer. You will have a glowing skin!
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Singapore,Strongly recommended,"Skin glowed, age spots lightened and fine lines disappeared after using. Strongly recommended for ladies with age spots and fine lines at forehead. Use it with Pixi Glow Tonic for better results. "
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Singapore,Retinol,I first use this product since I read about retinol when I reached the age of 30. I only using this during night and it gives me that morning freshness and glow. Also recommended to my friends and they thank me for introducing this toner to them.

around once to twice a week depending on how my skins feeling. I wasnt expecting to enjoy using as did have a reaction to their glow tonic however I've been really pleased with the results and comfort of my skin when using. Doesn't really tingle but my skin definitely looks brighter and smoother from using. This I would recommend for any skin, especially those concerned with dullness/ageing. Important to wear spf whilst using!"

PIXI-Retinol Tonic,,Not bad,"I gave this 3 stars as I have not noticed a significant difference in my skin. Compare with another glow tonic, this one it's not that amazed me.
For this price point, I may consider other products when this is finished."
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,,Did not do much,This toner did not provide any results even after 3 months of regular use. It could be because the concentration of retinol is low. Better off trying something else. Would not repurchase
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,,mr,just an ordinary toner. as what i said in the other variant. you get what you paid for. did nothing on my skin. in fact its quite drying. not a fan. wont repurchase. 
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,,not sure,Tengok review not bad jugak i decide untu try la.. mula mula nampak ok.. tapi lama lama i perasan kulit i macam makin kasar dan pore makin besar.. so i terpaksa stop sebab takut makin kasar. 
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,Singapore,item received ,"Pixi Retinol tonic, love this product my skin feels soft and clean after used and it makes my skin glowy, fresh and radiant and im using this retinol tonic for almost a year...Repeatedly ordered"
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,,"nice smell, price increases! ","Very gentle and effective tonic water. It moisturises and renews skin gently. Only need small drops application. But don't mix with acids products. That's the law. If not, please don't blame the product for ineffectiveness! "
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,,Good but...,There are many benefits of Retinol to the skin. I bought this because of those benefits. Whilst it doesn't feel as good as the Glow tonic the toner does still do the job. 
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,,came highly recommended ,First time user. It’s light and I feel no tightness on my already really dry skin. Happy with my purchase and I really like the light jasmine flower scent. 
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,,Really liked it,"I already finished my bottle and now currently waiting to finish up my 2nd bottle of Pixi Glow Tonic. Between the two, I will definitely choose the Retinol Tonic over the other. Works well on my combination skin. Smells nice too. "
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,,Just so so and not that great.,Just normal. Didn't feel much difference after using for 3 weeks++. But it does brightens but not hydrating. No idea what the fuss it is about. Don't plan to repurchase. 
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,,Not bad,"Don’t really see much of difference on my skin. As a retinol product, I’m just using this to keep my skin plump. It’s gentle and absorbs quickly. Overall not a bad product. "

"

So that i can stay look young forever. huhuhuhuhu"
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,,love it,bought this because caroline hirons recommended it. Love love love it. great if you want to try retinols but dont want something too harsh. will definitely purchase again.
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,,A Quite Decent Product,This tonic does not makes my skin breaks out. But it doesn't makes my skin any better. But surely this freshen my skin after washing up. Guess I have to try the Glow tonic later. 
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,,me,"Really mediocre, did not see any differences but the product smells nice. It’s quite gentle but just not very sure if there were any effects from retinol. "
PIXI-Retinol Tonic,,Matt Goss recommended,I bought this after watching the review in which Matt goss used it together with the glow tonic. Have been using this for a week and up to this point i dont have any allergy reactions whatsoever. I have dry to normal skin

OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner (Christmas Limited Edition),Canada,addicted,I absolutely fell in love with this product. The smell is beyond amazing and works so good!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner (Christmas Limited Edition),Canada,Heavenly,I’ve been using this for about 2 weeks and I already notice my skin looks brighter and feels smoother. The smell Is heavenly which is an extra bonus.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner (Christmas Limited Edition),Canada,The perfect toner,Love this toner.  It does add a glow to your skin.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner (Christmas Limited Edition),Canada,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner (Holiday Limited Edition),"Doesn't work at all. I noticed no difference on my dark spots, even though I used the whole bottle."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner (Christmas Limited Edition),Canada,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner (Christmas Limited Edition),Love this. Saw a difference in my skin within a day or two. Tried it first as a sample and knew I had to get the full size product.
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Singapore,Ms,An ok toner but nothing so special about it. Can find something else but better in the same price range.
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,Good thing takes time,"Almost gave up the remaining quarter of the first bottle after I didnt see any changes to my skin.. stopped using it till one day I was out in the sun the whole day, and used this to Spritz my face (of course I had my sunscreen on). Not only it helped hydrate and soothe my skin, my complexion returned back to normal the next day.. as if I never been out in the sun. Continued buying it since then. Also noticed My skin feeling supple and pores size reduced. On my third bottle now. "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Indie Lee CoQ-10 Toner - 125ml,It’s great for a quick morning routine. Won’t hurt sensitive skin. Can’t tell a huge difference in my skin.
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,Great product,"Can’t staple toner. It’s a lovely toner which helps your serums apply easier, very refreshing can’t go wrong. Just spray it into your hands that way it goes a bit further. 

"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,coq-10,"I bought this because I love their balancing cleanser so i wanna use the same range for toner. But unfortunately its not suitable for my face especially at dry area. Nonetheless, its easier to apply just spray it!"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,changed my skin forever,"I have combo, sensitive, acne-prone skin and this has been my HOLY GRAIL. Since using this (I’m on my 5th bottle now), my skin has cleared up so much and my skin barrier has been balanced. At night, I spray directly on my face after washing with cleanser and I don’t wipe the access away and let it absorb before doing the rest of my routine. In the morning I spray it on and wipe my face with a cotton round. I think by using this in place as a cleanser in the morning has what’s made the most difference. Although it’s a little pricey, it goes a longggg way, even after using a generous amount every morning AND night. I’ll never stop buying! Thank you Indie Lee for this product and making me confident in my skin again!!!"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,Err,Not sure what’s the fuss is all about. It was okay. Did nothing much. Won’t repurchase. Price point was not doing good either. Gonna find something else much better. 
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,Soothing toner ,"This is a soothing toner with a light artificial perfume scent. It’s not bad. It’s calming but for the ingredients offered, the price is not worth it. "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Singapore,Perfect Toner,"This is the best toner that I have used so far. To me, it removes remnants of dirt or residue not removed by cleanser and facial wash. It primed the skin for serum and whatever regime that follows as they get absorbed rapidly. Recommend to all beautiful looking for vegan toner.  Give it a try. You will not regret it."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,hydrating & light,"Tried them as it went on sale. Its hydrating but i dont like the sticky after effect. Leaves a slight tingling sensation, but if wiped off properly, it is good enough for its price"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Singapore,Meh,"Meh. This did nothing for my skin. I've seen more noticeable results with drugstore brands. The good thing is that this didn't break me out. Won't be repurchasing, even if it's on sale."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,Just Okay,"I like the hydrating ingredients in this product, but the thing that let's it down is the mister-it comes out in thick bursts rather than a nice mist. I have even tried more affordable brands with a better mister so although the formula is what I want in a hydrating product it's not very nice to apply. "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Singapore,not drying,love the clean ingredient list! doesn't feel drying but would love for it to be a bit more hydrating. works best for me when my skin is damp. love that that is no strong alcohol smell unlike most other toners
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Singapore,i think...,the annoying part abt indie lee's products is they are indeed too strong in smells regardless of the natural claims. it seems like the only item im fine with is the brightening cleanser. though yes it still smell !!! so i can hardly use this product. bought a few other kits thinking it may really do wow to skin but those who are smell sensitive like me. pls avoid
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Miracle in a bottle!,"Not only does this act as amazing toner that calms redness and smooths texture, it hydrates and soothes the skin. I tell people it’s an all in one. I’ve seen a big difference in my skin since using and I’m never stopping!"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,Good toner,"Smells goos 
Pump aesy to use
Absorb to ur skin better After other toner it mean double toner u can not use serum after use this. Very moisture"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,OMG this is so good!!!,I love the smell of this product. Fragrance scent of this toner. Light weight on my skin. Feeling fresh no doubt about it. Would love to repeat purchase once it’s back in stock ! 
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,Hydrating mist,"This toner was great for keeping my skin hydrated and for refreshing it throughout the day, but I didn’t notice any skincare benefits or effects beyond that. It felt really nice on the skin, but there are definitely more affordable options out there that have the same effect. "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,Ms. ,"The cap tends to become loose. I lost half the bottle because of this. Very poor packaging. As for the product itself, it’s an okay product. I wouldn’t recommend buying the product. "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Indie Lee CoQ-10 Toner - 125ml,Miracle for dry skin. I spritz between moisturizers and my skin drinks it up. I think of it more as a moisture mist than a traditional toner. Also love that it’s a glass bottle and I can apply without wasting cotton rounds!
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Holy Grail!!,"This products is amazing. Coq-10 is an antioxidant that helps to fight free radicals in the skin. This product is not meant to show immediate results, but to fight sun damage and signs of aging so you’ll see results over time."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Holy Grail!,"If you are browsing this product…..just go ahead and buy it, there will be no regrets I promise! I never want to be without this. It’s perfect. It’s great as a toner, setting spray and to use between serums!"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Indie Lee CoQ-10 Toner - 125ml,"Feels very refreshing on my skin and I noticed an immediate shrinking on my pores. Very hydrating which is essential for my extremely dry skin, and left my skin very soft."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Refreshing and brightening!,"This is honestly the first non-exfoliating toner that I’ve tried in years (maybe ever?) and I am so in love. I have weirdo combination skin that’s more prone to dryness than oiliness, but it’s still super easy for my pores to become clogged. I have also suffered from terrible hormonal acne breakouts for nearly a decade. This toner is hydrating without clogging, totally refreshing, and brightening to my skin! It’s a super effective gentle contrast to the more exfoliating products in my skincare routine. I am already on my second bottle and I really love it!"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Setting Spray and Face Toner!!!,"Because this toner does not contain alcohol, it does NOT dry out your skin....So my secret weapon is also using this toner as a setting spray. And let me tell you, it makes my skin so glowy and hydrated with or without makeup on! it's probably because of the added hyaluronic acid! 

This has been working better for me as a setting spray than anything I've ever used! I also spray it on pre-makeup and let it set in while I do my eyebrows. It's soooooo good. I have dry combo acne prone skin, so its hard to find things that work well for my entire face, this has been a real game changer."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,toner,light scent with refreshing light application. Can be used regularly throughout the day without any sticky feeling. Good bargain as purchased on sale. 
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Singapore,love it,"First got a smaller version of this to try, really love how it keeps my skin hydrated and is suitable for sensitive skin. Bought the bigger version on sale "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Singapore,Feel sticky ,I don't like it. Feel sticky after use. Throw it away 
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,My Favourite,This one is my back to back toner. Sometimes I alternate it with other toner. But this toner really works well on my sensitive and combo skin. Really love how soft my skin is and the smell is really amazing. So refreshing. Love it. Just a bit pricey though. 
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,Mrs ,"Love indie lee products my first time using 
them but had no bad break outs ever so gently on my face love it I’m so pleasantly surprised wish I got bigger size those are too small "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,"great product, strong spray bottle ",I love this product. It left my skin hydrated and refreshed and plump. The only thing I didn’t like was the mist pump. I got the small bottle version and the spray was too forceful to spray directly onto my face. The large size spray bottle is much better.
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,review ,"didnt do much for me, smelt bad "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Singapore,love this! ,"Giving this 4.5 stars due to price point. It’s quite pricy for such a small amount of product. But it works great! Keeps my skin smooth and hydrated, definitely recommend it "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,great toner,Very happy with this product. Perfect size for travel and great quality. I use this in combination with the Indie Lee cleanser and it leaves me with glowing skin!
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,A++,I enjoy spritzing my face with this toner and the scent is pleasant. After cleansing this toner re-hydrates my skin and is gentle. I love this toner and gone through at least 3 bottles with 1 ready to go.
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,Refreshing great toner ,I like refreshing smell and teksture of this toner . after used this toner I can feel my skin moisture lock and not sticky on my skin . I am sure will repurchase again . 
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,My bestfriend.,"Best toner hands down!
I’ve used so many toners from other high quality clean beauty brands and this one by far is the best one if you have sensitive skin and is dry thennn don’t waste your time give this bby a try.
I’m on my 7th bottle oh and if it’s a fit I recommend buying multiple whenever there’s a sale."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,Not really doing what it says,"I like the ingredients and it was pretty nice to use. However I don't think this product is hydrating/soothing, and it's always difficult to see the antioxydant effect. Not going to use it again"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,Love,"This is such a great natural toner for the skin when looking for something clean, gentle and suitable for acne prone skin. Smells great, hydrating and soothing. Highly recommend!"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Singapore,love this,"I love this toner packaging as spray. The smell is nice, quick absorbent and most of it all works well before layering all my other skincare routine.
"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,So refreshing!,Absolutely love. Switched to this after my skin needed a break from actives and I needed something soothing and hydrating. Has helped calm my skin so well. Keeps it in check. Smells lovely. Recommend.
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,must by for a simple clean skincare routine,"Probably the single most important item in my skin care routine. Evens tone, increases brightness and hydration. Just perfect. I just spray on and leave it, so no added cotton use. The literal only drawback is the price for how long the bottle lasts (not too long for me), but I can’t even knock off a star for that since it lives up to the price."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Singapore,best toner ever,"Finally found a toner that is suitable for my skin. I have oily-combination skin. And this toner improves my skin’s complexion. Been using this for over 6 months now. Refreshing, gentle and works well for me. Just that the “spray” / applicator sprays quite a lot and one press. I didn’t want to waste so I  spray directly on my face, then use a cotton pad around my face instead. "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Canada,A toner that does something!,"Alright, so I am aware that most toners do absolutely nothing for acne, or even anything at all really, but surprisingly, I found this one to be pretty hydrating. I am also in love with the scent of it! I‘ve been using it for about two weeks now, and I am not disappointed so far. I am currently using Glossier‘s Milky Jelly Cleanser, and I am finding it to be a little drying, but after applying this toner, my face doesn‘t feel firm or dry at all. I‘d recommend this toner as a second step for those who use a stripping/drying cleanser."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,the best really good ,This toner can be use as a setting spray before makeup or after. I recommend and prefer to use before makeup Its will make your skin more nice afterwards. Its a good product hand down the best spray application i ever used. The the smell is soo good. 
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Must try and buy!,I am new to using toners. I got this in mini size in a beauty box. I used it a few times not thinking it was really going to do much but it's amazing and I find myself always wanting to use it. it makes your face look and feel perfect and it keeps it feeling that way all day. great for sensative skin too.. Definitely buy!
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,Love!,Tried a small bottle of this toner and loved it! It smells almost medicinal yet quite relaxing? Doesn’t dry you up. It helps to set a great base for the next products you’ll apply 
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,it’s alright,"I love their brightening cleanser and I thought I’d give this a shot - it’s fine I guess. It works just like any other toner - no major reaction to my skin, which I like. But I think for now, I’ll just stick to the cleanser only. "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,not bad,"All good, freshen up the face and smells nice. One star left bcs it’s not extraordinary. Can easily find a replacement. I might repurchase if its on sale. ———————————————————————-"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,Just ok,"I don't know what it does to my skin..Same like Mario Badescu toner.. idk what it does. Honestly, this one only good for skin prep before heavy skincare routine. But, do it need to be in my many steps night skincare routine? Mostly no. So if you wanna give it a try, buy small one first. Also note that it has herbal smell. If you not a fan of scent in skincare might wanna avoid."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,New Zealand,I keep coming back to this onw,This is a regular re-purchase for me. I love mist toners and this one especially. It has a gorgeous scent and Ilthe company's values really align with my own.
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,therapeutic non irritating ,"Loses a star bc the mist is worse in the full size. Th mist is super calming, smells great but not too fragranced, easy to use after skincare steps….."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,Smells strange,Bought the mini size toner to try out because of its good reviews from others. I love other Indie Lee’s products but this toner had a strange scent of temple incense. Would not repurchase solely due to the scent.
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,Not sure what the hype is?,"This didn’t do anything for me unfortunately, seemed just like expensive water. The bottle is cute and the spray was fairly fine, but that’s about it. I gave it to my sister "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Indie Lee CoQ-10 Toner - 125ml,You need this toner the best!! It does exactly as it mentions and more it leaves me plump
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Holy Grail,"I have repurchased this so many times I’ve lost count. It is a holy grail staple in my skin care routine!! I use it between cleansing and serums. Some days I only use this after cleansing and can go about my day still feeling hydrated, and I feel a noticeable difference if I ever skip on this. I personally love the smell. I spray it all over my face and it absorbs quickly and leaves me feeling refreshed! I’ll use this forever and ever."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,NOTICABLE DIFFERENCE,"i never noticed a different in toners, with this one it’s undeniable. skin looks and feels so good after using it. i’m on bottle number 3 and that’s from someone who never saw i use for toner their whole 23 years of life!"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,Refreshing toner but I don't like the smell,This comes in a matte glass bottle so it's a little heavy to bring around. I like that it's in a spray / mist form so I don't need to use cotton pads to apply this toner and can directly spray it on my face. However it has a very strong smell that resembles the the burning of incense at temples so I'm not a fan of it. 
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,Super refreshing!,"Really like this product as it feels so refreshing + moisturising! I have dry skin and it works fine. It does give me a glow to my skin which is also another win. 
"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,Average toner,"My first purchase, and while it works well as a toner, I wasn’t wowed by it. Hydrating, somewhat yes; softer skin, maybe. Didn’t see or feel there was a major improvement. "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,hands down favorite toner!!!,"I have been trying a lot of hydrating toners recently, and this is been my absolute favorite. I look forward to using this everyday!!!  It’s easy to layer and feels so cooling and calming because of the cucumber.  The glass packaging is superb. I do wish the sprayer was a little more fine but I rated it 5 stars anyways because of how the formula feels.  I know the price point is high but honestly it’s so worth it because of how much I enjoy using this. It would be cool if they made a refill size if they wanted to be environmentally friendly."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,Calming hydration in a bottle,"I love this product so much, and have done so for years. My skin feels hydrated, calmed, and generally happy post-use (also great for mid-day hydration too-ups)."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,New Zealand,So good - but buy the bigger one ,"My dry / combo skin really responded well to this toner. It left my skin feeling very hydrated  and soothed. 

I love that this one is alcohol free!

My only downfall is I bought the 30ml which didnt last me long at all. Next time I will definitely go for the 125ml "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Indie Lee CoQ-10 Toner - 125ml,"It smells nice and is hydrating. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is the packaging, I wish the spray mist was finer. This is one of the most hydrating toners that I’ve tried."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Singapore,I pair it with the brightening cleanser,I think this is an alright product.  have sensitive skin and this product does not have harsh ingredients which lead me to buy this product. My skin looks brighter now. 
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Philippines,philippines,I don’t know what exactly it does for my skin but it is refreshing to use after a workout or to cool down on a hot day. The slim spray bottle is convenient to carry around in one’s bag!
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Indie Lee CoQ-10 Toner - 125ml,"Not a fan of the scent of this but it works great! It doesn’t feel sticky and it makes my skin feel hydrated & prepped for serums and moisturizer. Also, I haven’t had one pimple since I started using this and the brightening cleanser. I will repurchase this product."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Holy Grail Toner,"I’ve tried so many different toners that do different things, but this is the one I keep coming back to. I think I’m on my 4th bottle. CoQ-10 is a great antioxidant for skin. This toner soothes and hydrates, so if that’s what you’re looking for in your toner, this is the one."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,Really Nice ,Really loving this toner. I ultimately purchased for the CoQ10 as l thought it was a great way to incorporate into my routine & l like toners that include beneficial ingredients. This doesn't disappoint & l love spritzing this just out the shower after cleansing. Would repurchase again. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the spritz being a bit direct rather than misty.  
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,"Amount scam! only 4.2 onces, standard is 6.5!","This is a glass bottle I am clumsy so I put it in another container in the picture. The bottle is almost all glass and makes you think it has a normal amount! Wow did they scam you I looked at all my pricey toners from Sephora and they all had around 6.5-6.75 oz of toner, this has only 4.2! Also it’s breakable glass, if you are clumsy look out!"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Not worth the cost,"I was excited to try this because I loved the matching cleanser but honestly I don't think it is anything special considering the cost. The smell is nice and it feels refreshing on my skin. I don't use it as a toner anymore, but as a ""midday"" spray on days I don't do my make-up. I won't buy again."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Great toner,I like the glass bottle packaging. 1 spray distributes a good amount of toner on to the face. I love using this toner as part of my morning routine.
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,YES,I received this as a sample and used it day and night until the sample ran out. I have been desperately searching for a solid skincare routine and since I started using this - I feel as though my other products have started working better? If that makes sense! I just ordered a full size and CAN'T WAIT for it to get here. I've never used a toner before and is this what I have been missing in my routine all my life?!
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,INDIE LEE  CoQ-10 Toner  125ml,"I absolutely love this. It made my skin feels clean. 
Moreover, it's clean, and no harmful chemicals - that is super important. It might also seems a little pricy, but personally I always believe that if a product serves you well, and no side effects, it's worth while.  I do not like to spurge myself in crazy designer clothes or stuff. I think having good skin not only comes from a certain product (s) we use, but is also what we eat.  I would definitely get another when I run low on this product. & I hope Sephora will continue to carry this particular brand. "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Philippines,Love this,"I actually really love this but gave this 4 stars due to the price. I find it quite expensive for a toner, but it does its job. It's not drying, nor does it feel oily. "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Indie Lee CoQ-10 Toner - 125ml,I do not like the smell. Also my skin started to breakout slightly after each use. I have very dry skin. This product may  not have been appropriate for me
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,Love the smell so much!!!,"Everytime I sprit this on my face, I instantly feel calm & it’s like I am at a spa. This replaces any toner. It makes face feels hydrated. Will definitely repurchase! Just fyi, it comes in a glass bottle. "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Indie Lee CoQ-10 Toner - 125ml,I love it but please take out the sage and the bitter orange oil out of the formula. Thanks
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Indie Lee CoQ-10 Toner - 125ml,I’m on my second bottle of this stuff and my skin just soaks it in! I use it twice a day after cleansing. I spray it on my face and they pat pat it in. Before it dries and my face is still a little damp I’ll add my serum. Very calming and soothing for my sensitive skin.
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,"Not great, not bad","This is average. It's adequate. If you need something simple it's fine. but it doesn't do anything special, and for that it's expensive when it doesn't do anything stand out or have stand out ingredients"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Indie Lee CoQ-10 Toner - 125ml,Has a bad fragrance smell.. It’s an okay toner but there are definitely better ones
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Perfect toner!,"Very soothing, hydrating, and refreshing. Great for my acne prone skin! All around great toner, can't wait to try more from this brand"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Singapore,great product,Was sceptical at first because i don't trust products with fragrance but this was really one of a kind would purchase it again if I'm not broke lolkjnj
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Beauty with Humanity,"When I read a little further into the ingredients and discovered that they're not only all natural and very morally friendly, but that the founder's mission behind this line is to create products that are safe to put on our skin because of their own experiences overcoming health issues, it made me love this product even more. A lot of the creators behind beauty products today are celebrities while this brand is more about the ingredients than the glam. I'm thankful the owner has taken the time to put together such friendly products that won't harm us, especially considering how our largest organ is our skin. Also, it feels AMAZING! There is no better spray bottle and I ran out quickly from using it all over. It's a wonderfully soothing toner / mist and a great addition to any skincare routine."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Good enough / expensive,"I love this toner. It is very light and moisturizing formula that does not irritate my combination skin. I have not seen a drastic change in my skin since I began using this but I like it enough to repurchase. I do not care for how expensive this product is. If I find something that is similar for a cheaper price, I will probably switch."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Canada,Indie Lee CoQ-10 Toner - 125ml,"Great toner, really refreshing and hydrating. I also love toners that come in spray bottles, so you don't have to worry about wasting cotton pads."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,skin,"Ive never try any products from indie lee, must say tho this product really doing well to the skin..the scent isn’t too strong, no tingling effects, leave your skin dewy glowing soft!"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Australia,"Nice, but not sure it makes a difference","I find this to have a pleasant scent, bottle lasts a long time. If it's CoQ10 specifically you're wanting to add to your routine, there's more affordable products you could choose. I liked this, but probably won't repurchase. "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,But it it’s the perfect toner for any skin type,"This stuff it’s great, I love the smell and the bottle 
My skin is acne prone but with this weather I need more hydration and this product make my routine so perfect"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,love!,"This helped reduce the little bumps that I can get on the back of arms! It also feels very nice of the skin, has a subtle yet fresh herbal smell, and comes in eco friendly glass packaging! I would definitely recommend this product. I just finished my first bottle and will likely buy another!"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Holy Grail,One of my holy grail toners. I've been repurchasing this toner for over 5 years. Extremely hydrating leaving the skin feeling dewy. Love it.
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,Subpar ,"There's not much impact on my dry skin. However, doesn't irritate my skin. Spraying on cotton is wasteful to me. Dont think I will repurchase this product in the future "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,CoQ-10 Toner,"tried this because of the review online. I think its really work on my skin, clear out my acne scars and loving my skin now. Bought 2nd bottle already."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Singapore,Impressed!,"Got a small sample bottle. From the 1st use, im totally impresses by it! Does its job for prepping the same for serum and moisturizer! My skin almost immediately absorb the serum and moisturizer! I have sensitive combination skin. It works!"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,Love It!,My favourite toner ever. Have repurchased this a few times. Perfect for sensitive skin as it is not irritating. Very refreshing and doesn't smell bad 
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,Indie Lee CoQ-10 Toner - 125ml,Thought it would be impossible to find a decent replacement for Amore Pacific Toner.....this one is an effective and way more affordable option
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Singapore,Ms,"I liked using this, but is is not ideal. Be aware of the size -- it is quite small and runs out fast with daily use. And the spray is very intense... not a fine mist at all. "
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,nice gentle toner ...,"This is a nice gentle toner ... use it when I want to not use a AHA or BHA toner so I can then use my stronger serums and or retinol. This feels great on the skin - I have combo / sensitive skin and it didn’t irritate me at all. One thing I was not a fan of is mist /spray mechanism. Initially thought it was a great idea, but the mist from the pump is not fine or even enough so I found myself disappointed with that. Much prefer spraying on a Shiseido facial cotton & then using that to swipe along my face! All in all I would recommend this and will repurchase it as well!"
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,USA,A Definite NO for me,"Its always nice to use a toner, It makes your skin feel more “clean” but I used the whole bottle. It did nothing for me. I saw no difference. I will not repurchase."
INDIE LEE-CoQ-10 Toner,Malaysia,nothing special,Nothing special about this toner. Did nothing special to my skin. Just like other drug store toner which way more cheap than this. Luckily i buy the small one. 
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,it’s a ok product ,Bought for a friend. She loves it. But Laneige products are subjective. It doesn’t work for me and caused me outbreak or redness everytime. But friend loves it. 
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,Laneige Cream Skin Refiner,Thought it was going to be a little more refreshing - feels kind of oily in a way. Think applying it on the face with a cotton pad is more practical rather then patting the product directly from your hands. 
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,Very nice ,"First time trying this from Laneige and really like this. Very suitable for normal to dry skin. As a toner, it is very hydrating. I use this sometimes  as a quick hydrating mask by soaking it in thin cotton pads. "
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Malaysia,Nice,"Overall it’s good product and suitable for my dry combination skin. It’s hydrating without feeling sticky. More importantly, it doesn’t cause break out on my sensitive skin."
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,Not a wow product.,Not really sure how it has impacted my skin as I did not noticed any difference after using it for 2 weeks now. Did not breakout from this so I guess it is okay? 
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,Holy grail,use this as a toner before moisturiser - it's thick enough I use just this and a serum and sunscreen for stay home/WFH days. Great for locking moisture in 
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,nice texture,Have yet to try it with my other products but I tried a little in store and really like the feel of it! It’s really popular too so I hope it’s works well! 
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,good product ,i bought this for my friend a week ago she had really dry skin n she told me that after 1 use she felt the difference she would be getting more if u hv dry skin i really recommend this product 
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,Mdm,Made this purchase after a bottle gifted to me on Christmas was empty. Like how light and easily absorptive to my skin this product is. May be too light if you’re looking for proper hydration. Texture is watery so may have a tendency to pour too much.
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,Viral,"Jump onto the bandwagon. Decided to buy because I can't stop seeing beauty influencers raving about this toner. It's not as thick consistency as I expected, just like common toner"
LANEIGE-Cream Skin Refiner,Singapore,very moisturising ,"Very moisturising and skin feels very soft and doesn’t feel tacky. Its great for dry dehydrated skin. Would definitely repurchase again. Worth every penny
"

Will continue use this toner. 
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,Not suitable for sensitive skin,"Every time I used it, my skin appears red for few seconds, it does have that slight stinging feeling. Otherwise I love the Rosewater, I guess Witch Hazel doesn’t suit my skin"

MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,Too strong for my sensitive skin,Not sure why but this formula is abit much for my sensitive skin but it does get all my makeup off quickly. The spout of it keeps on dripping even if its closed so better to keep this at home and not when travelling.
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,Good scent of 🌹,"First time trying this brand after hearing good reviews - I like the pleasant scent of rose and witch hazel is typically a good ingredient for toner. But the product doesn't do much for me, I managed to finish the toner but not likely to repurchase unless I miss the scent of 🌹"

MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,Best for my combo skin,This toner suits my combo skin. Ive used up to 6 bottles now since ive no prob with witch hazel n rosewater. The tiktok n youtube skincare gurus really hate mario badescu but i have no problem at all with this brand lol. 
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,Refresh,This toner is a good to have. refreshing and cleans the skin.  I always use this after my extraction. feels refresh and tone down the redness. Will consider to purchase again.
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,mario toner,This is my first purchase on mario badescu toner .. so far this is good to my skin since my skin is normal skin so I will purchase it again if this is truly the right one for me ❤️
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,love,"i love this toner. it tightens my pores & keeps my skin fresh. i will definetly repurchase 
it suits my sensitive combination skin. the quantity is worth the price as well."
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Philippines,Mild and worth it,This toner smells so refreshingly mild. It does not sting on my face. I'm usually sensitive with scents too and it does not ring up my nasal allergies. I use it twice a day on my face and underarms. It goes a long way for the size too!
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,loving it,Been looking for a rose toner and this is a good bottle of toner that has a reasonable price. It’s friendly to sensitive skin but do not us on your skin if there’s an open wound or it will stings.
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,LOVE IT,This toner smells fabulous and it helps keep my skin feeling fresh and clear. I like that the scent isn't overwhelming and it doesn't burn when I apply it all over.
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,Worth buying,"Product leaves a cooling and soothing sensation on my skin, it smells nice as well, it makes me skins hydrates and easy to apply cream after. I buy it after read so many good reviews on it."
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,Not too bad,Impulse purchase but turns out to be pretty good!There was a slight tingling sensation when I first used it but was gone after a week or so. Does it’s job well and leaves my skin soft and hydrated! 
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,USA,not great for very sensitive skin,"I ordered this product thinking it would be easy on my rosacea-prone skin. I’ve heard positive things about rosewater for redness. The witch hazel was too intense for me and caused immediate skin redness and burning. My husband uses this product, and he has oily skin. It’s worked just fine for him. Therefore, I would not recommend for others with very dry, red, sensitive skin like me. However, for those who have less sensitive skin, this product may be fine."
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,great ,"i love it! only got it after my sister repeatedly mentioned it, but no regrets! it smells great and the price point is really cheaper compared to other brands i have tried! "
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,USA,Not for me,"It’s a good value for whom it works, but this leaves my skin sticky. It’s not at all ideal. It doesn’t dry and become not sticky. It’s just always sticky until you wash it off. I have used other products by this brand, and I like them a loooot. I feel this is just not useful for me."
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,Good ,I kind of prefer this to thayers witch Hazel. this smells much better and is gentle on the skin. I personally prefer the lavender one but its hard to get hold as its usually oos
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,okay only,"it has a strong rose smell but I didn't really like it as it smells fake.
causes my skin to have a slight prickly feel after using, so I don't think it suits my skin"
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,fantastic toner,toner is mild and suitable for daily use. will be purchasing other toners from this brand to try out. toner is lightly scented with rosewater which makes it pleasant to use before bedtime.
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,Worthy toner,"Purchased when there was a 20% sales. The price was cheap compared to other toners available. Was thinking that it might not be as good as my other toners as the price was below average. Surprisingly, it really did a great job. Very gentle and yet hydrating. Recommend to people who might have a tight budget but still looking for a good toner."
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,toner,bought this cuz many people recommends this product and its very popular so i thought i'd give it a try and well no regrets for this product. my skin feels good
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,i love it,Repurchased for many times! Nice for the skin especially in the morning. I always use it for the first step of the skincare routine to refresh my skin. I love it so much!! 
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,USA,great product,"I really like this product.  It very effectively cleans the skin and I did notice a glow to my skin within one week of using it.  Also, the price is amazing! I had used Fresh’s rose toner for years and this one is so much better and much cheaper.   The packaging is def cheap, but I’d rather pay less and have a good product than nice packaging.  I was disappointed to learn more about the company after reading the reviews below so unsure If I’ll re purchase."
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,LOVE THE SMELL,"I love the fragrance of this toner so much, like literally u can still feel the fragrance on your face after applying it, cool :) I’m a acne prone skin type and this toner works quite well on my face, I don’t feel any irritation after all so I would definitely repurchase another one! "
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,USA,Refreshing/Smells Great but Doesn't Do Much Else,Smells Great! A nice refreshing addition to my skincare routine but haven't noticed any improvements.
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,USA,Love the rose scent!,Love the rose scent! I'm so happy to have tried this. It's my new favorite.
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,USA,Great,Really cleans the skin  Will purchase again........
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,10 stars if I could,I love love love this product! I buy 3 or 2 whenever it's in stock! It's done wonders on helping even out my skin tone and in acne control. highly recommend to at least try if you have dry sensitive skin! I love how affordable it is too. I used to use Fresh's rose toner... but this is as good if not better. 
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,Broke me out,Not sure why but this broke me out. I’ve been using witch hazel and rose toners from different brands over a long period of time but this one just didn’t work for me. But great packaging!
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,great ,"Toner that is good even for oily/combi skin! It has a rose scent to it but you’ll get used to it. Leaves my skin in a nice texture and I love that you don’t have to open the bottle up to use it! Thanks to the innovative squirt design on the cap
"
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,USA,Mario Badescu Witch Hazel &amp; Rosewater Toner,I love the product! It was highly recommended and I can understand why. It leaves my face with a different kind of glow. I love refreshing feeling on my face. The price is unbeatable and there isn’t really a scent on it either which I love! I have dry skin and this doesn’t dry my face out at Allen
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,Does not like the smell,"This Rose and Witch Hazel toner boasts feel great. I can feel the hydration effect on my skin. However, I can't tolerate the smell. I just does not like the smell. I thought the smell seem like Pixi Rose Tonic or Mamonde rose water. I won't repurchase and consider to back to Pixi Rose Tonic once my Mario Bedescu finish."
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Philippines,A good toner,"This is also a good product from Mario Badescu. I like the combination scent of witch hazel and rose and when I feel like using a light toner for my face. But price wise, I can find much cheaper toner that does the same job."
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,love the smell! super cleansing,"This is amazing! I use it every night and it’s worth every cent. The smell is gorgeous and perfect on the skin, does not feel harsh and my skin feels super cleansed at the end of the day."
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,USA,soft and clean,"So I have used the Mario Badescu rose water spray and the glycolic acid toner. Firstly, this product is absolutely different from the spray. The toner provides hydration but also dries leaving skin soft and clean. It’s much gentler than their glycolic acid toner."
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,Witch Hazel & Rosewater,Purchased this when glycolic toner out of stock. I like the mild sweet fragrance. Good moisturizer effects. Might consider as alternative purchase when my glycolic toner out of stock
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,Not so bad,"Has a tingling effect once I apply it but it will go away after a few seconds. So happy with it so far. By far the best toner I purchased in my entire life. Worth the money! 
"
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,Good for Sensitive Skin,"Very Gentle, smoothing for my skin. It smells great as well. Most product will give me itch, but this is definitely the exception and a worth to try! No regrets getting one. 👏"
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,Good product,Found this to be refreshing and lightweight. It is suitable for my sensitive and combination skin. I prefer this over the aloe vera version which is more expensive.
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,will repeat purchase ,I've dry skin thus I mixed this with thermal water drench in cotton pad to cleanse my face in the morning. I reckon it may be a little drying if I use it neat. cleans effectively as I've still have an little oily tzone sometimes. bearable smell.
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,Super Love!,"I’ve been trying out a bunch of MB’s products and have been a fan. Not only are their pricing so much affordable compared to other brands for almost the same item (eg. Pixi’s Rose Tonic), the volume of the products are huge too so making it even more worth it. Definitely get this toner instead of the Pixi one due to its price if you’re looking for a rose toner!"
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,USA,"Kind of harsh, broke out my skin.","Honestly, I had high hopes. I've heard good things about witch hazel and rose water and you see this brand all over Instagram. But the one time I put it on my face after cleansing it really broke me out. I had a rough reaction to it. I don't think I'll ever try this brand on my face again. I occasionally use it on my neck and arm pits when I have hormonal funk. But, other than that I don't think I'd purchase it again, it's just kind of harsh. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone sensitive skin. I feel bad giving anything 1 star, but I just wouldn't recommend it."
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,USA,gentle on my sensitive skin!,Love this stuff. Already stocked up on a couple more bottles. My husband and I both use it after washing our faces. It’s gentle on my sensitive skin but it really gets any dirt or makeup left behind. Smells nice.
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,ok,"This product was good on my skin at the start. However I started to break out quite a lot. When I stopped using it my breakout stopped. I wouldn’t suggest this for sensitive skin.
"
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,Best toner I've tried,The key word is witch hazel. The smell is great thanks for the rose water. This toner really cleans your face from any impurities that your double cleansing or whatever wasnt able to remove. I'm obssessed with a clean & healthy skin so starting your face routine with this charm is recommended. 
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,smells great,This toner smells great. It also felt good on the skin and I used it mainly to clear up whenever I used the silver powder so it felt very refreshing. 
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,USA,Drying and irritating to the skin!,"I have combination skin and I am not acne prone, so I thought I would try this brand since everyone brags about it and uses it on TikTok. I done my research on his products and they are harmful to the ocean and destroys the coral reefs and is also bad for the skin. No wonder he has law suites on him! He uses steroids in his products! Please. Avoid the brand and do your research on the ingredients and company."
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,love this toner ,i love this toner! smells amazing when applying and absorbs well into the skin. wish it came in a spray just like the rose water spray.                        
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,Mario Badescu,I was recommended to this product by my close pal and I must said it’s a great toner. My skin feels nice and smooth n there’s no overpowering smell or stinging feel to it. Would highly recommend this product.
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,second bottle!,"onto my second bottle of this. scent is very pleasant and subtle, which is great. it is moisturising and paves the way for clean skin to prepare it for the absorption of your other skincare products. price point is great!"
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,Best affordable toner for all skin types,"I have an oily combination skin and sometimes get dehydrated patches to. This is calming for my skin and I don't have to worry if my skin is oily or dehydrated on certain days, it's an all-rounder toner."
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,Loving this product ,Love the smell of it. And it's really suit my skin. No breakout on my skin. Will purchase it for the second time. and it's also affordable. im loving this brand😍
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,Rosie pleasure ,I love the Rosie fragrance when applying in my face. It does a great job in moisturising my skin. I would definitely repurchase again. So worthy for the price.
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,great,Glad I got it before it went out of stock. I have a habit of applying toner with cotton and leave on my face for about 5 mins then take it off and it will leave my face feeling so fresh and hydrated. I am not sure if I cleanse my face well enough or what but I don’t see this toner wiping away any extra residue 
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,smells nice and works fine,Have been using this toner for the past weeks and it smells really good. Not over powering or artificial at all. Does its job and no breakouts 👍🏼👍🏼 Super valuable for its price too. Good buy!
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,Okayyy,I was searching for a new toner. Im not a big fan of mario badescu but Ive tried most of the products. So far so good but not sure if this is okay. I mean i love the smell and the texture. It’s an okay for me. Worth the price for that amount of toner. Love the packaging though. It doesnt have the cap that a normal toner would have. You have to pull up the tube upwards. VERY convenient!!! 
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,Good toner,I like the scent of this toner it kind of reminds me of my teenage days when I used to put rose water on my face all the time. It’s moisturising and the witch hazel is great for pores. This could be my holy grail.
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,USA,Love this,"I love this product. It’s gentle on the skin. It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated, and the smell is pleasant and not overwhelming. 10/10"
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Malaysia,Mario Badescu Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,This toner was so good on me. I feel different when applying on my face! It really make feel fresh and clean. My skin getting more better. Actually this is my second bottle and will continue using this toner! ❤️❤️❤️
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Singapore,So far so good,My skin used to breakout whenever switching new product. But it didn’t breakout on my face. The only cons will be packing. There is no cap to cover fully. 
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,Philippines,Not everyday?,"Use this depending on your skin condition. If you feel like your skin is already hydrated, stop it at once or you will have oily skin. If the weather also is hot, don’t use it. Otherwise you’ll get oily as well."
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,,pimple breakouts,Had pretty bad breakouts the next day right after using it and I'm not someone who usually breaks out after using a certain product but maybe it's just not suitable for my skin but the price is pricey as well
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,,BEST TONER OVER,i love this toner 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 Awesome toner! First the smell is amazing! It’s super effective. There’s no sting either like a lot of toners have to them. Great packaging! I have and will buy again!
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,,love it,just like the mist it gives you the refreshing feeling and definitely gives you moisture on your face..  plus the lovely smell it has.. its a bit pricey but worth every penny.. 
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,,Obsessed! Addicted! ,This astringent makes my face a natural & healthy glowy skin. It hydrates and calms my acne-prone skin. The smell is divine. This is 10X better than Pixi glow tonic! I keep applying and reapplying this toner all days and nights. A must buy product! LOVE XOXOX
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel & Rosewater Toner,,New fave! ,"Switched to this baby and fell head-over-heels. No stinging at all compared to other toners. It helps clean any make-up residue left after washing my face, and it has a soft, sweet scent that I absolutely adore. It also keeps my face feeling moisturized after application. Will re-order!l for sure! "
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Canada,"Soothing, hydrating, vegan goodness","I have bought this time and time again. I love rosewater, which has been used for thousands of years for beauty, and coconut water is also very hydrating. Because of the coconut water thee smell is not as strong as rose water that you cook with. Whenever my skin is sensitive this helps make it happy again. I have tried to replace with other, slightly cheaper products, but that was a waste of money because in the end, I wasn’t as satisfied as I am with this."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Beautiful and light,Very nice and light enough to use under makeup or right before bed. The scent is a very delicate. I would recommend.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Malaysia,love,My all time favourite face mist. Am a huge rosewater lover so to this product is a total dream. I spray this in the mornings to prep my skin before my usual skincare routine .
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Malaysia,lovely,"Rose hubiscus hydrating face mist: Love the smell & it hydrates my skin well, quite pricy but i got it during sale so it's a worth puchase. Not sure gonna repurchase or not "
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist - 120ml,"Repurchased several times, I can use a hydrating serum alone. I spray this on right after and my skin loves it. I have very very dry sensitive skin."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Canada,best face mist ever!!!!,"I love this rose face mist it’s so cooling, fresh and calming, make my skin so soft and help with puffiness!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Canada,Lovely But Overpriced,"I typically use this as a toner in my routine, and it hydrates nicely, has a light scent, and lasts a reasonably long time. However, it is expensive (in my opinion), and nothing about it is outstanding enough to warrant the price point. It's nice, but it's not that nice."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,My All Time Favorite,"I have been using this for 2 years and I am finally writing my review. I love it so much I’m on my 3rd bottle. I have dry flaky skin and this is like a drink for my face, Its a perfect last step in my skincare routine, and sometimes I wear it in its own because it works so good."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Singapore,rosey,nothing goes wrong with any rose scent for face mist... natural yet smells good.. plus glass packaging making it look fancy.... i always bring everywhere... i can spray few times in a day... to fresh up my look...
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Singapore,Hydrating,Hydrating upon spraying mist on face
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Malaysia,So disappointed ,This product does nothing for my skin. Doesn’t moisturize my face at all and it makes my face feel drier! I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with similar skin type to me. 
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,I love this stuff!,I got this on a whim. I love it. Hydrating. Refreshing. Works for all skin types. I spray it on with I need a pick-me-up. Love it.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Canada,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist - 120ml,"This is a nice spray and very good for the skin, as rose petals make the skin soft no matter what age you are."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Malaysia,To use when your face is damped,"This is my first time purchasing a product from Herbivore Botanicals. It’s packaged in a glass bottle. The spray is really fine, I feel like 2-3 pumps isn’t enough (for me). But that’s okay, meaning you can control how much you want it on your face. I noticed that this can be a bit drying if you use it to refresh your face throughout the day (not after shower/when your face is damped). As it contains HA, I think it’s best if it’s used when your face is damped, not when it’s dry. So far it doesn’t break me out! 👍"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Malaysia,rose mist,"Love it.. But i like to try many other brand, so will buy other face mist when this finished. ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Amazing on irritated sensitive skin.,"I had a really bad allergic reaction 3 months ago, skin broke out in pimple like bumps everywhere on my face and neck. Took that long to get the scarring off my skin. Since then my skin has been so dry and sensitive, very irritable. This mist has been amazing. I spray it when I need some soothing, on damp skin before serums. I will be repurchasing this continually. Amazing!!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist - 120ml,I love how moisturized my face feels after putting this on.  It smells great and works wonders on my face.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,lovely,"I use this after I wash my face/ after toner. It takes the tightness away. Not greasy or oily- just the perfect amount of moisture and hydration to soothe and prep your skin for your serums, moisturizers, and oils. It smells faintly like a rose hibiscus tea. It’s a such a refreshing scent! It does dissipate after a few minutes. 

If you wear a mask all day at work like I do- this is fantastic to refresh your skin when you’re feeling a little stuffy/stale under your mask. 

I do feel that it’s a little pricey for the results and size- I went through the bottle in about 2 months. This strikes me as more of a $23 product- not $32. It’s lovely, but not life changing."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,nice,"It’s a big expensive for what you get, but it is very refreshing snd my skin feels lovely after. I do wish the bottle provided more of a mist though, which is why I knocked off a star"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Canada,Great for a final burst of moisture,"I really like this mist. I use it after moisturizer or on top of makeup to give a bit of glow. The only reason I knocked off a star is because my face can feel a bit stiff or filmy for a few minutes after the spray dries. Super nice though, will likely buy again."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist - 120ml,Love the light mist of this before my moisturizer. Also use it when I get out of the shower. Smells good and makes my skin feel fresh
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Malaysia,Mr,It’s a good toner and in travel size. Very pretty classy packaging but didn’t do much for that price. Pleased with my purchase though. May want to look out for a more affordable alternative
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,worth it!,I have very dry and flakey skin. I was having a really hard time finding a product to keep me hydrated all day. This mist feels amazing on my face and keeps my skin flake-free through the day. One of the only products I’ve found to really help my dryness!
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Singapore,quick and easy,"This mist works wonder for my skin. It is hassle free, just spray on the face, and minutes later I can feel a difference in my skin. It feels smoother. Great for travel, easy, and it works!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist - 120ml,"I did not see a significant difference while using this product. If u simply want a mist with hyaluronic acid in it, get something cheaper."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Love for my hair,I was looking for a rose water and decided to get this. I also like the Fresh mist but this lasts longer for me.  I use this on my hair and face. It’s a great refresher for my hair when i wear it curly or in braids.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist - 120ml,"To me this is a more affordable version of Tata Harper’s hyaluronic spray! I use it daytime before my serum, works great!! Will continue to repurchase."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Malaysia,Hydrating rose scented mist,"The mist pump is not as easy to operate, one press doesn't dispensed a lot of mist, so I have to press a few times to cover the whole face. The smell is rosy. Provide good amount of hydration to the face."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Use after cleansing,"I have dry skin and after I use a cleanser it feels tight and dry. A few sprays of this, before a serum, feels so good! I use it twice a day about three sprays each time and it lasts a good amount of time. Hydrating feel, subtle scent, and its soothes my skin rather than irritate it. A staple in my morning and night skin care routine!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Malaysia,HOLY GRAIL ROSE MIST,"Totally head over heels for this! The scent is natural rose hibiscus scent, very nice no artificial scent whatsoever. Does its job of soothing and giving instant hydration to the skin. The mist OMG SUPER FINE !! So in love with this mist. "
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,My favorite facial mist!,"I love this facial mist!!!! It’s basically a moisturizer. It contains all the goodies: Aloe, rose water, probiotics, sodium hyaluronate, etc. I have combination skin, that is also sensitive and prone to acne. This product does not contain any pore clogging and irritating ingredients!!! I LOVE facial mists! Their quick and easy to use. You don’t have to touch your face when you apply them and you get amazing benefits from using them. They also help your other products penetrate into your skin better. My only complaint and why I removed 1 Star is Herbivores high prices. I was not comfortable spending as much money as I did on their products-including this facial mist but thankfully it has lasted me a very long time. The nozzle mists perfectly and doesn’t spritz large chunks that make you feel like you are getting drenched. It’s also great at setting makeup! I would recommend this mist, their pineapple and blue tansy masks. I would recommend their blue tansy oil but it’s overpriced and I prefer to use argan oil or Shea Moistures shes oil because it’s more affordable! :)"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Love it!,Great facial refresh! And it smells amazing too! My face instantly feels re-hydrated.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Malaysia,The best mist! ,"Been a fan of this brand and their mist is one of a kind. Totally recommended everyone to try on this one, you are going to love and continue to use this!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,looooove,"LOVE this hydrating mist. feels so good on the skin. i think people are unsure as to how to use mists and think it will replace a serum or moisturizer. mists are primarily water and are intended to act as carries for your serums/creams. you still need to moisturize after spraying this on. i appreciate the ingredients and gentle rose scent! only complaint with this product is the sprayer, it kinda shoots directly at your face and not in a halo, if that makes sense."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist - 120ml,"I bought this after several recommendations and feel so conned. It does basically nothing to hydrate my skin if it feels tight during the day. The rose scent is very strong too which isn't really my thing... if you have drier skin and are already doing things like drinking a lot of water and prepping your skin properly, I'd recommend finding a squalane based product instead of this one for those refresh moments."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Singapore,the scent differs ,I bought this one a year ago and the scent is a lot more nicer. The scent from the current purchase just smells different. Not sure if they change the formula or something. But is still a nice product you have if you wanna feel hydrated and refreshed.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Canada,"Good mist, but I think there are better out there","I do like this mist, but the pump is horrible in the sense it needs to be used at close range, and have to do many pumps to mist a larger face.  it's a good mist, but I don't know, it's just not my holy grail of mists. I love that it's in a glass bottle for environmental purposes as I can reuse it once it's done. I've been rotating this with the Caudalie Grape Water mist, and found that to be more of a favorite.  Also, you can't beat their price of $24 for the grape water compared to this 50$ rosewater. 

I like it, but won't be repurchasing, as I don't think it's worth the price."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist - 120ml,"The scent isn’t great, and it didn’t feel moisturizing at all once it dried. Unless you spray it at very close range, it mostly floats away. Made me break out in tiny whiteheads."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,expensive but worth it.,Worth it. For people with dry skin this is a life saver. Totally worth it. I keep going back to it.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Smells like dead roses in water! No moisture.,Smells like dead roses in water. Does nothing to moisturize skin. E.L.F. $8 Hydrating Coconut Mist smells like coconuts and hydrates the skin beautifully. I even spray it on my hands as they have gotten really drying due to over hand washing and hand sanitizer usage during this pandemic.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,So Refreshed,"I got this to cool myself while taking in the sun, and it is amazing. The scent is natural and I’m refreshed every single time."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Canada,Meeehhhhh,"The packaging and scent are really nice, and it does feel great on the skin but it doesn't really do anything other than cool and perfume your skin. I won't be repurchasing because I want something to help with wrinkles, but if you have healthy skin and want a treat I would reccomend this otherwise it's kinda useless."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Canada,Great for everyday!,"Very nice, light mist.  Soft rose scent.  Nice for after washing your face prior to moisturizer, or throughout the day to freshen up!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Non greasy,Love this! My skin is glowing. Non-greasy and has a nice scent.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,works great...but the scent eww,Love this spray. Really makes a difference especially your makeup looks a little caked on  you can spray this and it just does wonders. The only thing is that they changed their scent! It used to smell like fresh roses and now it smells like weird coconut water! Change the scent  back!!
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,So-so,"Doesn’t really do anything, but doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I had to double check the ingredients because it feels slightly drying so I thought there were alcohols in it. Not worth purchasing."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Perfect for Dry Skin MultiStep Skincare,"I ADORE this mist. I use it pre-essence if my skin is dry to help it absorb my water based products easier. I use it when my skin feels irritated from a lot of layers of skincare. I use it as a hydrating toner step. On light makeup days, I use it to set my makeup. And I often use it along with the Phoenix oil before I put on my heavy night moisturizer. My skin does very well with rose, and this is just lovely and light. I will repurchase and probably pick up a mini the next time it shows up in a set to keep in my office."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Love it but don’t inhale ;-),"Sometimes a face cream just isnt enough for me. Enter this spray. The scent was a bit strong for me at first, but just hold your breathe and close your eyes when you spray. I got used to it. It is so moisturizing for my skin (i live in Colorado where its very dry) love it!!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Bad smell,"I got this in the set... and I am so disappointed with this particular product :( IT SMELLS TERRIBLE! It smells spoiled, like bad fruit. I can't bare to use it. What a waste"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Great Booster before Treatment Creams and Oils,I love this product! I feel brand new every time I put it on. It smells great and my face seems brighter and more nourished when I use it. I took off a star because I have to make sure I’m breathing with my nose when I spray it because it catches in the back of my throat and makes me cough. Also just a little pricey for liquid in a bottle.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,New formula is blah!,"I miss the old formula. Ugh this one just isn’t the same. I new smell is awful, smells spoiled. And it no longer contains witch hazel which is one of the reasons why I loved it."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,This is a wonderful mist,I love this face mist! It’s so hydrating and I feel like it actually makes my face brighter and it doesn’t upset my acne prone skin. I like to use it before serum and moisturizer but it feels nice and refreshing over makeup without disturbing my makeup.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,not a fan,I wanted to love this but every single time I use it makes me cough- very odd. I will not be using anymore. What a shame! I like the face mists from FRESH more.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,"No alcohol, perfect for skin care!","A light beautiful hydrating mist. Makes you feel like Cleopatra! What I love the most is there is NO alcohol, therefore, no drying effect. ANyone who knows skin care knows that alcohol is not good for your skin. I use my fan to allow it to dry down. Its takes a little longer to dry than mists that do have alcohol, but who cares, at least your skin stays youthful. The ingredients mostly consists of natural antioxidants that your skin LOVES. I keep it in my skin care fridge to preserve the antioxidants. I am a Fenty fan and wanted the Fenty mist so bad, but unfortunately it had alcohol, so I resorted to this one, and I'm happy! Worth every penny!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,So hydrating yet light on the skin! Love it!!!!,"This & the Emerald hemp oil are my 2 top picks from Herbivore. I have tried the Phoenix, Blue Tansy & Emerald hemp oil. I have tried the Pineapple Glow mask, Prism mask & the Blue Tansy mask & the Pineapple glow mask is my top favorite for light exfoliation. I have also tried the moisturizer & it contains great ingredients, like sodium hyaluronate & feels good on the skin but it does pile easily & so I cannot wear makeup over it & it smells like whiskey to me for some reason LOL! This is my most favorite though!! It contains hyaluronic acid which is 1 of the best moisturizers for skin and that ingredient has been surprisingly hard for me to find in organic skin care that does not contain acne or skin irritating essential oils!!! It also contains aloe which is soooo soothing on my skin and Rosewater which is also very soothing & hydrating!! It smells like fresh roses & water but it’s not too strong and it doesn’t last for more than a second or two which I am grateful for because I am so sensitive to scents that I cannot even wear perfume. It also does not leave a sticky, oily or greasy residue on my face since it is a water texture! There are so many benefits to using facial mist. I use it in between my skin care regimen applications, before makeup, after makeup, before facial masks, during facial masks to help the product sink into my pores. Just to hydrate whenever I need it! This & the Caudalie grape water (not the elixir) are my 2 favorite facial mist a of all time & I would recommend them to anybody!!! Next I am going to try the green tea toner! :)"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Smells bad and overwhelming,It has a very strong old damped roses smell. (I can’t stand it) It’s very overwhelming when I spray it on my face I have to hold my breathe for a bit to let it settle in. It stings my face sometimes. I’m giving this a two star bc it didn’t break me out.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Caused redness and dried out my skin,"I tried a deluxe sample size of this product, and it made my skin burn almost instantly. I had significant redness for two days afterwards and now my skin if flaky as all get out."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Holy grail,"The best toner I’ve ever tried. I’ve had everything from Acwell to Clinique, but they would either irritate my skin or do nothing. This rose water helps my face stay a nice, fresh color - like you just came back from a chilly walk - and hide imperfections. It calms it down a lot and keeps hydrated. The only con is the game rice, but it’s well worth it"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Can't live without this stuff!,Makes my skin super smooth and evens out my skintone! You can use it day or night.It leaves my skin refreshed and soft! Love it!
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist - 120ml,"I’ve tried both versions of this hydrating mist and enjoyed them both. I have sensitive skin and found this to be a soothing hydrating product. I use it to prep my skin for vitamin c serum. The added hydrolonic acid does provide more moisture for my skin than the older version. Although I preferred the scent of the old one this new one smells lovely too. Some might prefer this scent because it is lighter. I highly recommend this product. On a side note I noticed one reviewer said this contains alcohol and it is sold at discount stores, let me assure you it does not contain alcohol and the ones I’ve seen at discount stores are knock offs. I know because my sister bought one thinking it was this and I almost fell for it too. That reviewer was likely mistaken and bought a knock of that has very similar packaging but is NOT made by Herbivore.... buyer beware."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,"High quality, amazing performance","Best hydrating mist I've ever tried. I normally never use the same product twice, but I will never go without this mist again. High quality, amazing performance"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Recommend hydrating mist!,"The rose hibiscus mist is hydrating! I like to use it after I workout and wash my face, so I don’t use it every day. But when I use it every now and then the tone of my face is balanced, I tend to have reddish skin. Recommend!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,A Favorite Go-to Toner,I am a an avid Herbivore lover and this mist is no exclusion. I love the scent and the fine spritz. It is perfect for using after cleansing and prior to applying my Herbivore serums/facial oils. I will certainly purchase this again.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Lovely face mist,"I really enjoy this face mist! It smells great and goes on the skin light and refreshing. I think it makes a great gift, too, as the bottle is glass and beautiful."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Wonderful Toner,"I have sensitive skin and don't like the feel of heavy products... this toner is very light and gentle, does not cause any negative reactions and is not drying."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Great toner mist,I like the old formula better (I think) and I don’t care for the new fine mist top to it. Otherwise still a great product!
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,A great addition,"This is just one of those items I always keep on hand -  I store it in my fridge and use it right after I wash my face as a prep for my serums. I also use it a lot during the summer as my main moisturizer due to the humid climate I live in it's perfect for my combo skin, giving a nice glow without being heavy.

Highly recommended if you need a face mist thats a gentle, consistent addition to your regimen and will be a perfect bridge to your serums and moisturizers."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Toner Toner Toner,I love love love this product. It’s hydrating and smells amazing. Cleanse. Toner. Exfoliate. Toner. Mask. Toner. Serum. Toner. Moisturizer. Toner. Retinol or SPF.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Rose face mist,I love this product. I’ve been misting my face for years. My dermatologist recommended I do this years ago and I love this natural product.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Canada,Changed Formula,"This used to be my favourite Sephora product but the changed formula has ruined it because of the smell!
It used to smell amazing and made my skin feel incredible!!!!
I’m so incredibly broken hearted they changed it!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,super fine spray,"I have used both this and the previous formulation. I thought the original had a much stronger rose smell, whereas the new one has much less scent. I did really like the rose smell but am fine with a less scented product. To me, the mist still feels hydrating. The biggest improvement on the new iteration is that now the spray is super fine, which I love. This is my favorite mist I have tried, but it costs a little more than I prefer to spend on a mist, so I mix it up with others."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist - 120ml,I actually really like this spray despite other reviews. It does smell just like coconut water and I know that’s not a smell pleasing to everyone. I think it makes my makeup look nice as well.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,changed formula,"I loved the original formula. It might have been drying to some people because there was witch hazel in it. I found the witch hazel helped with my minor breakouts and my skin was so clear and hydrated! The new formula does nothing for my skin. They removed witch hazel, and claims that it is more hydrating but I’ve found it irritates my skin. I’m so bummed because this used to be a staple in my routine but now I will look for something else"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Canada,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist - 120ml,It mists really nicely and it left me very soft and moisturized but the smell is a big turn off and I wouldn't repurchase because of it.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,Canada,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist - 120ml,Love this! I use twice daily as part of my skin care routine in conjunction with the Lapis facial oil. My skin has never looked better. Love herbivore!
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Fresh!,I love this! I like to use it to freshen my makeup if I don’t have time to redo. I spritz some on and use my foundation brush to smooth out my morning makeup. I look brighter and more awake!
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Pretty but not great,"Honestly the bottle and aesthetic of this product is the only thing I like about it. It smells very strong of something sharp.. not really rose or
Hibiscus. Doesn’t feel very moisturizing either."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Not a repeat for me,"Smells nice, but if I don't rush to apply my serum or moisturizer, this dries out and tightens up my skin alarmingly.  My skin actually feels better if I skip this step!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist,USA,Smells lovely!,Smells lovely! I love spraying this on my big happy face after I do my makeup just for extra pizazz
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Singapore,A good toner,"I'm not a big expert on toners, but I think this one is not bad. It's a fine toner, absorbs fast, feels good on the skin, leaves it quite soft and moisturized. "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Australia,the bestt,"Favourite toner, it really helps with my dull and dry skin. I would apply it before my moisturiser and sunscreen and it would give me a glossy complexion that last the whole day. The product is fragrance free, so it works well with sensitive skin "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,A must-have in my routine,My new favorite toner! Makes my skin feel clean without over drying and the scent is very minimal. I will never go without this in my skincare routine!
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Singapore,Nothing special,"Nothing special, nothing stands out. Just a basic toner for me to apply after cleansing. Smell bad like saliva as SK-II, but ok I could bear it. I didn’t rely on this toner, I only focus my other brand serum and moisturizer. This is just a toner comes in big size and very cheap price. However, will consider to reorder due to its price. "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Malaysia,good,"It’s good . My bf and I love this product . We are combination type of skin ,after using it our face is quite stable , it helps to soothing my skin too after I  squeeze my pimples "

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Singapore,light toner,"I like this kind of toner. Nose friendly, enough hydration, and super light. The price is so so, though I knew there are similar toner like this out there. Will I buy big size? Maybe! "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Australia,Fresh,Toner is something I’m still trying to figure out and this one makes my skin feel fresh and is pretty good and getting rid of small things left  behind by the cleanser. For me it just don’t have a wow factor 
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Australia,good toner,Pretty good toner. I use this as the extra step to clean my skin after cleansing. However i don’t think it is as “hydrating” as claimed. For my dry skin I have to go on top with an essence. 
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,New Zealand,Very hydrating,I switched from FRESH Rose deep hydration toner to this and at first it didn’t feel hydrating enough. But another week went by and I noticed a difference and it felt that it was just hydrating as the FRESH product. My skin felt soft and hydrated when using this product and for half the price of FRESH I think it’s totally worth it. Highly recommend as a dup for FRESH toner and it’s half the price of that. Would totally purchase again.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Singapore,ok,"Don’t particularly like the fact that it stings on my skin a bit, but if I use it In patches that I can avoid it’s fine as it does not irritate my skin"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Singapore,fresh and clean,"It’s a standard toner feels refreshing and clean, but can be a little bit stingy at times if your face is very  dry. Otherwise it’s a pretty good toner, doesn’t break me out etc "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner - 200ml,"I use this on no-makeup days to refresh my skin during the day (especially during the summer). It has a pleasant scent, helps remove sweat and sunscreen residue without drying out my skin, and does not irritate my hypersensitive skin. I also put a little in a small spray bottle so I can mist it on and pat it in with my hands"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,New Zealand,Moisturizing Toner,really enjoy using this toner leaves my skin feeling hydrated while it removes unseen dirt super easy to apply and is refreshing use this every morning and night

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Singapore,Pricey but good,Although this toner is slightly pricey but it is one of the better toners out there! It doesnt leave a sticky feelimg after. Worth the purchase and would recommend it.

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Australia,to the point ,"A great to the point toner, nice and simple. Had been using the rose toner from Fresh previously and wanted to try something new. It’s very similar in scent and feel and for a much more attractive price. "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,love,"Really nice, softens the skin! Perfect for those crunchy spots!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Singapore,lovely product!,"Loving how light and clean this toner feels. Skin feels clean and fresh yet moisturized after use. Am using it for both day and night. Will 100% recommend!
"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Skip,"I decided to try this after finishing my Belif aquabomb toner, this toner however is very drying, drags on the skin when applying with a cotton pad, it’s weird because the Belif toner has alcohol but this one doesn’t and is way harsher and more drying, skip it!!!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,New Zealand,Love it! ,Love the scent. This product is lightweight and very hydrating. It’s a great product to use under serums and moisturizers.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Australia,Go-to,"One of my go-to toners, love that it's a clean product, and does the job and at a good price point"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Singapore,Best toner,This is hands down the best toner i have ever used. I have dry skin and this toner quench its thirst almost immediately. It absorbs into the skin very quickly as well. I also have sensitive and a bit of eczema on my face but it did not irritate it at all. Will keep repurchasing this. 
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Australia,miss,Very soft and gentle cleanser. Super calming and smells great !
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Australia,Why would you reformulate a already perfect product?,"I used the old toner for several years which brought velvet smooth skin to me. However, when I continue to use this reformulated toner, I start breaking out non-stop and I bought the 400ml version due to how good the old toner used to be.... I am super regretting and frustrating now. What am I gonna do with rest of the bottle..."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,gentle solution for toning and pores,Very gentle can also used on eye lids and under eyes. Love it
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Australia,Good product ,I didn’t really think a toner would be necessary for my skincare routine but this one’s been good. It cleans my skin just that little bit more after cleansing or gets off any makeup i missed cleansing. it smells good too and leaves my skin moisturised 
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Canada,LOVE at first swipe,LOVE this toner. I work in healthcare and wear an N95 for my entire shift and was finding my skin so irritated and dry. I started using the toner on my skin throughout my shift and my skin is soft and moisturized and this toner has really helped with the irritation. Light scent. 10/10 would recommend.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Singapore,Basic,"Nothing special with the toner, it just worka like what other affordable toners do. Considerinf the price, I do not think I will be repurchase in the future. Might stick to k-brand instead."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Weird smell,"I love Caudalie and I’ve been using the Vinopure Purifying Toner, but I wanted to try something more gentle and hydrating. Unfortunately, I could not get past the weird smell! The smell kind of reminds of a fast food place… maybe I had an off batch, but I had to return it."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Malaysia,My Morning Toner,"It's a soft toner. Does not irritate the skin and suitable to be combined with any Vitamin C product afterward. Plus it is so worth the money, one bottle last for more than one month. "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,the best,"My absolute favorite toner! I’ve gone through probably 9 or 10 bottles of it at this point, so gentle for my sensitive skin. It has a very light rose scent which I don’t mind at all."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Philippines,favorite toner,"I’m a big fan of caudalie! I love most of their products and this toner is one of them!
I love this toner! It doesn’t dry my skin nor does it make me break outs! Perfect for my skincare routine 🥰"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Canada,Wanted it to be my holy grail… Didn’t.,"I had perfectly clear skin on my cheek area and wanted something moisturizing. I have sensitive skin and saw the great reviews (albeit was free products), and went ahead and splurged. Broke my clear skin into little bumps within two days. No ingredients should cause a purge (no actives) and so did not repurchase.

If you have sensitive skin be wary!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Will no longer buy,Do not like the changes made to the product and will no longer buy it.  An odor that is not pleasing and the feeling that you are applying something sudsy.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Singapore,Great clean toner!,Great clean product and is an awesome moisturising toner that is handy to have in your skincare routine as it does not clash with any actives or acids. Easy on the pocket as well!
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Singapore,Great clean toner!,Great clean product and is an awesome moisturising toner that is handy to have in your skincare routine as it does not clash with any actives or acids. Easy on the pocket as well!
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner - 200ml,I’m not sold on the usefulness of this product. I tried to add it to my nighttime routine but am not convinced it adds much to the process. The scent is mild and pleasant but I wouldn’t consider it an essential part of my skin care.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,"Why, Caudalie, why?","Caudalie broke the first rule of business--if it ain't broke, don't fix it! This reformulation of the best moisturizing toner on the market (I've used it for well over a decade) is awful. I am not buying another drop of this. The old toner just glided across my face--it was perfect. This reformulation is much less emollient, and drags across my face, wrinkling and balling up the cotton pad. So I am joining many other reviewers here in looking for a new toner. I did manage to score some bottles of the old formula that will last me a year or two, but I am also sampling long-term replacements."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner - 200ml,"feels good, smells good, makes my skin feel good. worth the cost as far as I can tell."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Malaysia,Loving it!,I used their moisturising toning lotion for many years. This is my first try on the new Vinoclean version. Really light the light refreshing smell. The price is affordable too. Loving it.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner - 200ml,Dries out my skin and feels sticky. Switching back to my old rose toner.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Perfect toner,Great toner with rose floral water. Hydrates and removes the last of the impurities left behind by cleansers.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,bring back the old formula,Not a fan of the new formula. The old formula actually helped moisturize but this new formula dries out my skin.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Moisturising,Holy grail! I use this toner morning and night and my skin feels hydrated and plumped!
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Singapore,mediocre ,"I love all Caudalie cleansing products but definitely not this toner. I have oily skin, but this toner was not hydrating enough for me. My skin was rougher. I prefer FRESH rose toner. Double the price of this but effect is definitely better "
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Malaysia,Nice Toner,It is so nice and the smell is okay. It does not dry up my skin. It makes my face feel fresh and glowing. Will buy again in the future. The size is just nice and not too big. Can easily bring when traveling.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Singapore,suited fit oily skin ,I give this a low rating because it didn’t suit my face and was probably not very clear in the instructions or maybe I was blind to see. This toner smells good which is why I bought it but it is really more for oily skin. Mine is combination and this was unsuitable for me. You could feel the dryness after using it. I still like Caudalie. 
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Australia,great,"Really good toner and very good value for the price. Only thing is the smell is a bit funny and musky, I would change it to something more fruity if possible. Very good introduction to caudalie."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Singapore,Great Value Purchase!,"Bought this for my sister as she was looking for a toner. Didn’t expect much from her feedback since the toner is a very basic one that helps remove impurities etc but I was wrong. She said it didn’t dried out her skin and when she was at the office, her skin felt hydrated. She really liked it and she didn’t praise all the other toners I got her before so I guess this toner gets the thumbs up. For its price and quantity, it’s already worth it."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner - 200ml,I don't understand why a perfectly good toner was changed to this. I've used the old one for years and loved it so much. It had that signature Caudalie grape water smell and now it's just a generic rose smell. The pump bottle was also something that set it apart from other brands and now it's just a cap like everyone else. The old formula with hydrogenated castor oil was also more benifical for hydration...new formula just has rose flower water.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Canada,BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA !,"Nope! This is NOTHING like the old formula. I went on a mad hunt to find something that wouldn’t dry my skin and I’m super upset this is missing so many of the moisturizing ingredients the old formula had. I wouldn’t say it is moisturizing in any sense. It tones, but my skin feels tight after and I never experienced that with the old formula. 
Also I miss the pump, it was so easy to use. Now I feel like I waste it because I pour half of it into my hand. 
And the SCENT. Caudalie has been my favourite because of their unique grape scented products. Now this smells like “Thayers” witch hazel alcohol toner. 
Not impressed! If you have dry skin don’t bother!!!!!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Dissapointed,Why would they reformulate something that worked so well before & was loved by many?
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner - 200ml,"Old formula is better, bring it back. I discovered the original moisturizing toner during covid and used 3 bottles. It worked amazing. I don’t know why they decided to reformulate. Now I need to find a different toner I like :/"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Canada,Smell is horrible,I don't know  if this thing is expired or why does smell like boiled eggs. So sad
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,"Nice, Gentle Toner","This is a gentle, hydrating toner. For those with sensitive, dry skin, this would be the perfect toner for you. It's not too harsh or too stripping, but it also doesn't lead to any jaw-dropping results either. Just keeps the face nice and comfortable after cleansing."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Don't fix what ain't broke,"I am so disappointed. I've used the original formula for YEARS and loved it. It was perfect. Why, why why change something so good and well-loved?"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,messed up a perfectly good thing,Why did they add rose??? Why did they change the formula?! It was perfect before. Had a beautiful refreshing scent non alcoholic it was great. Don’t know who made the decision to change a well known and liked toner. Sooooo disappointed.
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Love it!,"The old formula was in my routine for years.  When I saw that they reformulated I got a little worried.  Surprisingly I like the new formulation with the rose water even more.  This toner is so gentle, it even says you can use it around your eyes.  I highly recommend this!  (I have oily skin)."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,"Gentle and effective, good packaging","I’m loving this toner. It’s gentle but leaves my face feeling fresh and ready for my serum. One thing I love about the packaging is that when you tip it over to access the product, it comes out in controlled drops, rather than spilling out quickly. This is great for me because I like to put it directly into my palm and then pat it into my face with my hands instead of using a cotton ball. This packaging keeps me from making a mess or being forced to use a cotton ball. The only reason I dock a star is for the scent. It doesn’t smell bad by any means, but I just don’t enjoy the smell. It smells like a light rose scent to me. It’s ok, definitely not a dealbreaker. Scent is my one issue with most Caudalie products."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Great toner!!,I love the Caudalie Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner with Rose Water!! It really helps my skin feel hydrated especially at night! This is part of my nightly routine #freeproduct #trywithtopbox
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner - 200ml,"I absolutely LOVE this toner. No redness or blotchiness, no stickiness or tightness. Just feels so refreshing and it’s made a tremendous difference in the texture of my skin. I also love that I can apply this over my eyelids too—since I live in a place with hard water, I’m always worried about how harsh it is on my eye area, and this settles those worries without irritating them. If you have sensitive skin, I highly recommend sampling this at a point."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Excellent toner,"#trywithtopbox #freeproduct
I been trying out the Caudalie Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner with Rose Water for about a week and I find it excellent. I have combination skin and the toner had me balanced, not to dry and not too moisturized. I like to use it in the morning and at night!"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Favorite Toner Ever,"I don't frequently write reviews, but I absolutely adore this product.

One thing I LOVE about it is that you do not need to use much, and it smooths so nicely all over your face. Some toners evaporate quickly from the pad and from your face, but with this a little goes a long way. It leaves my face feeling refreshed, clean, and happy. And I LOVE the scent; such a lovely light fragrance of essential oils.

I also believe this has had an impact on my skin: reduced pores, oiliness, and reduction in bumpiness. I have fairly normal skin but it can dry out quickly with the wrong products; this one is perfect. This is my favorite toner ever."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Love it!,"Love this toner! So refreshing and moisturizing, yet can clean all your last dirt out of your face. The price is reasonable as well."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,smell is a no,Unfortunately had to return because I couldn’t get past the smell... made my skin feel clean though
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Canada,WORST reformulation,"I am so frustrated that they reformulated this product. I hate the rose scent and it doesn't feel hydrating at all. The old version was PERFECT. Hydrating, refreshing, gentle.. just perfect. The only thing I've changed in my routine is starting this new formula and I've been breaking out so much- a month before my wedding! So, so disappointed and now I don't know what to use to replace it."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Not Happy with this Change,"I was a big fan of this toner and had been using it for several years. When it was time to but another bottle I discovered it had been reformulated, but I decided to give it a try. It’s been very disappointing. My skin doesn’t have that smooth and refreshed feel that the previous formula gave it, and I’m finding I’m breaking out suddenly—not cool when you’re my age. Time to find a new product."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Canada,Caudalie Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner - 200ml,"Not a fan at all. Loved the prior version - vinopure- this one , has an odd smell…. Feels kind of sticky and my face doesn’t feel refreshed at all after use. 
I’m definitely going to look for another toner, I recommend anyone who reads this to consider the same.
Super disappointed."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Australia,best toner,"I like this toner as it cleans your skin too. Its very refreshing and helps with improving skin texture as well as helps woth pores. Although I'm big fan of skin mists, this product is amazing as a toner."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Australia,gentle,This is gentle and doesn’t sting at all. I really dislike the musky smell and wish that it smelled better. I use dear dahlia cotton pads with this product for a nice self care experience. 
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Singapore,super love!,Been loving this toner since few years back and chance upon it when it was given as a travel size back then. been back and forth with this toner and love that they repackage it as well. the previously packaging came with a pump so could sometimes accidentally pump too much out
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Australia,fab,Love this toner and I generally hate toners. I mean it’s a toner it’s not going to change your skin dramatically but it helps with hydration so much and it helped me manage breakouts occurring because my skin was too dry. Makes skin really soft (if you pair with a good cleanser and moisturiser). A staple in my skincare now 
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,Philippines,Gone glow,"I loved the original formula. This new formula is just okay. It doesn’t give me the same glow as the old formula does. Nonetheless, it is not a bad toner either."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner - 200ml,I used this both at night to remove makeup from the day and during the day to provide a clean skin feel while still having intentions of hydrated skin. This does remove makeup left over  but I would use this as my first step in toning but this doesn’t  completely remove all the makeup the way I need it too. Even after using both products from the moisturizing line I still had makeup on my skin. I got this product sent to me as a  #freeproduct from Top Box Circle! #trywithtopbox
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Soothing and Hydrating,This is s very nice toner. I use it after cleaning my face and it helps ensure my face has no left over makeup or dirt. This toner is refreshing and soothing. My skin feels clean after using it and ready for final step of MOISTURIZER #FREEPRODUCT TRYWITHTOPBOX

I recieved this vinoclean moisturizing toner with rose water and i love it , it smells great and it removes all traces of makeup my cleanser leaves behind and the rose water soothes my skin and leaves it feeling amazing."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Refreshing and soothing,"I have been using this toner morning and night after cleansing, and my sensitive skin loves it! The vegan formula effectively removes any residual dirt, oil and makeup, leaving my skin extra clean and refreshed. It’s also non-drying and alcohol free, so my skins feels soft and hydrated afterward, not tight as with alcohol-based toners. Give this one a try!  #freeproduct"

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,I like the product but it doesn't work for me,"I liked using this product but don't think it was very effective for me. I don't visibly see and enhancements or improvements and my skin isn't appearing hydrated. This toner cleans well. Like removed buildup that I thought I washed away in the shower. I would use it on facial cottons and keep wiping until I got a clean cotton.  When applying, my face felt clean and refreshed. But still dry and not hydrated. I used it in unison with the cleaning milk morning and night. Although I didn't get results from the product, I liked the feel and the way it cleaned. #freeproduct"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Great Toner!!,"I normally do not use a toner,  so I was skeptical about adding one to my routine.  But this toner was gentle and left my skin feeling hydrated.  I only used it in the morning. I used it for several weeks and continue to use it. I love the way this made my skin look and feel.

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,First Time User,"I was able to try this toner with organic rose and its perfect. I'm new to a rose formula and this one is amazing. I really love that this formula isn't sticky or overbearing on my skin. It smells amazing and left my skin soft and hydrated. I'm very happy to see it's alcohol free. I used this product day and night to help rejuvenate my skin and follow up to remove any makeup left behind. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great rose toner.

""MY THOUGHTS""

First off Big thanks to topbox for gifting me this great product & introducing me to this amazing brand. So I use this toner in combination with the Caudalie Vinoclean Almond Milk Cleanser. I put a small amount of the toner on a cotton pad & wipe off the excess residue from the almond milk cleanser that was applied first. I've been using both products together for a lil over 3 wks now & I really like them both. My skin looks & feels more alive & just radiant. I can even say that I've noticed my skin is no where near as oily as useal when I wakeup in the mornings & on going throughout my day. Both of the caudalie products are safe to use in the morning & evening at which I myself have been applying both during my am & pm skincare routine. I love that fresh rose water scent the toner has, & it is very hydrating. I am very pleased with both my cleanser & my moisturizing toner & I will continue to use both. I definitely recommend trying this toner out along with the cleanser as well. 

Gifted by topbox in exchange for my honest feedback, all opinions are my very own.

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,"So I instantly became excited about this product when I saw that it has rose water. I swear it is a life changing ingredient! This toner is a great to use after using the cleansing almond milk,  to remove any makeup I may have missed especially around the hairline and neck. It does a great job at calming any redness that I experience when my skin is extremely dry. I highly recommend it! #trywithtopbox"
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner - 200ml,"I have very dry skin and now with the harsh winter weather my skin has gone extremely dry. This toner really helps to pull in my moisturizer even stronger Bc of the hydration it gives. It doesn’t dry my skin but gives it extra hydration which is love!

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,A pleasant experience,"I never honestly thought I needed a toner in my daily routine but boy was I wrong. Gone are the day of drying harsh toners. I have pretty dry skin and I love this toner. I don’t think I’m ever looking back at my pre-toner days. I used this following my cleanser starting in the morning and then added it into my evening routine after a couple days. No pimples, rashes or purging whatsoever. I would absolutely recommend this product #FreeProduct"

CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Moisturizing Toner,"This moisturizing toner has a very slight Rose scent. I'm not a big fan of Rose scented products, but this one was not too bad. This toner left my skin feeling so gentle and clean. My skin felt healthier and tight but not in a dry kind of way. It's not drying and did not leave my skin feeling parched. It felt well moisturized. I received this product complimentary to try and I would definitely recommend. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox"

I wouldn't have the scent of alcohol on it at all! It has a good rosy scent and is highly hydrating and has a formula that is a little thicker than water. I poured some on a cotton pad and used it to cleanse my face and gently remove my makeup. My skin felt soft, smooth and soft after using it."
CAUDALIE-Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner,USA,Caudalie Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner - 200ml,"Thanks to Topbox, I received Caudalie Vinoclean Moisturizing Toner with Rose Water for free. I used it morning and night on my combination skin, in tandem with Vinoclean Cleansing Almond Milk. It has a subtle scent of roses. I doubted whether this would really moisturize and tone at the same time. During this trial period I opted to skip traditional moisturizer to find out. Lo and behold, while struggling to maintain decent humidity in my New England home during the winter, my skin never dried out or felt ""thirsty."" It effectively pulls out any remaining dirt and makeup, leaving skin extra clean and protected. I've generally dismissed toners in general, but this one seems to get rid of the dirt and give some nourishment back. #freeproduct"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Malaysia,really works on pores,I been using this toner about a month my pores getting invisible day by day.. it’s doesn’t irritate your skin feels fresh and clean after applying it..smells nice..
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Australia,nice but expensive,"I do like this toner though I didn’t see any improvements. Is a bit pricy for quite a simple toner. Love the packaging tho, the glass bottle is really nice. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Canada,Buy this if you want clean pores!,"I've been using this every morning and night for a few months and my pores are completely empty. It says it's pore-minimizing but I haven't noticed if my pores appear smaller, but they are completely clean and empty for the first time in my life. I've struggled with acne and blackheads on my nose, but after using this daily, my skin is the cleanest it's been. After washing I pour a few drops on my fingers and rub on my nose, cheeks, and forehead, and then pat it in. It's very gentle; I haven't experienced any drying. It's a perfect product."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,So so,I just finished a whole bottle and I can't tell if this did anything I have dry skin and large pores and didn't shrink my pores at all i hope it works for u wish it worked for me
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,doesn't dry out the skin,"my sister and I both use it, we have very different skin types and both absolutely love it. it prevents acne and helps with blackheads, but the squalene helps prevent the skin from drying out. lasts forever in the bottle, been almost a year and a quarter of the bottle is still remaining (sister and I use the same bottle) have nothing bad to say about this product"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,"I got this exactly 1 month ago. I went down a tiktok rabbit hole about skin care, wondering if there would ever be a way to minimize the look of my pores/black heads on my nose & chin. Full disclosure: when I started using this 2x daily, I also started a morning routine of Sunday Riley CEO Glow face oil and a night routine alternating Sunday Riley Good Genes & Inkey List Retinol serum. My skin is the best it's ever looked, but of all that, I think the Biossance toner is really contributing the most to making me love how my skin looks. Also not sure if this is disclosed in the product info, but the bottle is glass for anyone who may care."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,My face said no,The pimple population on my face before I used  this was one the pimple population after I used this 10 billion I have communities on my face now a whole village of pimples
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Canada,My favourite toner,"I have tried so many toners and this is the one I always keep coming back to and re-purchasing. A little goes a long way, and it does minimize my pores and cleanses my skin. It’s hydrating and doesn’t dry out my skin whatsoever. My only complaint is that I wish the bottle was bigger - I have to re-purchase it every 3-4 months!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Canada,Glowing skin,I like it! I use this before all my other products. Helps the glow
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Canada,Minimizes pores !,I can’t stop using this. The fragrance and most importantly my pores look much better. This is a staple in my skincare routine. Infact I love all Biossanceproducts.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Australia,A maybe from me,"I have recently changed from Dermalogica to Biossance and the products have been amazing for my skin so I was excited to try the toner.

However, this toner was a little disappointing.  I haven't noticed any difference in pore size and the skin feels a little sticky after using it. 

Unfortunately, the Biossance SQUALANE + HYALURONIC ACID FACIAL MIST isn't available in Australia. 
 "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Staple for monthly breakouts,I love this toner. I love that it doesn’t burn. I use it mainly during my monthly when I breakout. Do not use this everyday…it’s an exfoliant.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Do not recommend,Was not a fan of this toner. I tried it for a month and a half to really get a feel for it. it caused me to break out￼ on my neck and chin which has never happened to me before and definitely got worst time
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Singapore,great toner,Not too harsh to the skin even with all the ingredients like squalane and BHA listed. Does minimise my pores and overall a pretty decent toner. Great for everyday use. 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Canada,Do not buy,This product made me break out really bad and did nothing for pores but make them look larger.  I would not recommend this product at all.  It did not feel nice on my skin at all.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Not what I expected.,"I was looking for to use  this toner religiously in my skincare routine ,  I’ve been using for roughly 1.5 month and  I have noticed a film / peeling off on my nose area and it is very frustrating! ."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Australia,Biossance is changing my skin!!,"Ever since I changed my skincare routine to incorporate some biossance products I have been getting so many compliments about my skin!! Thank you sincerely for helping me find a toner which actually does something other than hydrate my skin. I'm on my fourth bottle of this toner and I'm never changing - redness, pores and uneven skin and oiliness are all definitely better. I AM SO HAPPY!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Canada,Doesn’t work for me,I have a serum by this company and like it so I tried the toner but it feels like a film is left on my skin after use and it may have caused more blemishes rather than reducing them. I don’t feel that it works for me.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Singapore,-,First time trying their product and this seems like quite a popular one so was curious and so far so good! Will continue trying do give it a try too!

BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Philippines,Stopped using this for a while,"I love the scent of this toner. Not so sticky also. But what's weird is it made me break out. I stopped for 2 weeks and restarted using again, and same thing happened. Maybe it's just me. I use this on my neck and arms instead to avoid wasting it. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Singapore,biossance is fast becoming a top fave,"Tried this toner after seeing an influencer’s review on this. I love this as it is gentle but you can actually feel the toner working on the skin,
Hope for further skin improvement with more use. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Canada,"Good, but didn’t like the smell","Not bad, but I personally didn’t like the smell - it’s not super unpleasant, but for personal reasons I am trying to eliminate products with fragrances. I prefer the Farmacy Deep Sweep over this one. Both products got me similar results."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Surprisingly impressed with a toner.,"To be honest - not a huge toner kind of gal. its hard to notice a difference in my opinion (unless its SK-II). My friend highly recommended this to me however, and as I do trust their opinions, I gave this a try. Well, hello, Biossance! Im not a stranger to the line, but to this particular product in the lineup I am. This really turned my head after giving it a test drive. I get oily in certain areas around my nose and forehead, but the rest of my face tends towards dry and sensitive. I used to think I needed a slightly stronger cleanser in the summers, but I think thats not the case; I think using something like this only on my oily areas will be much more overall effective. I cant stand my face feeling taut or squeaky clean, especially with aging concerns. I dont really have a pore problem, but they do tend to be more noticeable in my oily areas; swiping this across those areas definitely left them feeling cleaned and under control. I love the scent, I love the bottle, and the brand! All in all, highly and surprisingly impressed. Glad to add this to my routine - just in time for summer. 5 stars!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,"I adore Biossance. The products were safe and effective through my pregnancy. But this toner does absolutely nothing for me. It smell great, but I felt my pores looked larger after using it and I felt a tad sticky."

BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Singapore,love it ,Love the packaging it makes getting the right amount of product is so easy with the dropper. I do find my pore clearer after use. It’s expensive but you don’t need a lot of it and a good dropper helps you save a lot of product 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Why are you waiting?,Just purchase this. I’m on my 128393rd bottle or whatever now.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Singapore,worth the money.,One bottle last me for 10 months. It’s worth the money and does it’s job well. Would repurchase again in the future. It benefits my skin as it calms my skin down and moisturise it
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Made me skin worse. Don't recommend.,Made me get pimples...didn't actually help get rid of them. Made my skin worse. Don't recommend.

Not sure what happened but I stopped seeing those results. I had not changed any products either. I would totally buy this again, just wouldn't rush to it."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Singapore,so so,A bit disappointed in the hydrating function of this product. I don’t use it that often nowadays due to this reason. Still have a lot of it left in the bottle 
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,The smell is Phenomenal!!!,"The smell of this product, to me, is phenomenal. Just a very clean, aquatic smell that isn’t too heavy, that I enjoy while putting on my face and neck. A few drops of this in the palm of my hand goes a long way."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Australia,Effective at keeping oil at bay ,"I have an oily t-zone and this toner has been great at keeping the oil at bay throughout the day. When I use it in the morning, I find that my t-zone stays shine-free until the evening, whereas without it, it would get shiny by noon. My pores also look clearer and are less noticeable. "
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Australia,love it! ,"This feels slightly tacky on the face but the stickiness will go away after you put on your serum/cream. It’s not irritating at all, very gentle. The pores on my nose do look smaller now :)"

BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,I have not seen any difference while using this. I decided to stick it out and use the whole bottle and it honestly looks like my skin got worse.

BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Singapore,so so product ,"Feeling disappointed at this product, I have sensitive skin and my skin will turn red after application. I love the brand but I guess the ingredients used are too strong for my skin. But the redness will subside after awhile "

BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,My face is in love!,I love this toner! I have tried so many toners bc my mom is always telling me to always use toner first. I was into a lot of Korean ones since my mom is Korean & puts me on a lot of KBeauty products but I wanted to try this one since it’s supposed to minimize pores. This has helped with my pores but it also helps my products after to sink in well in my skin. I love this toner so much that I went ahead and purchased the lactic acid that Biossance has; hoping that will work as well as this toner does!!!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,holy grail,"I’m obsessed with this toner!! I have slightly oily skin and I am prone to blackheads. I’ve found that a lot of exfoliating toners burn a bit, but this doesn’t at all! It’s so gentle yet effective! It’s gentle enough to use every night. It’s also moisturizing because of the squalane. Some nights when I’m lazy i just wash my face then just use this toner, and my skin looks great in the morning."

BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,I really did not see a difference. I tried this one instead of purchasing the Paula Choice toner and this one did not aid in minimizing my pores.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,I ran out of my favorite toner until I seen this brand new in my vanity (I have a lot of brand new makeup that I have not opened yet lol) and its been a week since I been using it and yes its my new favorite product because it removes extra dirt and my pores look smaller

BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Australia,onto my third bottle,I use this at night only after learning it shouldn’t be used with vitamin c products. I love it.

BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,"I love this toner. I use it every day after cleansing and I can definitely see a difference in the size of my pores and it has reduced clogging too. I was really struggling with large, stuffy pores on the sides of my nose and this has helped a ton. It’s gentle on my sensitive, dry skin too."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,New Holy Grail??!,"This product is very hydrating and does a good job at minimizing pores. I use it during the day along with my moisturizer and sunscreen and I love it. I’ve been searching for a light weight toner that I can use every morning and this is it! I also use Paula choice 2% bha exfoliant at night and have not experienced excessive drying from using both(for me it really depended on the moisturizer I used). Overall, I like everything about this product."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Singapore,normal,"The toner is not harsh or sensitive to my skin however I do not know the effect on my pores, didnt really see any difference. But i like this toner as it have a pleasant smell but dont think it is fragrance."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,minimized my poors,First time buying anything from this brand and It does what it says. It minimized the appearance of my pores and it was noticeable especially when i wore makeup. I will say it is a bit tacky after applying. I put moisturizer after to help get rid of that. Overall i will be buying again.  Btw i have oily dehydrated skin. It did not make my oiliness worse.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Canada,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,"Gorgeous glass bottle and gold cap but that’s it. The product is scent free and easy to pour into a cotton pad. I’ve used the entire bottle and my pores are still visible on my face so it doesn’t live up to its claim of minimizing pore size. For that reason, I will not repurchase."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,"It felt nice on my skin, but it had little effect on the appearance of my pores."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,"Definitely don’t over use it, it will leave your skin sticky lol"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,can we have bigger?,Works really well for my over 40 combo sensitive skin. I just wish it came in like a 10-20 Oz pump bottle. ((FYI the bottle is heavy so you won’t realize you’re out until you’re out))
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Pros and Cons,"I’m indifferent with this

Pros: Very Gentle so would be great for sensitive skin. Is not drying but also does not increase oil buildup. I did notice my skin was not as oily, but also didn’t decrease it. 
Cons: I saw no change in my pores after using it faithfully until bottle empty. Didn’t help with breakouts but also didn’t make them worse

Overall I personally would not buy this again but if acne isn’t an issue I would recommend it"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,I bought this after doing the skin care quiz and I can definitely say it helps!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Canada,Good,I like the toner and since i bought the product I do have a reduction in acne but not really something that I expected to fade the dark spots but help to regulate my kind because of the squalene and mild bha ingredients.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,"Perfection in a glass bottle! I love this toner. It makes my skin feel super refreshed. The scent is earthy and clean. A little bit goes a long way. It doesn’t dry my skin out, make my face feel tight and has been great for my combo skin. This is for sure my go-to."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Canada,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,"I don’t like it. It doesn’t work for me. I buy it because I see the comments are good, but It makes me disappointed."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,A good toner that was gentle but also effective. I also like that the bottle was made from glass.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Did very little for my pores,"I was very disappointed by this product. I have used bha toners like Paula's choice before with much success in preventing blackheads and minimizing my pores, but this is not one of them. I like that it has clean ingredients and is non drying but will have to continue searching for an effective replacement."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Canada,Best product for tightening pores but expensive,"I love and dislike this product at the same time. First. I feel this truly works... immediately and visibly. Best product on the market I've personally tried so far.
Why the dislike? I am halfway through the bottle and I'm a month into using this. I had my GLOW Recipe toner for a year and used the same amount each day. For the price it's not worth it to me as I don't care that much about my pores to justify the price of this.
Also it is not as hydrating and refreshing as GLOW Recipe. I think I would repurchase this toner in the summer time as I think the GLOW Recipe one is much more agreeable on the skin during winter."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Great for large pores,I'm about halfway through my first bottle and it appears to be working. Poors on my nose are smaller and I have less blockage.  Will continue using and will purchase a 2nd bottle soon. :)
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Canada,amazing,This is the second bottle I have bought. Absolutely love this. I can barely see my pores now.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Love this! Exactly what I needed. Reduces blackheads on nose and pores all over face. Works best for me when used AM & PM.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Canada,the perfect toner for oily skin,"I will never use another toner ever again. I received this as a sample and saw results instantly. Then I bought the full size and use it every morning and night after washing my face. I felt my pores were smaller and the texture of my skin was smoother! Not only that but my oils felt more controlled for the first couple hours of the day. This didn’t irritate my skin at all, and it didn’t leave any residue on my skin. Sunk into the skin so nice and my skin just feels amazing after. No stinging !"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Been using this for over a month. I have sensitive/dry skin this has been great on my skin and I will continue to purchase
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Canada,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,I received this in a sample box. Not a super big fan of the smell and I prefer not to use BHA toners so will not be repurchasing.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,"Sure, why not?","Helps with acne prone / blemish skin; when used in conjunction with gentle cleanser and probiotic moisturizer. Not sure if I will use in my everyday routine, but helps clear breakouts overnight!"
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,Canada,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Got a sample and fell in love! My skin looked smoother.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,NEW HOLY GRAIL,"This is THE BEST toner for sensitive or dry skin. I used to use the famous Paula's Choice one, and I like this one even more. Safe enough to use morning and night, and it doesn't strip my skin, and its gentle enough for my eczema prone skin."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Great for sensitive skin,I have sensitive aging skin and this product does everything it claims without any irritation. Many aha/BHA products give me a rosacea type reaction. Not this one. This whole product line has been amazing for my sensitive skin. My skin looks clearer more even and luminous. Love it!
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Great for pores,I find this toner very good for my very oily skin. I have huge pores that are very hard to keep clean since my skin is so oily.  I use it morning and night and in between when I can.
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Meh,"I don't hate this product, but I don't love it either. I love Biossance as a brand but this toner just wasn't anything amazing for me. It feels nice on the skin and is pretty hydrating, but I don't feel that it had done anything to either clear my skin or affect the appearance of my pores in the two months that I was using it. While Biossance is one of my favorite brands, I don't feel that their acne-targeting products are as good as other brands. If you're looking for BHA with better results, I really recommend Paula's Choice 2% liquid exfoliant or The Ordinary's salicylic acid mask."
BIOSSANCE-Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,USA,Biossance Squalane + BHA Pore Minimizing Toner,"No change in pore size appearance, not worth the $$."

FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Essentials (Christmas Limited Edition),Australia,the items in this set are amazing,"I love the overall smell and way this set makes my face feel, it's been nice to try seeing as I've never used products like this before, definitely worth the purchase!"
FRESH-Rose Deep Hydration Essentials (Christmas Limited Edition),Singapore,Nice!!!,"have not tried all the products, only tried the rose mask, oil serum and the toner. so far am loving it the mask really softens the face and the smell makes me feel like it's a pamering session each time I use it. Will definitely repurchase!!!!!! the oil serum does it's job by really hydrating the skin. 4 stars because the petals in the toner sort of hinders the exit"
GLOW RECIPE-Pride Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,So hydrating!,"This could just be my favourite toner ever! Every time I apply it, I can feel my skin tighten and it simply makes me feel so refreshed. Plus, I absolutely love the limited edition version! 🏳️‍🌈 "
GLOW RECIPE-Pride Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner (Limited Edition),Malaysia,ms,Absolute favourite pore tightening toner. My skin and pores feels tight after application .

GLOW RECIPE-Pride Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,Smells good,"The toner smells really good. However the consistency is a little thicker than I’m used to, and it does make my skin feel sticky after using. Although it hasn’t cause any outbreaks… so far. "
GLOW RECIPE-Pride Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,Toner,First tried this and it broke my skin. Then I tried it again after 2 weeks and have been loving it since. Find that it helped to refine my skin before skincare routine. Now i'm loving it.

GLOW RECIPE-Pride Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner (Limited Edition),Malaysia,good toner,"Bought this because of the limited edition bottle. The texture is lightweight and it gives a hydrating finish. I didn’t experience any irritation, hoping with longer usage it can control sebum production and also help to exfoliate dead skin cells"
GLOW RECIPE-Pride Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,I CAN’T LIVE W/O THIS,This is by far the best toner I have ever used. Nice light fragrace. I layer it to a maximum of three times. I’ll also add my Vitamin C drops as I pay this toner on my face. Try not to use cotton wool as it’s slightly thicker than normal toner. It does helps a lot with the pores. A DEFINITE one to purchase again after I finish my bottle. Really worth it as it can last really long. 
GLOW RECIPE-Pride Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,great!,"Repeated purchase. Finished my first bottle. Loved that it smells great, absorbs well and feels good on my skin. Will definitely repurchase again when I’m done with this. "

GLOW RECIPE-Pride Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner (Limited Edition),Malaysia,Wow,"Easily absorbed, makes skin less oily, controls breakout except the monthly ones (can’t do anything much but I get one or two) see some improvement on the fine lines. Overall I’m happy with the toner and with diligent use I can see some difference. One thing though, I’m not too fond of the scent. The watermelon scent is rather unsettling but got used to it now. It last pretty long too and I still haven’t reached half bottle yet. Worth the price "
GLOW RECIPE-Pride Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,Really hydrating!!,"Love this product! Amazing texture, makes my skin feel bouncy. I find it to be quite hydrating too! The bottle is really pretty as well (it’s glass!)."
GLOW RECIPE-Pride Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner (Limited Edition),Malaysia,preferably at night ,It is my second bottle and i like it. For am routine i just dab it with my fingers after each prayer( u know we pray 5 times a day and we wash our face that much too) the consistency is too thick so I won't need anything else apart from this toner.( Malaysia is everyday summer) but i id like to splurge all kinds of toner and buffer it with anti-aging products and finish it up with rich moisturiser. 
GLOW RECIPE-Pride Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,nice!,"bought this in support of the lgbtq+ community! the pha and bha in it are very gentle that it did not irritate my sensitive skin, my skin feels hydrated too."

GLOW RECIPE-Pride Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore-Tight Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,Good PHA+BHA Toner,"This toner is slightly thicker in texture compare to other toners I hv user before. It’s more like a serum but a little thinner. The limited edition bottle is nice. It’s hydrating n yet not too rich for my oily skin. Skin does appear tighter, clearer n matt after using it. The smell of d watermelon smells a little artificial but it doesn’t bother me much. Might repurchase after I’m done w this one. "

LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Singapore,Tonique Douceur,"Tonique Douceur

I expected a lot more since it is from Lancôme.
It was a below average toner, no impact. Instead I have a mini breakout after using it."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Singapore,Toner for sensitive skin ,This is very gentle for my sensitive skin. I have been using this toner for many years. As I apply Retin A I am not able to use very harsh products. A good product for this price. 
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Malaysia,Good Product,"My first time purchasing. Yes it is good product, does not sting on my face. Scent is delicate and does not smell like alcohol. Personally I think it is not SO MUCH BETTER than other toner I usually use. Idk, maybe bcs toner works the same. Would I recommend to a friend? Yes! Would I repurchase? 50-50. Quite expensive but big size. But still, if you tend to use toner on big amount like I do, better opt for cheaper toner😹"

LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Singapore,toner ,Can’t tell if this product is good or not as toners seem to work the same. But there’s colouring in this so I won’t recommend it to sensitive skin. But it’s quite affordable for the size of 400ml. It also has a scent so I assume there was fragrance added. 
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Canada,Lancôme Tonique Douceur - 400ml,My favourite toner! My mom introduced me to Lancôme. She’s 65 and she’s been using Lancôme products for atleast 20 years. This toner does an incredible job with balancing my skin and is a great product to use underneath serum / moisturizer.
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Malaysia,Normal toner good for oily skin,The scent of this is quite strong. I would use this as a mist or just general toner. It is quite a big bottle so it took me many months to finish it. Toner is very refreshing and does not break me out.
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Malaysia,okay. ,"not gonna say it’s the best,but to be fair no toner has been that great before anyway.

giving this one 3 plus stars because it doesn’t break me out and the smell is not too overwhelming. "

LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Malaysia,Love it,"Before this my skin is dull and my skin texture is bumpy. After i use this toner, it makes my skin smoother & glowing. This toner is suitable for my oily skin. I really love it."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Australia,All-time favorite toner!,"I was gifted this toner a few years ago and since then I have kept coming back to it after trying new toners.
First off I'm a huge fan of the smell of this toner. It's alcohol-free and therefore doesn't give off the alcoholic smell that most toners do. It sits on the face super lightly and feels very refreshing compared to other alcohol-free toners that I've tried.
I use this product day and night and the 200ml bottle usually lasts me over 6 months.
I've repurchased this product 3 times already and no doubt will be back for more again."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Malaysia,It’s quite hydrating but the scent is...,"I bought it after I tried the sample that was given by Lancôme from the previous purchase. Overall I like the texture and it’s hydrating. However as a guy myself, the scent is a bit too flowery for me >.<"
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Malaysia,Moderate,"Overall, the toner is good, non sticky, fast absorb. The price consider reasonable for this quality. Anyway, I feel it is not moisture enough for my skin."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Lancôme Tonique Douceur - 400ml,Smells good but felt like it left a sticky coating over my skin.

"
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Australia,Good product always have used it,Good product have always used it. Would recommend to a friend
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Philippines,Lancome Tonique Douceur,"The lancome tonique douceur helped my skin a lot. I have sensitive skin but this toner feels completely comfortable during and after application, it has a soothing and cooling effect on my skin while it gently tones it up. It doesn’t have a skin drying effect which other toners do in fact your skin will really feel hydrated after using this product - not to mention it smells really good!"
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Philippines,Overpowering Fragrance But Worth a Try,"I typically ignore Lancôme products because I feel like I’m not part of their target market. And also because if their notorious use of fragrance as part of their ingredients. But I have always seen this toner as one of its best- selling products. My initial thought upon seeing it was this thing is huge! You really get what you pay for! Certainly won’t have any problem running out of toner for a year with this one. As for the product itself, I was initially hesitant to try it because of its overpowering fragrance! It literally smells like perfume. I have sensitive skin so I just used this gradually until my skin got used to it. Now, I’m using it daily and I love this! It moisturizes my skin without making it oily. Removes dirt, preps my skin for the next step in my routine. Another good thing: it doesn’t break me out. Will I repurchase? No. But it’s worth the try, and worth the money. "
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Singapore,a wrong order,"I use this toner to double cleanse my skin to remove remaining makeup residuel or skin sebum. Make me feel my skin clear. It dun really dry out ur skin, but somehow provide a mild moisture to skin. "
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Malaysia,Good,"For the price I paid and the volume I received, it is definitely a good deal! It is a decent product, works well on my combination-dry skin. The only thing that bother me is the blue coloured water. Other than that it is perfect!"
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Singapore,Moisturise,"Volume is big and the rose smell is acceptable, not those kind of artificial smell. Pros are this toner are quite moisturise and absorbs quick with non-sticky feels. Cons are the hole of the toner are very big, the toner would pour out many easily if the cotton are not stick to the hole. Those who use toner patting by hands should handle it carefully."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Singapore,2nd Purchase ,I have a combination skin and this no alcohol toner helps me a lot with my oily combination maintaining moisture for a longer hour. No breakouts and this is my second bottle. Looking forward to third bottle. Worth for every cents.
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Just buy it! Seriously u won’t regret it!,I don’t usually come back and write reviews but this toner is amazing and it lasts forever!! My skin always feels so nourished when I use this before my normal skin routine. I’ll never go back to anything else. It’s phenomenal!
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Disappointment,"I've never used a toner and wanted to try one so I picked this one up at a Lancôme counter at Macy's. I've been a loyal Lancôme customer for many years and have always been very pleased with their products, however this one disappointed me. I really tried to love it, but it just doesn't work for me. It made me breakout within a week. I used it twice daily after my usual skin cleansing routine and put my moisturizer on after it. It smells really good and it did feel refreshing, but I noticed that my skin became extremely oily within 30 minutes after applying it. My skin is naturally very oily, so I think the oil from this product may have contributed to my breakouts. I would recommend staying away from this product if you have very oily skin."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Singapore,Nice Toner,It’s really hydrated and make the skin refreshed. I prefer this toner than Fresh toner. I gave four stars because of the price. I think a bit pricey for toner. 
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,,good for oily t zone,"Have been using this few years ago. Changed to other toner but still go back to this. I think it’s suitable for oily t zone skin. This is my third bottle purchase and I will continue to buy this!!
"
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Lancôme Tonique Douceur - 400ml,It is pretty good hydrating toner. Love the smell . I use it in the morning. Will repurchase
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,,Water in heaven ,First of all I love the smell of this product. The rose scent so refreshing. I lather this in the AM as I use other toner for PM. I just wish the bottle top where the product comes out should be smaller you tend to spill if you’re not aware. Other than that one minor point this toner is amazing 😉 
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Lancôme Tonique Douceur - 400ml,"This has been a staple in my skincare routine since my teen years.  My mom introduced me to it, and I've continued to use it as an adult. Great way to prep the skin."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,,tonic?,generally I love this product esp when kept cold as it's really refreshing to us. however the scent might not appeal to all. the results were not outstanding
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Australia,Good product,"I have been using this Tonique Douceur for many years, and always love it. By applying it straight after washing my face,  the skin feels hydrated and smooth."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,Canada,Great product,"love this Lancôme product, nothing compares, the smell is awesome!"
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,read the ingredients,"While I have used this for years because it claimed to be alcohol-free, after being more ingredient conscious, I saw that benzyl alcohol is listed as an ingredient, so it is not alcohol free. Also this contains a paraben, namely methylparaben, so I switched to one of Sephora's clean alcohol free toners intstead."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,,Great alcohol-free toner,"Tonique Douceur is part of my nightly routine after cleaning my face and before applying night cream or moisturizer. Leaves my skin cleansed, refreshed and balanced. No feeling of dryness or tightness. This alcohol-free toner works great for my combination skin. Been using it since my 30's. Now I'm 48 and still using it."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Lancôme Tonique Douceur - 400ml,"This is one of the worst toners I have used, irritated my skin and it has alcohol big no no."

LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Not a clean product,"I really love this toner. This was 1st true love toner. However now that I am learning so much about skin care, I would feel more comfort using something that is at least going in the direction of becoming clean, or vegan. Because of this choice this will be my last Lancôme toner purchase. Despite of that, this is a great toner that does not dry out my skin and actually feels like it gives it that extra clean."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,,lancome,"Lancome tonique douceur, its free alcohol. Thats why i love this toner so much. I just used this for 2weeks. So far its okay for my skin. It smell so good. This was my first botle so maybe i will repeat this or try to another brand. "
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Lancôme toner,Feels fresh and clean and ready to use the moisturizer
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,"Ugh, not clean.","For a while, this worked so well on me. However, I ended up switching because for the price, it's not clean at all (parabens, dyes, and fragrance). If those things don't bother you, this is great, but I switched because of that."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,,very hydrating!!,this is not my first time buying this toner. this toner never disappoints. smells great and works very well. I can see the difference in my skin texture after using this.
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Gentle and soft.,"This is a really lovely smelling, gentle toner. I loved using it before bed. It leaves skin soft and smooth in winter. I do not feel that I noticed a difference in the tone of my skin. In the summer I went back to natural witch hazel for my oily skin."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Hydrating,I    really like this toner. It smells so good and is very hydrating for my dry/combo skin. Will be repurchasing when I   run out (:

LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Lancôme Tonique Douceur - 400ml,I love this toner. It’s really nice to my skin and has a nice smell.
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Broke Me Out,"While I loved how gentle this toner was, I used it for about 2 weeks and noticed that it was breaking me out. It was the only new thing that I had introduced into my routine so I know it was the culprit, and I’m not usually very sensitive to having scented skincare products but my skin didn’t agree with something in this toner. If you have sensitive skin, I would try a smaller sample first before committing to the full size."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Smells Amazing,It's absurd to spend this much on toner but I keep buying it because it smells so good.
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Give it a try!,"Really and truly a toner that isn’t harsh!

LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Lancôme Tonique Douceur - 400ml,"It helps me a lot! I truly recommend this product, i used it at the end of my day as as refreshing tonique."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,,Amazing Products Worth Expensive,I am having acne on my face. It helps to minimize my acne. Put any skin products in your refrigerator to keep it more long lasting and give you a chill when you are using it. I'm satisfied with this toner temporarily.
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Must for dry sensitive skin nightly routine,"I've been using this for a few weeks and ready to review it. I was using the Elizabeth Arden Age Revitalizing tonic which was very gentle and soft on my dry, sensitive skin so I was nervous to replace it with something else. But this has been a God-send. It is gentle, doesn't have an overpowering smell and always removes more makeup even after I double cleanse. I always moisturize after using this and it helps the moisturizer or facial oil absorb better. If you have skin like me, I definitely recommend this."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Lancôme Tonique Douceur - 400ml,Love love this toner. It makes my pimples smaller the next day!!
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Lancôme Tonique Douceur - 400ml,I like the smell and the appearance of the bottle. It feels nice on my skin and it makes me feel fresh in the morning. The big down side to this is that it hasn't really done anything for my skin - good or bad.
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,The Perfect Toner!,I bought this toner because it is alcohol free. It smells floral and really removes any excess foundation. The next morning my skin definitely looks more glowing and hydrated and it even seems to help reduce acne slightly!  I will keep using this toner!
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Great for oily skin,"I have oily skin. I got a sample size from Lamcôme in a free gift bag. I love this toner. I was so excited to see Sephora had it. It’s not harsh on my skin and it doesn’t leave my face feeling dry afterwards like
most toners. It leaves it  feeling so smooth and soft."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,,Classic Toner,This is an all time favo classic toner of mine. I have a super sensitive skin but I do not have any problem when using this toner. It'll be much better to keep this in fridge before using as it give you a chill/ cooling effect for your skin.
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Lancôme Tonique Douceur - 400ml,"I bought this after spending a long time at the store trying to find the perfect toner for my skin. For the first few times I used it, it made my skin feel soft and supple. But the smell was so pungent! And after a few days of use, my skin looked so red and angry, I returned it right away. I do not recommend this if you have sensitive skin or are sensitive to strong smells"
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Lancôme Tonique Douceur - 400ml,"Has a very light fragrance to it, making me feel refreshed without the alcohol."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Really Good Toner,"This toner is soft and gentle on your skin. My dry skin is very sensitive, however this toner does an amazing job and hydrates it as well as balance it. I would recommend."

LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Lancôme Tonique Douceur - 400ml,"Toner is known to give me a dry, tight feeling around my face, but this toner does neither of these things. It refreshes and cleanses my skin without drying it out. I love using it on a daily basis and don't feel the need to go back to cheap store brands."

LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Refreshing and great for combination skin,I love this toner because it refreshes my skin like no other and I like how this is alcohol free and it refines my combination skin. I have an oily t zone and dry cheeks and this works wonders. I made a video review on this and my skin care routine if anyone is interested.
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,my HG toner,Been using this product for years! It's so refreshing! Can't live w/o it!
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,I love it,Really I love the smell. It is refreshing. Not sure if it made a lot of difference but I miss it. I bought the one for dry skin but I do not like it as much as this one.
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Perfect,"This tonic is perfect to use at night right after I wash my face after having makeup on all day. I can be sure that once I use this I know there is not any more makeup residue left on my skin. Perfect way to prepare for moisturizer! Although it is a liquid, it does not dry my skin. AMAZING!! The price is not bad either. I have been using mine for almost 5 months every night and I still have a little bit less than half of the bottle. Will purchase again."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Lancôme Tonique Douceur - 400ml,"very bad smell when u put a lot on face, and burns my skin, never purchase again, not recommend"
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,not good for oily skin... not good in general,"I have oily skin, but also sensitive skin - so there's no way I could use Lancome's original toner. But this really doesn't even feel like it tones! It leaves my skin very sticky, and I don't feel like my creams and serums get absorbed into my skin after I use this. Really disappointed, since I heard many rave reviews.

Won't return it, but won't repurchase it either. Maybe I'll hand this off to a friend with dry skin..."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,I like it,"The smell is great and it is refreshing, but I haven't seen much difference in my skin."

LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Refreshing and Clean,"I love using this product night and day. It feels so good on my skin. I use this during the winter instead of my Clinique 3 toner. It gets the job done without alcohol, which is good during winter. I really like the light sent that it has too. My skin feels smooth and ready for my other skincare products after I use this. I recommend this for all skin types, even oily! (during the winter)"

LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Impressed,"I never buy Lancome usually bkuz I think they are perfumed pricey products. HOWEVER, i am thoroughly impressed with this toner, it's a huge plus in the cold weather to have an colhol free toner. This leaves the skin soft and supple.

LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Wonderful toner,"I have never used a toner due to the fact that nearly every toner in the past had alcohol. I have normal to dry skin and I don't need a product that would dry my skin out even further. However, alcohol free versions came out and so I decided to try lancomes toner. It is definitely refreshing and takes off more stuff off my face left behind by the cleanser. I love using it before my serums and creams because it absorbs the product more better. Would definitely buy again."
LANCÔME-Tonique Douceur,USA,Great job,I use it before applying my moisturizer. Nice work. It also calms down my nose a little from being oily so quickly.

-soothing and moisturizing 
- it feels like other products wok better 

Cons:
- strong perfume scent (for all those of you sensitive to this) 
- stays a bit tacky for a while, even with other products layered on top."
DIOR-Capture Totale Intensive Essence Lotion Face Lotion,USA,Honest Review - Over 50 & just started using this.,"I am 54ish years old & purchased this product 

I have only been using this for a few days but I already notice that my skin appears brighter, feels softer, and the redness is fading away!  

I love this lotion!!!  I suspect this will become a game changer for some!  Now, at first I thought it might be watery but it is a clear lotion. Very soothing & moisturing!  It takes one penny size drop for my entire face & neck and I use it after washing. 

My system:  Dreamskin face wash, Dior 1-minute mask once a week, then the Capture Totale Essence Lotion, Tatcha the Dewy Serum (new addition), Dior Hydra Life Eyecream, Capture Totale Dreamskin Care & Perfect skin perfection- I also use the Backstage skin perfector as a base when traveling as it’s easier to pack. I use the Dreamskin foundation for the days I need a more finished look. I did replace the Dior serum with the new Tatcha serum just to try it out but I will be switching back. 

In this photo I have used my Dior line but did not put in any foundation or face powder. I am wearing the new Refy brow in Dark, Dior backstage eye shadow, Dior backstage contour, Lancôme mascara, Dior lip addict, and Maracuja juicy lip plump."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Singapore,good toner👍🏻,This toner is just an easy part of my skincare routine.I use morning and evening. The tonic makes the skin clearer and smoother. I have combination skin and this toner helps.
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,So gentle,I absolutely love this it’s so gentle and makes my skin so soft I love it. Just don’t use vitamin c with this since PHA doesn’t go well with it and I learn it the hard way
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Good for its Price,"I like the size of this bottle, as it is perfect for travel, but the bottle leaks. I also only had 2/3 of the product left in the bottle when I received it, likely from it leaking during delivery. When I take it in my travel pouch, it leaks, too. Just a very leaky bottle that can be improved. 

Regarding the product, I like another toner I've used before more than this toner, but Dr. Dray on Youtube has given her approval for this toner. I get acne here and there with some bumps around my temples, and I think Dr. Wu's Pore Refining Toner works better for me, but this is budget friendly, and PHA is supposed to be quite beneficial for the skin."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Great for sensitive skin,"This is a great Toner. I have sensitive skin and was apprehensive to try this as usually using any sort exfoliator or toner makes my skin red and hurts to use. This is very GENTLE and is wonderful for sensitive skin. It has helped resurface my skin leaving it feeling soft and helping with my acne scaring. my whole skincare routine (except for eye cream) is Inkey list, they have great products including this one."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,meh,"I guess I haven’t been super consistent with it, but when I was for a bit I still didn’t notice much happening"
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,The Inkey List PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner - 100ml,"I bought this based on skincare blog recommendations, but I have no idea if it did anything."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,amazing toner ever so safe,this PHA is amazing i love it wish they have in big size so i don't have to go back and forth . honestly it is good for people like my skin sensitive .
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,AMAZING FOR SENSITIVE SKIN,I have extremely sensitive and reactive skin that most exfoliators make my skin burn and turn red. BUT NOT THIS ONE. It doesn't burn at all and it doesn't make my face red one bit. I have also very dry skin on my forehead and it got rid of my dry skin flakes in only a few days!!! I started by using it only once a day to get my skin used to the product since it's so sensitive and my skin looks amazing so far. It's also already starting to get rid of my acne! I really recommend it for people with very dry and sensitive skin! It's the only exfoliator that's been working for me yet.
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,okay.,I have very sensitive skin with Rosacea the ingredients seams good and if I waited for the product to dry before applying anything else it really didn’t burn or anything. 3 stars because I am not sure it exfoliate that much. Might repurchase if I really cant find another PHA
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,The Inkey List PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner - 100ml,The bottle leaks..horrible packaging..I made the mistake of taking it travelling and lost half the bottle as it leaked everywhere
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,INCREDIBLE,"I rarely put reviews but this was seriously a game changer. When I suddenly got skin bumps that were not quite hormonal acne, but more like clogged whiteheads or fungal acne it was very hard to get rid of the stubborn spots, however, when I started using this the blemishes started going away. It is gentle enough for beginners to acid toners (like me) and was fine to use often throughout a week (and my skin is acne prone, dry, AND sensitive). I finished the whole bottle and it has been a while since my last use of it but my skin has been smooth and without the small fungal acne since. If you’re thinking about trying it, I would definitely recommend!!"
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,The Inkey List PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner - 100ml,"When I first received this it was leaking through the box it came in, it wasn't significant so I kept onto it. I've been using it for over a month now and haven't been able to identify any extra benefits of using this vs other products I've used. I have a similar opinion on this as I do with the moisturizer,  the price does not match the amount that is given. I bought a bunch of INKEY list products because of the gift cards I had.... I read reviews as well.... I feel like I've been lead astray, from the reviews!!! lol geez. Anyway. I hope this review helps yall!"
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Good choice for introduction into acids...,"I bought this as one of my first steps into the world of acids.... Though after finishing the bottle, I've not much positive to say about it. 

I started with every other PM use, then eventually worked up to AM/PM use, and then to even layering with The Ordinary's Mandelic Acid in the PM -- fearing that my skin wasn't prepared for any stronger BHAs/AHAs, but in hopes that I could achieve similar results. 

What resulted was minimally exfoliated skin -- leaving my skin slightly smoother than before I started, but nothing more.... With expectations that it would help with blemishes, blackheads, and texture. 

I don't regret purchasing as I believe it was a cautious first step into the big scary world of acids, and summise it would be perfectly suitable for those with sensitive skin who can't use other AHAs, and those completely new to acids.  

I DO recommend... I just don't be repurchasing. 
Which is a shame as I enjoyed the price point."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,The Inkey List PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner - 100ml,"After using this product once a day during the first week, I’ve seen drastic changes to the texture of my skin and my hyperpigmentation is fading rapidly… I love it, I just wish they made a bigger size!"
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,The Inkey List PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner - 100ml,"Hopefully I don’t jinx my luck by saying this lol, but I love it! I have very sensitive skin and this is soo gentle, after I use this my skin feels so smooth and refreshed and my cream applies nicely after."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,The Inkey List PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner - 100ml,"Pros: Scent free, long lasting, gentle
Cons: None!

As most people who have used toners know, they can be extremely drying or can make your skin burn. I've tried several different kinds, and all of them absolutely wrecked my skin barrier despite using them three times a week max. This toner though? Didn't. No burning sensation, and can be used daily. It also gives your skin a really beautiful glow. So if you're looking for a toner that won't burn your sensitive skin, try it out :)"
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,"good product, bad packaging","I loved this product, only reason I’m not giving it 5 stars is because the bottle definitely had a manufacture issue and the lid wouldn’t close right. I made the wrong decision of packing it in my suitcase with clothes and spilled over everything, had to leave it there! Will buy again but definitely check and make sure you got a good bottle!"
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,The Inkey List PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner - 100ml,Love the ingredient list and the experience. Inkey List does it again!
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,The Inkey List PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner - 100ml,Noticed improved facial texture after just one use! Been using it for 2 weeks now and loving it.
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Didn't see a difference,"Didn't irritate my skin or break me out, but I didn't really see a difference in my skin while using it."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Great product!,Love this toner! Super gentle on my sensitive skin and doesn’t dry out my skin at all.
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,the best!!,Absolutely amazing! I use this nightly and I’ve noticed a huge difference in my skin the last couple weeks. It’s much softer and is getting more clear. The price is an even bigger bonus! I I’ll always be repurchasing
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,The Inkey List PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner - 100ml,"Not a toner felt like water in a bottle. …………..,,,,,,,,,,,,"
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,The Inkey List PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner - 100ml,"I have very sensitive skin that has reacted to every toner I have tried except for this one! I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I don’t notice a huge huge difference in my skin, however I only use it every 2nd or 3rd day so maybe once I use it more consistently I will notice more changes. Definitely give this a try if you have sensitive and dry skin!"
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,night time go-to,"so so good, my go-to at night before some aloe and a moisturizer. helps keep my skin clear, def buying a second bottle"
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,The Inkey List PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner - 100ml,"HG. HG. HG. I've never found a chemical exfoliant gentle enough to use regularly until this one. For the past couple of days, I've used it morning and night (directly on the skin, in a small spray bottle), and the texture on my face improved dramatically. The stubborn CC's on my forehead are almost all gone.

Pros:
* Doesn't irritate or break out sensitive skin
* Great at evening out skin texture
* Softens and hydrates
* Contains 3% niacinamide (antioxidant + anti-inflammatory)

Cons:
* Like many other TIL products, the packaging sucks. I recommend decanting it. It has a thin, water-like consistency, so I use it as a mist.
* If your skin is used to stronger physical or chemical exfoliants, this probably won't be enough exfoliation for you."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,skip,Honestly didn’t do anything I went through one bottle and bought another because I really wanted it to work but it did NOTHING.
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Great Toner,I love this toner. It's super gentle but I have seen an improvement in my skin like fewer blackheads and clogged pores. I will buy more once I'm out!
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Doesn’t do anything,"I didn’t see a change at all, this product removed all of the extra dirt and dust that was on my face. But it did not clear my skin in anyway it also didn’t sting but it didn’t help or make a difference."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,"Best Exfoliator for Sensitive, Dry or Acne skin!","This product is so great. I have very fair, sensitive, dry, acne prone skin so I need to be careful with products but I still need help. I had those little bumps (closed comedones) all over my forehead, cheeks and chin. I tried everything and nothing worked. Finally I started using this once a day 5 times a week and the bumps are almost completely gone. It hasn’t dried my skin out which is amazing and it plays well with other products. If you are dry or sensitive and need some exfoliation, you need this! Highly recommend :) 
A tip: I find it better to just put some in your hand as opposed to putting it on a cotton round. You just lose to much product that way!"
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,SAVE YOUR COINS,"Didnt do anything for me.. I have acne prone, sensitive skin and i used this everyday for about 2 weeks and saw no difference. Its also expensive for what it is.. small amount and very simple cheap ingredients, i suggest using an exfoliater from ordinary!"
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,sadly doesn't do much,"i bought this as a daytime toner thinking it would help even tone and exfoliate for pores. despite using it everyday and being halfway through the bottle, I'm not convinced that it is making any difference. at least it doesn't break me out so i will continue to use it. i would recommend glycolic acid nighttime toners which i have actually seen results with and to skip on this."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Works for my brother!,I got this for my brother who has acne prone skin and a lot of blackheads. He is just starting his skincare journey so we decided to go light. This is a great product - it did clear the blackheads considerably and dried out the acne while not overly stripping his face and making it crazy dry. Overall happy with the result!
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,The Inkey List PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner - 100ml,"it's good and i think it made a difference on my skin. I just wish it came in a bigger bottle or with more product. For the amount it has, I don't think $14 is worth the money."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,New Skincare Favourite,"I've been using this for around 2-3 months now, and it has completely elevated my routine. I had gotten rid of most of my acne but still had spots/texture, and this toner cleared all of that up + made my skin completely smooth. Also, it makes all my other products stick to my face and absorb much better, so I love love love the way it feels. I'm so obsessed that I got my boyfriend hooked on it too, and the acne on his forehead has started to clear after a month of use.
Strongly recommend!"
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,My new favourite,"This product was like a miracle for me. I have the most ultra-sensitive skin, and during the winter months, it gets red, irritated, and every other product burns when I apply it on my skin. This toner feels so light, and my skin absorbs it very quickly. I can feel it is more gentle than other toners packed with alcohol. My skin feels clean and bright after using it. A bigger size would be better, but I'm definitely re-purchasing this product."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Didn't work for me,"This toner is definitely gentle...it didn't cause any breakouts or irritation on my skin but at the same time it might be too gentle?? I've been using it for a month and didn't really notice any results. I'm also not pleased with the sticky and tacky feeling this leaves on my skin after applying, which makes it difficult to layer with other products. I will not repurchase but for the price I definitely don't regret trying it."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Love the product as a deodorant BUT...,"Great product, I use it as a deodorant and to exfoliate my elbows as well. They need a tamper seal because it ALWAYS SPILLS when it arrives. I wouldn't feel comfortable using it on my face for that reason as it could be contaminated. Sephora does a great job resolving this issue but I feel bad. Honesty all it takes it to add a tamper seal to prevent liquid from spilling during shipment."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Gentle daily exfoliator - will buy again!,"Amazing, gentle, exfoliating toner! Love using this product to get rid of dry flaky texture but doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. Great go-to product that I like using almost daily."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,The Inkey List PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner - 100ml,"Love it! I’ve never found product that worked for me right away,I’m still shook. I wish this was less popular so I can buy more bottles lol. If you’re hesitating, this is your sign ✨"
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Super Gentle Exfoliant,I love how gentle this is. My skin is super sensitive to Glycolic and Salicylic Acids and this works so well to exfoliate while retaining moisture. I use it twice a day right after cleansing and while my face is still damp and have had no irritation when paired with HA and Niacinamide. I really wish the bottle was sealed better however as some leaked in transport.
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Not sure how to feel?,"Not sure how to feel with this toner tbh. I know it is raved throughout the skin care community, however, even though it's supposed to be the gentlest formula out of chemical exfoliating acids, it gives me red bumps all over when I use it. I don't even break out for a few days with say BHA or glycolic acid than I do with this one. Not sure if I can even say it has helped with exfoliating either.. Overall, I'm disappointed in this product."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Will not repurchase.,i used the entire bottle (lasted approximately a month applied every night) and i didnt notice a difference. i am giving it 2 stars for the price and b/c it didnt make my skin itchy and red like glycolic does.
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Not sure,"I don’t know how I feel about this product. I’ve been using it for almost 2 weeks, I’ve noticed a slight glow but no improvements otherwise in regards to my skin texture. In fact, I think it’s breaking me out a bit. Product has no smell and it’s super for sensitive skin no redness, etc."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,"if u find it in stock, stock up!","I can't emphasize how much I love this product. it adds such a nice plumpness to my skin, i apply it to wet/damp skin as my first step after cleansing. its very soothing to the skin and I don't experience any irritation from this product. I've been using it for a month daily."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Great product.... I wish it was sealed,"Amazing product. I noticed a huge difference in my skin texture. My only complaint is that I lost quite a bit of product during transport. Unfortunately, the product was not sealed."
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,The Inkey List PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner - 100ml,I really liked this product and would have rated it 5 stars if it came with a safety seal. Because there was no seal it leaked during transport and I lost some of the product. But other then that I really enjoyed the toner.
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Worth trying!,I have the most sensitive skin and I can use this product with no problems! I use it 1-2 times a week in the evening and I can definitely see a difference in my skin as well as feeling more moisturized.
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,The Inkey List PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner - 100ml,"Really like this PHA toner, super smooth and smells good! I have sensitive skin, this gentle exfoliating toner works very well!"
THE INKEY LIST-PHA Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Canada,Surprisingly good !,Ordered this product by mistake instead of the glycolic acid and I really like it. I don’t have sensitive skin but I was still interested in trying it anyway. It doesn’t tingle my skin at all and my skin feels super smooth! I like to use this one in the morning and the glycolic acid at night. Works amazing for my skin :)
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,Malaysia,quality product ,I used many products from this brand. This cucumber version is fantastic. I can’t get enough of it. Value for money and affordable as not only meet my expectations but exceeds it. I’ll repeat order without any doubts. Really enjoy using it. Must buy on repeats to keep replenish this. Thumbs up! 
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,Singapore,nice,Its okay. I dont see any differences on my skin and to be honest after a while i cant be bothered to use toners anymore so i am just using it because it will be a waste if i dont. 
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,Malaysia,Strong fragrance lotion,This is just a basic face toner . Nothing special and have strong fragrance . This is my first time and last time purchase . The only reason I purchased is because the price is very reasonable. 
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,Singapore,cucumber cleansing lotion,"Mario Badescu Cucumber Cleansing Lotion is ideal for oily to combination skin. It helps minimise Tzone shine while nourishing skin with essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. Oily skin gets the cooling, clarifying cleanse it needs to look healthy and revitalized. "
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,Singapore,👍👍 good,"this product does fairly well for my combination skin. no outbreaks, clarifies pretty well which does not lead to buildup of gunk. smell is kind of strong though."
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,Singapore,Ma,"Use it for hydrating for my skin , the scent is just perfect but have been using half of the bottle and not sure it really hydrated my face. Just apply it to make sure my face not that dry."
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,USA,not an effective cleanser,"I’m still not very sure how I feel about this product. It seems pretty alcohol heavy and is heavily fragranced, but it does smell good. Recently I stopped washing my face with cleanser in the morning (as a way of not stripping my skin) and I will sometimes use this as a toner right after I just wash my face with water. I feel like it’s more suitable for oily skin due to the alcohol content but I don’t know that it’s doing anything in terms of cleansing"
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,USA,Oily Skin Save,I struggled with clogged pores and acne and it helped so much. I used it day and night after cleansing and noticed it helped minimize oil production drastically. When I ran out I noticed my skin got wayyy oilier.
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,Singapore,neutral,this product is ok and like to use it when i’m having break out as this toner helps to prevent more break outs. it’s cost efficient and i will definitely recommend!
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,Singapore,not great,"I really didn't like this product. I felt it didn't cleanse properly and did nothing for my skin. It didn't smell strongly and was quite light, which were positives. "
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,USA,AMAZING!!!,"THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!! 
I struggle a lot with clogged pores and pesky blackheads from my naturally really oily skin. This product made my skin a lot less oilier and when i would use this in the morning it would prevent that afternoon fore head shine from un wanted oil. I totally recommend this product!!!! xoxox"
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,USA,I love everything about this!,"I've got oily skin, and this cucumber cleansing lotion works great for me. I especially love the easy it smells. It's like a mini aromatherapy treatment every time I use it!"
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,USA,Epic fail,"It should be advised for oily skin only. Period. Anyone with normal or dry skin - skip it. I'm normal skin (on a slightly dry side) and this was the equivalent of a Sahara desert for me. It stripped and dried my skin like crazy. But the worst of it is the smell. For all those looking for a cucumber hint - you won't find any. Very VERY artificial scent, reminded me of sth industrial. Total waste of money. If I could give it 0 stars I would."
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,2nd purchase ,"This is my second purchase item as it works on me. After using this lotion, my face feels clean and soft. 
The cotton apply with the lotion still can see many dirty from my face."

MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,USA,Mario Badescu Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,"I like this product for spot cleansing the more oilier areas of my face, like my nose and forehead. Although I wouldn't recommend using it all over if you have more sensitive skin or dry areas as it exacerbates those issues."
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,USA,LOVE IT!,Love this product! I use this every morning after washing my face and it leaves my face feeling clean & refreshed. I love the subtle scent and how much it has helped my skin. I struggle with acne and it has helped reduce redness & frequency of my breakouts a ton. I use retinol so my skin is pretty sensitive and this has never bothered my face which is a huge bonus

MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,USA,Mario Badescu Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,"My skin is sensitive and get dried out easier. I wouldn’t suggest this toner for people that have dryer skin, or sensitive because it made my face inflamed. If you dont have either It does leave your face feeling clean.

MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,USA,Good product!,This toner is pretty good and for the price it works well. It does however have alcohol in it and doesn't completely smell like cucumbers. But overall for the price its a good product.
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Okay product,"I don’t feel like it cleaned up my skin as much as it claimed it would. Nevertheless, it was gentle and I liked the smell, it’s very grandma-ish and comforting. I would want to try other toners rather than repurchasing, but if someone gave it to me as a gift I wouldn’t mind using it again."
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,USA,Mario Badescu Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,I used to use this about ten years ago but since then haven’t been able to get ahold of it. I am SO GLAD it’s back in my life!
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,USA,Wonderful cleanser,I’ve been using this for years and love it. It gently removes oil and freshens skin. I and my bf use it nightly.

MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Refreshing toner,"A refreshing toner for the skin. However, it didn't do what it claims to - which is that it removes pore clogging residue and prevents future acne problems. My acne didn't subside at all despite using this product and the Mario Badescu drying lotion. It does feel cooling to the skin though.

"
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,just the right toner ,"I’ve been using this for about a month now and I can say this leaves my skin feeling fresh. It smells like a regular toner,no fancy smell.I personally love this product."
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,doesn’t do anything in particular,When i read reviews on mario badescu products i was intrigue to try their cleansing soap and lotion.this one doesn’t do anything more than my usual drugstore cleansing lotion.the price is ok if u buy during sales but if it is full price i would not buy it again

MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,cleansing lotion,"Its not a bad product per se but just for my own preference I dont think it really does anything much for me. I would rather use a more affordable toner by another brand. The scent is alright, like cucumbers and I dont know if I am tripping but I think there are actually cucumber bits in it. Overall its meh"
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Average Skin Cleanser,"Brought it during sales period, thought of giving it a try.
It does the normal cleaning nothing much different from my other cleanse , just a very basic beginner range 
Good for those started to use skin care, basic range.
"

MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Current go to,I suffered from pore congestion and cystic acnes . And i have tried lots of toners but nothing works . I actually stopped using toners for a while till i found this . I decided to give it a go and yes i felt that this does something to my skin. I felt like this helps to get rid of impurities right after face wash. And im currently on my 4th bottle . :)
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Worth it! ,I have a very sensitive skin and this toner helps to soothe and hydrates my skin. And it controls my breakouts as well. I don’t have as much breakouts as before. It is indeed a very good toner. I am a satisfied customer. Not changing to any other! 
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Hyped product,"I have a dry to normal face, so i thought that this will help my dry plus acne face. But no! It makes my face even drier, and the smell is so unpleasant! So i give this product a go, i used it for less then 1 one & i passed it to a friend."
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Good,I have sensitive skin and this toner was gentle on my skin while leaving it moisturized but I find it a bit too gentle and I’m not a fan of the smell. I prefer the special cucumber lotion from the same brand.
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Soothing and Smoothing,"This toner also suits my skin very well. My skin is oily and dry at some parts. Using this toner, the dry part has gone. And I see some reviews suggested it to be used with the moisturise also. But I didn’t use moisturiser also my skin got better. Now I’m repeating my order for this toner and also new order for moisturiser. I love Mario Badescu!"
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,okay only ,i use it as a toner right after cleansing my face. very refreshing and it really does cleanse all the impurities thats left behind. feels like it does calm my skin a little bit but also dries my face out at the same time. better for oily skin type! 
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Best toner so far,I got this toner for my friend and she’s definitely loving this. She said this is the best toner she has ever used. And this toner makes her skin very soft like a baby’s butt. She said she’ll definitely recommend this product to others. 
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,LOVE,Love this toner!! It does help reduce the oil on my face and i somehow think it kinds of give me a glowing effect the next day. I also think it helps to brighten up my acne scars but maybe thats just me hahaha but ya i truly love this toner!
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,ms ,i used this every day and night for a week and i can already feel the difference. it calms the redness on my skin breakouts. blemishes have calmed down greatly over a week time . will definitely be back for more !
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,holy grail for combination skin!,"searching for the right toner is hard for a combination-oily skin like me. ever since i tried this toner, it became my holy grail. it leaves my skin balance, soft and supple. anyone with combination skin searching for a product that actually deliver the result should try this! "
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Toner,"It feels quite refreshing on the skin. Although I'm not particularly a fan of the smell. The smell sorta stings? It doesn't really do much in my opinion, but it doesn't break me out, so that's acceptable to me."
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Works better for oily skin,"while this brand is highly raved, i find this product to be unsuitable for my combination / dry skin. it isn't as hydration as the Biotherm Biosource 24h Hydrating & Tonifying Toner‎ which i have been using. hence i reckon it works better for oily skin?"
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,thumbs up! ,I really like this one instead of the special cucumber one. I felt that this one helps with removing any leftover dirts on your face after cleansing your face and it keeps my face feeling really fresh while the special one doesn't really feel like its doing anything. Love the scent too! 
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Part of daily skin routine!,"Definitely a must. This doesn't make your skin overly dry. My skin feels great, and I use this twice a day (at the minimum). It doesn't have a strong chemical odor which most cleansers have so that's definitely a plus! Best for oily skin!"
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Mario Badescu Cleansing Lotion,"i need a toner that is mild enough for my easily breakout skin and i heard that this brand is really good for my skintype. it is really refreshing and mild on the skin and the size is auite worth the money. it helps to clean off the excess dirt and makeup on the face too! the only downside is it is a little drying on the skin and my face is still about the same, just that not as much breakout as before."
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Very good for brightening face!,"Since using this toner, I've noticed my face become brighter and less prone to breakouts. The smell is a bit strong, like chemicals, but once you get used to it, it's alright. I like the feeling of how fresh the skin feels when I wipe this on using cotton pads afree cleansing the face. May consider buying again when this runs out."
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,My second bottle!,"This exfoliant clears off my pores perfectly, how can I tell? because it leaves it feeling fresh and light. I'm using it with the rest of Mario Badescu's acne treatment facial care. My first order was a tiny travel bottle which was damaged in the mail. Sephora was kind enough to send me a regular size bottle. Now I'm on my 2nd bottle!"
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,recommend ,This toner sits well on the skin after applying and doesnt smell too bad. The skin also doesnt feel dry after application. My skin is normal/ combination type. No breakouts or discomfort after each use
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Refreshing!,"This toner has a refreshing after-effect on my skin. Been using it for a while now. Other than feeling refreshed, it does somewhat cleans my skin as I can see a tinge of brown on the cotton pad after applying it on my face. Does not cause dryness or breakouts. "
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,LOVE THIS,I so Love this! One of the best toner i have ever use! It makes my skin so smooth and soft. It doesnt leave the sticky feeling unlike other toners. A definitely Must try toner. Will order this again. Cant wait! 
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Cleansing lotion but is a toner,"People seem to get confused with this product. It's a toner that has a dual action if not more. That being said it calms my skin, tones & removes excess dirt and /or makeup left on my skin. I also find that it complements the enzyme cleansin gel by Mario & adds radiance, evens out my skin tone & texture. However it's always sold out. Another great thing is the bottle is of a really decent size."
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Gentle & calming remedy,I read lots of reviews and raves about cucumber and how gentle and effective it does to skins that need soothing remedy. I wasn't disappointed in this concoction & it has caused my erratic combination skin to be calmer and less prone to break-outs.
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Love it!,It refresh my skin after cleansing. It doesn't sting my skin like any other lotion I've tried. I don't have any break out while using this. Good product. Smells good also. I've purchase other lotion from Mario Badescu but i guess it doesn't suit me. But this one is a good one. Thinking of repurchase 👍
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Toner,I had very bad skin inflammation on my face after being overseas for too long and the tap water and air quality wasn't good. Had alot of huge red painful zits and smaller ones all over face and a couple on my neck.My friend had recommended this to me so thought I give it a shot.My face cleared up after just one day of using this. Redness all gone and no new zits so far. It doesnt dry up your skin after application unlike many other similar products.Its really amazing~!
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,Light and pleasant ,"It's a light and refreshing toner. Smells good too! Great for all skin types.
Price is also reasonable. The one thing I love about Mario Badescu products is that it contains  very few ingredients 
which is great for our skin! "
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,A must for every skincare routine!,"To be honest, when I bought this i thought it was a cleanser. So after clarification from one of the Customer Service Rep at Luxola, it is actually a toner. I decided to keep it instead of making a return because as an avid Mario Badescu user, I found that their products are quite a miracle to my complexion. And yet again, this brand has never failed to amaze me! I have been using this toner as instructed (twice a day after using cleanser) and it has really made an improvement to my skin. After every usage, my skin feels fresh and quite smooth to the touch. This toner is quite gentle to the skin as I do not feel and stinging after application. Definitely will re-purchase because my skin feels really amazing! It also helps for acne-prone skin (such as mine) because I do feel that it reduces the redness of my pimples and acne! "
MARIO BADESCU-Cucumber Cleansing Lotion,,This is not a cleanser,"I'm not sure if your product description is accurate. I'd thought this is a cleanser since this is under the ""Face Wash & Cleanser"" section, but when i received the product and tried on it, there's no cucumber bits or anything. I saw the label behind the bottle and it states to use it will cotton pad/ball. So this should be a toner and not a cleanser! Please advise exchange! "
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,Ms,"It's make your skin smooth, radiant even without makeup or as base.  The brand Dior is my all times favourite.  Love it!"

DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,Ms,I used the old version few years ago and stopped using it since Dior discontinued the old version. Got a sample for this new version from Dior recently and I like it so decided to purchase a big bottle during Sephora sale. 
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,expensive but works,This is one of those hybrid products that works as a skincare as well as a base for makeup. I find that it works well as both a primer and a face serum. A bit pricey but worth it especially for more mature skin like mine. 
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,Breakouts,I had to throw away even though a lot of it was unused as it made my face breakout.
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,Nice bottle but useless,"A nice add on to my skincare collection but honestly, I think it's just an extra useless step in the morning routine. It smells good and doesn't make me breakout, so I don't mind finishing the bottle."
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,Love it so much,"Totally worth the price. My skin definitely looks a lot smoother after wearing this. Also, notice that my acne scars fade slowly. It’s definitely pricey but 1 pump is more than enough for me. Also, enjoying using this under my makeup as well. Will definitely re-purchase this. Just wish that sephora can sell the refill instead of the whole bottle. "
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,nice product ,"With all the mask wearing, this moisturiser is one of my favourites. I can smell the lovely scent which is not too strong as what some reviewers have commented. However I find the packaging not very good because a part of it fell when I was using it. "
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Australia,Great Birthday present,The product was a great price. the whole online experience from start to finish was great. I was worried that the product was not going to make due to being in a state that was in a Covid-19 lock down
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,Ms,I bought this for myself and essence of light for my mom. I’m not sure why this product makes my skin to breakouts and looks dull. And essence of light helped me to clear it. I would repurchase the essence of light not this. 
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,Dior Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,"Dior Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion. Good product. I apply it every morning. My face immediately look radiant and soft. I felt moisture to my oily skin, I doesn’t make my face more oily. "
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,Amazing product,"It was love at first sight, smell, texture!  An amazing product - thank you Dior! One pump is sufficient for full face and neck.  It gives a lovely muted glow to the skin.  Evens out skin tone and discolouration beautifully.  Double duty as primer with skincare ingredients.  For those ""no makeup"" days, I use this over my face with a light dusting of powder and I'm good to go."
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,im in love!! ,Its really a great product! Even though the price is quite expensive but its really worth every penny... my skin looks really good when i use this for my makeup base.. my makeup also dont crack and last longger until 9 hours.. i will continue using this. Tq Dior!!
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,Primer with skin care ingredients I ,"I have dry skin with uneven skin tone. Make up can't last for long hence want to find a primer. Tried this texture at counter, attracted by it fragrance but didn't buy it that time as I'm not sure will it suit to my skin. After wore it for hours, I know it suits to me! Bought it when members' sale. Now I just use it single without foundation with good and natural look. Although it coverages not very strong,but it is ok for me."
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,second bottle,"I love this item. This is my second bottle. Combined this with dior one essential detox serum, works well for my skin condition. Recommended for troubled skin."
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,disappointed with dior skincare again,"The texture is a bit greasy, the fragrance not really pleasant for me. It cause my face break out eventually. Quite regret to purchase this product. I have been trying dior line skincare, almost most of them quite disappointing, their ingredients seemed like not nature and not suitable to sensitive skin. "
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,Favorite ever,"I swear by this emulsion. I got it as a tester in the States and every time I used it as a primer/moisturizer, people would say my skin was glowing so I bought the full sized version and really love it. I just use a toner and then this emulsion and put my make foundation on and its great. Sometimes I use it without foundation and I do notice that my skin feels and looks glowier in any case. 

It’s really pricey but as I only use a pea sized amount each time, this could last quite a while. "
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,best,"This is my to go moisturiser on the days that I don’t wear my foundation. If you have a good skincare routine, this moisturiser will do a good job of minimise pores and providing even skin colour. Can be used as a primer as well for dry skin. Highly recommended. "
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,Ms,"Suppose to purchase Cell Energy, tried using this but caused allergy to my face, stopped using it immediately. Any chance of changing it after just single use? If not posdible for a change Its alright"

DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Malaysia,good coverage ,"Skin become smooth and pores are gone. Beautiful product and the liquid texture is nice. Not too strong and not clogging the pores. Too pricey and will buy again during Sephora sales and will be better in bigger bottle. Overall, good to create flawless skin"
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,Singapore,best of the best!,I love how this product is able to give me a very natural look on days I feel like skipping my foundation. Furthermore it has anti aging properties too! Killing 2 birds with one stone! 
DIOR-Capture Totale DreamSkin Care & Perfect Emulsion,,Great moisturizer and primer,This is a lux moisturizer and primer but does worth every cent. It literally melts into the skin giving it a healthy pearlised glow and minimise pores. Makeup goes on effortlessly and last longer after application. Great for if you can get it during Sephora sale. 
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,New Zealand,brilliant ,"Definitely a great buy! I bought this a couple of months ago and I’m not even a quarter of the way through (I use it day and night after cleansing) a little goes a long way, makes my face feel hydrated and nicely preps it for my other skincare. Highly recommend."
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Singapore,Tonique Confort,"This product prefers dry skin. For those people with large pores, you should let it cool down in the small freezes for a while before using. Then, you can apply it. That will be ok for you."
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,overpriced & overhyped,"After using for a while it turned my non sensitive skin into sensitive skin. It is a just a normal basic toner, not a good purchase if you are looking for it to do more."
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,worthy ,"This is milky and very moisturising. I am using this product for 6 months till now. I think it can also be used in this way: pour out on cotton and rest on my face like applying mask for certain areas of my face. 
"
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Singapore,Ms ,"I find this product to be mediocre - it didn’t damage my skin by any means, but it didn’t do much other than providing basic mosturizing function either. "
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,Recommended,Nice texture. On the thick side. feels comfortable on the skin. I would recommend this if you have normal or dry skin. might be too rich for those with oily skin. 
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,Ms.,"This toner suits sensitive skin and is light in texture and hydrating for a toner. Have repurchased this toner many times, love it. "
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,my review,as I use it. the product seems don't function well to my skin. it's feel something wrong when use it. buy this instead of the rose water scent as the staff recommend but it doesn't work well to me. 
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Singapore,LANCÔME Tonique Confort,"LANCÔME - Tonique Confort
This size is value for money. 
More suitable for older skin. "

LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,Major LOVE,seriously I love this toner so much!! it's super hydrating. I even stopped using essence. it does both job. like a 2 in 1 product.  plus it comes in a huge bottle and lost very long. 
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Singapore,A big Bottle,"For the price tag, it’s actually pretty worth it. It’s a gel-like texture … But sadly, it doesn’t suits my skin. My skin feels dry and slightly itchy after use."
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,a pretty good toner,"Moisturizing and smells quite nice. I like the creamy texture for my dry skin, it usually calms the redness of my blemishes. 
I must say I do prefer a better dispensing packaging like spray or a pump as this product comes our way too much everytime"

LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,Not suitable for sensitive skin,"I want to love Lancome tonique like their other products but this range made my skin reddish and breakouts after several uses. It might be suitable for normal to combination skin types but definitely not for sensitive skin. On a positive note, the scent is nice and it is a huge bottle that can last several months."
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Singapore,Worth the hype,"First time using it, not sticky at all, keep the face hydrated. My skin is normal to combination. I like the smell also. Can use as a moisturizer as well."
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,Giant bottle,I have never seen such big toner before. It's a hit sticky to use on fingertips so I usually soak a cotton pad and wipe on my face. Considered quite hydrating. Not much smell.

This toner help me to boost the level of hydrating on skin and my skin then feel comfortable and more hydrate shortly after cleansing in daily use.

LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,ms,The packaging is soooo cute. Its does make the skin feel hydrated after using it and and the radiance can be seen. Been loving it apart from the huge hole of the bottle that is likely to waste the product as it does not required that many for an application
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,toner,Agreed with the reviews here. Amazing! Been using it for a week and fell in love with this toner. it is so soft and sometimes i didnt even put moisturizer when im at home. I think this is the biggest size toner i have ever purchased - 400ml!  will def repurchase!!
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,Hydrating toner,Slightly thick but really fast absorb suitable for me who have dry skin type. For combination skin it is possible to use moisturizer on top dry areas only.
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,perfecttttttt,"Erm where do I even begin? The luxurious looks, the texture. Really up to my expectations. No wonder people have been hyping up this toner so much. Now I understand why"
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Australia,very moist ,Very soft and moist skin. My skin was bit bumpy and its all gone now. Also brighten up my skin. I use with cotton pad or just use my hand too. I will purchase again. 
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,Pink Lovers 🌸,"I love the texture of the product when I found its not oily or sticky at all. Feeling fresh when I apply it into my face. A little bit sticky for oily skin baby, however, it’s acceptable. 
Will try another product from the same range one day. Love the color, it’s pink and normally it makes ladies easy to fall in love with it. 💖"

LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,Good for dry skin,Ive been using this since the product launched until now! It moisturises my skin as i have a very dry skin. Act like toner+moisturizer. My all time fav! 
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,Major Love,This product so awesome.. It makes my skin moisture and dewy after 3rd time use.. love the smell.. i just apply this toner using hand not put in cotton pad.. will repurchase after finish this bottle.. 
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,moisturizing,"first bottle lasts for almost 6 months. It has a thicker texture compare to normal toner, and I find it quite moisturizing just use it alone, and it has a nice scent. Purchasing my second bottle. "
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,Absolute toner,"I love this toner, big bottle, worth for money, and smell nice. Reduce pore size. Sometime i only use this toner without others skin care product, feel good too."
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Singapore,Good,Definitely one of my favourite toners. Love the slightly thicker consistency and how soothing it is. Personally I find it really hydrating so after using it just accompany it with a moisturiser and you can call it a day
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,hydrating toner,"
Soooo hydrating! I think everyone needs this toner. I wash my face with a cleanser and apply it directly after I pat dry my face. It has a noticable scent but it doesn't bother me at all and hasn't irritated my sensitive skin. I recommend you guys to try it out."
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,So soft,This toner makes my face feels soft and hydrated! The gentle rose scent smells great and doesn't irritate my skin at all. Definitely gonna repurchase after I finish with the current bottle. 
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,best toner,This is the best toner i ever tried. It’s so big probably last for months. The texture is so nice and left my skin so soft and feels clean. Will definitely repurchase after i finished this one 😊
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,Doesn’t suit oily skin,"I am having oily skin, this bring breakouts for my skin. For oily skin, please use this only if you were in very low humidity country or long hour under air-conditional I have transferred to my friend. "
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Singapore,Ms,Really enjoyed using this toner. It comforts my dry skin with its milky texture and gentle rose scent. Skin feels more moisturised as compared to all the other toners that i’ve used before. Will definitely repurchase again. 
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,💛💛,"Great for my skin ! Helped with my dry skin and doesn’t clog my pores ! And the bottle size is worth the price ! But the texture of the toner is thick, so little amount is needed for one time use. "
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,Light and hydrating ,"This is my first ever lancome product. The texture is nice and easy to apply all over the face. It got a thin fruity scent, not the artificial kind of smell. Very hydrating and doesn't cause me to breakout. "
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,Malaysia,I love it! ,"My skin is dry skin so i try this one, not regret to buy the big one! it last up to 4-6 month. worth the money and i love how this toner hydrate my skin. "
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,So good!,"seems like i have oily skin, as a toner this is quite thick for me. So, i use this as a hydrating mask twice or thrice a week. For dry skin this might suits you well. Love ❤️"
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,so so only ,"Bought this due to all the good reviews i read online but i don’t find it as good as what was said about it. to me, it’s just a normal toner and does not work wonder on my skin. "
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,Holy Grail for Combi Skin ,"It is certainly a Holy Grail for me with combi skin. Despite of its milky texture, it doesn't leave any sticky feeling on the skin . Instead it is moisturizing and refreshing ! Lovin it !"
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,First time buying,"It has a rose scent which is quite disturbing (I don't like my skincare to have flowery scent). And regarding the texture, it is milky, making my face oily after usage. I probably will not repeat this purchase in future."
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,Not enough moisturising ,"Good smell, reasonable for the size but not enough moisturising for my skin. When I apply to my skin some area itchy and not suitable for sensitive skin."
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,Holy grail,"My go to beauty staples. Highly recommended! My 3rd bottles & suitable for combo skin & with the size it can last up to 3mos. So easy to apply,the end result was satisfying! No regret at all, worth d buy."
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,moisturizing,"it's a very moisturizing product, tones and evens skins so well. It isnt heavy on the face and it has such a refreshing feel. Will definitely repurchase"
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,Ms,"I've been using this toner over two decades since I was 14 as I have dry skin and am prone to millia seeds, thus non-oily skincare is a must for me. Another bonus is the sheer size of this bottle and it lasts for a super long time.

This would have to be my longest staple product in my skincare regime."
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,best toner ever,I don’t know why I haven’t used this before but this is the best! In the first week that I’ve used it I noticed my skin has less red flare ups. My skin also feels moisturized. While applying it doesn’t have a “clean feel” because of the milky feel but once it dries you feel clean and refreshed. Definitely will buy. The price is worth it!
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,Disappointment,Bought this for a friend and she said it broke her out. She has quite a sensitive skin and thus I guess it is not recommended for sensitive skin! Too bad ...
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,great texture,"Huge bottle, got a shocked when I received it. Texture is milky and works alright on me. Feels moisturised but I prefer non milky moisturiser. Smell pleasant too."
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,Love the packaging ,"The bottle is very aesthetically pleasing and the product itself is pleasant to use. It's advertised for dry skin, but it works wonders on my combination skin too. The fluid is rather viscous and not at all like a regular toner. Instead of using it with a cotton pad, I pat the toner straight on to my skin."
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,very moisturized ,"As a toner it is very moisturized and super hydrated. It has thick texture and when applying to skin, I have some sort of pinning pains, which I think it can be super moisturized. As a toner it is very moisturized and super hydrated. It has thick texture and when applying to skin, I have some sort of pinning pains, which I think it can be super moisturized."
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,Not too bad,"I have dry and sensitive skin, I don't mind this product, it has a nice texture and smell.   but I'm still looking for a better toner and a cheaper price. "
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,love love love,I never really believe in toner as part of my skincare routine but this I bought it anyway during sephora private sale and it changed my life! my skin feel soft and i notice my pores around my nose are less visible after using it for a week. I love the smell and colour too. Totally worth my money and will repurchase.
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,Soothing milky texture,"I've been using this toner for over two weeks and it doesn't feel heavy on my skin considering our warm and humid climate. Instead, it refreshes as it is cool and gentle with its pink creamy texture. I also like its clean, calming fragrance. I have combination skin yet it doesn't get my T-zone worse, just the right balance. My skin feels fresh and soft. This toner will definitely be a part of my daily routine. "
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,not bad,"totally moisturized. save amount of using. smells good. when applying it directly on the bare face that just got washed, I can feel a little bit stabbing pain on my face, which could be a problem concerning the sense of using this product."
LANCÔME-Tonique Confort,,not bad,"ordered it for a sister who has been using for a while now. stings the face when i tried but maybe my skin was dry - and this really works or helps to moisturize!  
bottle always comes without a box or packaging but at least it works well and was package with bubblewrap (online shopping and delivery), so thank you!"

CLINIQUE-Clarifying Lotion 3 - Combination Oily Skin,Malaysia,Good Toner,"This product is meant for combination skin, and it can be drying if you have only normal skin. It works well for what it claims to do. I saw a reduction / fewer breakouts after using this for about 1 week. One thing you need to get used to is the smell. It has a really weird smell because it doesn't contain fragrance."

MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Toner,"The toner is good, but pricy "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,not for me,"Didn’t like the fragrance, MB puts too much fragrance into their product. Product didn’t really work for me either, breaks me out. Dk what’s the hype about but it didn’t work for me."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Not too harsh like others glycolic toners!,My skin loves this product. My face is smoother and clearer. It’s not too strong like others glycolic toners that I’ve tried. Definitely worth a try.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Notice brighter skin,"After a bottle of Glycolic Acid Toner, I noticed my skin gets brighter especially my hyperpigmentation issues. It smells nice as I could recall, had to limit myself on toner application. After all, this product is worth trying😊"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,love love love!,"Truly one of my favorite toners. I have tried to venture into using other toners but I always come back to this product! I have been using it for years. Always adds a clean feel to my skin and leaves it radiant. Perfect for layering my serums and moisturizers, definitely adds to the glow. The bottle size is also very generous when compared to other brands."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,Good Exfoliating Toner,This is a good exfoliating toner without too much drying the skin.  Price is reasonable too.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Philippines,One of the best toners!,It's gentle on the skin but does the work!!! It doesn't sting as well which I like. Didn't break me out too!!! Planning to repurchase since I finished my bottle already.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Shopper,"The Glycolic Acid Toner by Mario Badescu is surprisingly nice! It doesn’t dry up my skin, and it leaves my skin feeling clean. The subtle scent is very pleasant too. I really like this."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Uh-okay,Beli tapi tak habis pakai. Macam tak berapa ngam dengan my skin. 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Daily mild skin peel,This product is superb for oily acne prone skin for surface peeling of dead cells to reveal a healthier skin. Also good for short mask for black heads. Melts off the blackhead for easier and scare free extractions
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,okay-ish,"Tried using this when my skin was going through a bit of a rough patch. It didn’t help my skin at all and it was so harsh my skin always felt extra dry after using it. I’ve read a lot of good reviews for this product, but it didn’t work for me. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,Beauty Junkie,I wear a LOT of makeup on a daily basis. So this helps to unclog my pores and residual makeup. My acne scars reduced a little and as a toner it does its job!
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Oddly Sticky,"Leaves a sticky residue on your skin after using - actually ended up washing my face again to rid the stickiness. Yuck. I like many Mario Badescu products, but this one is disappointing."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,loving this MB glycolic toner!,"Read a lot of good reviews, so i gave it a try. Now im loving it! Stings a bit my face during the first try. Cleanse and make my face smooth. Noticed that my blemishes minimized after weeks of using this toner. Will defo get another bottle."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,not bad,didn't use it that often but it does it work! so it base on individual if u need it otherwise I think salicylic acid cleanser only is good to use......
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,Worth it,I like Mario badescu products and this one does not disappoint me. I used it every morning and felt that my face has less blemishes. 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,Nope. ,"Heard a lot of good reviews about it but unfortunately it didn't work well for my combination skin. It stung upon application and it made my skin feel really tight and red. I don't even have sensitive skin, so I don't know what's up with this product. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,so so ,"I love the look of the packaging. Bought this for a change of new toner. It works just fine. Not too pricey. I have dry skin and this is ok for me. Smells good.
"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Good for sensitive skin,"I used it in the evening, it did reduce fine lines. Calm, not irritating at all, not causing breakouts. However, not so much on white head improvement. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,so so ,Saw a lot of good review on it but I don't really see much difference even after using it for so many months. I was so excited when purchasing it but can't see much difference evem after using it.. Skin still feel so so only 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,GAME CHANGER,I love this! I have very breakout prone skin and i use BP clindamycin during the day with Lancôme sunscreen/lotion and i use this toner before i put that stuff on and even sporadically throughout the day to clean my face! I use it also at night before i apply my prescription retin a  and haven’t ever had any irritation and have had a great success with keeping my skin clear.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Quite good,I bought this as I read that your skin would be very clean and would glow. It did that to me. I'm very happy. There are now a number of glycolic acid toners out there. This was among the first. 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,conflicted,"Sadly I don’t see any improvement in my skin condition. Maybe because I’m wearing a mask all the time? I still hve breakouts, esp on my cheeks. Hope it works out better for you. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,thank u next,Was not up to par. Stung my face and eyes. Will not buy again. Check out Lancôme for a nice toner. Or Thayers is even a better choice than this one to me.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,not working on my skin ,I’m using this for around 35 day but couldn’t see any visible changes. Maybe it’s not suitable for my skin I guess. However I won’t recommend this product as I fell it not worth the money.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Great Nighttime Toner,I use this only at night after washing my face and before my oils and moisturizer. I love this so much and can't recommend enough if you also want to have glowing skin. I recommend just using once a day (evening).
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,2% solution that works,"At 2%, it’s mildly exfoliating and perfect for nightly use. The scent is so pleasant! Doesn’t sting at all unlike the ordinary one. Unique dispenser but not too hygienic if you think about it.. the opening is exposed. One star off for that. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Philippines,Mild and effective,Been a fan of Mario Badescu products for years now and this product is as effective as the others. Mild on the skin but does the job. I make sure to hoard Mario Badescu products during sale as they tend to be a bit pricey.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Philippines,gentle enough,"i love that this glycolic acid toner isn’t as harsh as other acid toners. it also smells really good but in a clean, refreshing way and not a fragrance-packed manner. the bottle cap mechanism/design is great too as it is very secure. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner,this toner works great and feels amazing on my skin!!!
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,Alright ,"Didn’t do much for my face, little to no change. I use this on my chest instead to get rid of past acne scarring. It leaves behind a slight sticky residue but works better on my chest than on my face (my face is very sensitive to certain ingredients)"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,Ms,Not bad toner. Took quite awhile to finish a bottle but not sure if it works really well. Did not see much difference but also did not cause a breakout. So I guess it works fine as a daily toner 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Philippines,Perf for acne-prone skin,I really have an oily and acne-prone skin and this product works for me to keep my acnes manageable. It does feel a little sting on my skin but I like it that way coz I think it does its work.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Love it!,"Works really well and helped to clear up the annoying little pimples on my nose. I have an oily t-zone area and this is mostly where I use it - just a small amount, mostly at night after washing. I usually let it dry and then follow up with the rosewater spray. No sensitivity or dryness for me."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,Recommended ,This is my second purchase. I have sensitive skin. Been using this for more than 4 months already (together with acne repair kit and drying mask) and my skin is getting better with less breakouts. MB products really help fight my pimples! Recommended!
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,Mario badescu,Good for cleansing but if u put on skincare afterwards the products do not really feel like it is getting absorbed into the skin. It kinda feels like the product leaves and layer on your skin so the other products will not be very effective
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,Effective,"It's my first time using glycolic acid toner. Whenever I apply it, it stings my eyes (it's pretty strong), but other than that, I can see that it removes impurities and dislodges dirt from pores. I also like the dispenser bottle style, very convenient. Will continue to use it!"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,pros + cons !,I really like this product I mean it smells rlly good and it’s a good price for the amount of product you’re getting but if you have acne skin like I do or want to feel like really clean and have all the dirt washed off then this isn’t the one for u <3
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,cant live without it,my acne scars have reduced so much after using this and its made my skin glowy but not oily. i have sensitive skin n the first time using it was slightly painful but day 2 was better. got used to it and and it doesnt sting anymore. holy grail bc it literally cleared up my skin a lot
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Used to work better,"Been buying this for like a decade and I've recently noticed a major change in the formula and its effectiveness. First off, the original formula I'm pretty certain contained bleach or some sort of bleach like, perhaps highly acidic  product. I know this cause its potency would make my eyes burn a bit when being applied on my face and also, wiping my hands on towels, the liquid would remove some coloring off anything the liquid came in contact with. Even a drop would bleach color out. However, that formula worked better than any product I've ever used before. My pore size was reduced, my skin was smooth and I only needed to apply once or twice a week. This new formula removed the acidic/bleach content so it's no longer painful or harsh to put on. But it also reduced its effectiveness. Applying every day doesn't reduce my pores and make my skin look any better. It's better than not using it at all but they certainly changed a lot in the last bit of time."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Not for sensitive skin,I have sensitive skin. This was just too harsh for me. It caused a lot of redness on my face and was pretty drying.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Must have,This is a winner. Talk about fresh looking and glowing skin. I didn't have success with MB in the past (for some reason they didn't work for me) but this is a game changer.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Good Stuff,"This stuff is great! Even after washing my face with a sonic brush and foaming cleanser, I still get stuff off my face with this. I like that it doesn't burn like I've had with other toners and it has a mild smell to it."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner,I got this hoping it would help lighten my acne scarring. I hoped it would be a cheaper alternative to the olehendricksen glow2OH toner but this made me break out a lot - probably going to have more acne scars now
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner,My skin looks fresher with less breakouts and dullness since using this!
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,The best Toner,"This product is probably the best toner I ever use. From the simple yet effective packaging to the fast result I noticed after using it for one week. Because of the packaging, I do not need to use so much of this product and that save me quite a lot."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,not worth it,"not harmful to my skin but used for 4 months and saw no improvement, very gentle and ineffective while the ordinary’s glycolic acid toner allowed me to see results in a week!"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner,"I purchased this product because I needed a product to minimize my pores and I definitely noticed the difference. I would recommend using an oil with this product because my skin began to dry after a few uses. However, in all its a great product."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner,"This is my go-to toner always! I have fairly large pores that easily get filled with, well everything! This toner helps tremendously to keep them much cleaner & seemingly smaller. Which saves money on getting my pores cleaned out!"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner,"this caused my cheeks to get so red, not for sensitive skin"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Singapore,Gonna buy again!,It's rather pricey for a toner but a great thing is that this comes in quite a good size. I love the fact that my face feels so much cleaner after each application.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Okay,"I still need to consider whether I want to repurchase or not. I think it was OK. But not really impressed me. I can feel the different when i use this toner. I use this toner only at Night and different toner in the morning. After use,my skin feel so moisture.. Try to avoid put near eyes area due to this toner quite strong,so could make eyes a bit sore.  Already use half bottle,i still have time to see whether this product actually works on my skin or not. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Tiny bumps ,"At first, i really like it. But after all, i do think it’s not really works with my skin because of the main purpose i bought this things is to reduce my tiny bumps. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Containes dyes!,"Dyes irritated skin, threw away after using for almost a month"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Not an everyday toner ✖️,This toner made my skin feel nice and smooth at first . But after a week of use my oily skin is experiencing extreme dryness.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,This product made me a MB customer for life!,"This product is what started my life long love and relationship with MB and for good reason! Many of my friends would compliment my skin telling me it was glowing from within. And I have this product to thank for that!! Completely evened out and brightened my skin! I have been using this toner for 7 years so trust me.

I will say please beware if you have sensitive or acne prone skin. As expected, I did purge quite a bit for 2 weeks before my skin was replaced with baby new glowy skin."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Meh Toner,"I purchased this from another retailer two months ago. I must say it definitely does clean up your skin. You definitely feel that clean pore feeling after one swipe with a cotton ball. However, I found that using this was especially drying on my oily skin. I found I had grayish patches on certain parts of my skin like my cheeks. Soon after the first few weeks of using this toner, I broke out in what I thought was a purge. It was not a purge. I broke out all over my chin and got bumps on my cheeks which later turned to pimples. I will finish this bottle by using it on my nose bec it’s the only area that wasn’t negatively affected by the toner. Buyer beware. Spot treat yourself... don’t try the whole face at once."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,skin texture improved ,"Amazing toner. Suitable with my skin. What i love the most i can see my skin brighter instantly after applying it first time. Makes my skin feel smoother and it does remove impurities and maybe my dead skin cell because the cotton is dirty even though i just wash my face. 
"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,has alcohol in it - this ages you over time!!,I only use this on my nose now as I’m very into anti aging (early 30’s). Alcohol products age you over time so I switched to Saturday skin for my face. I’m going to use this until it runs out on my nose after I do blackhead removing. Seems to work well for that.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Glycolic VS Salicylic,I bought this because my regular toner Clinique Acne Solution (with Salicylic Acid) is out of stock on Sephora online and it is still MCO in Malaysia. My skin is very oily. I understand that Glycolic Acid is better suited for more matured skin and helps with anti-aging but an overall universal exfoliator. And verdict - loving it so far! Could be up to par with Clinique Acne Solution but more moisturizing than drying effect (to calm oily sebum) salicylic acid offers but it might not be a bad thing. 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,good to my skin,"I'd never been a fan of toners because I found them drying or pore clogging. Then, on a whim I decided to give this toner a try because I wanted to incorporate a subtle amount of glycolic acid into my skin routine. I've been using it for a month now and I love it! Since day one, when I wipe my face I'm left with a dirty cotton pad which means a clean face, and the most radiant complexion. I look and feel dewy but, not heavy. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Good product ,"It’s quite normal for my face to break out when i use a new product. My face skin type is combination (mostly oily ) . My skin felt ‘clean’ & my pore size minimized . But it doesn’t really remove blackhead at nose or chin areas. Overall, will purchase again ❤️"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,Malaysia,Not suitable for sensitive skin,"The first time i use it, instantly my skin went red, stinging and feels like burning. I can tell the frangrance in this product is strong. Not recommended to someone that has sensitive skin. "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner,I LOVE this toner - I’ve been looking for a GA product that wouldn’t sting my sensitive skin for so long! It clarifies after cleansing & has helped massively with my fine lines & redness!
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner,Works great. Can be very drying and caused uneven dryness on my face.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,amazing,I love this . This is so amazing ! Resize my pores! The best toner ever!
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,not bad but fragrance is too strong ,It’s a great product for those who want to start introducing glycolic acid to their skincare regime. I like how it feels but not too keen on the fragrance. 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,Must have,I have always been a Mario Badescu fan ever since 2010. Tried using this toner for a change and it was amazing! It made my skin clearer and my pores got smaller. This is a skin regimen must have!
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,great ,It was great ! Very refreshing on my skin  . Will definitely  purchase this again after I finish the product. Dosnt dry out too ! Highly recommended for those people that want to try out a good toner 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,glycolic acid toner,I love it! No drying after feeling and feel hydrated. Honestly I don’t really see any much differences after using this except one thing for sure my pores less visible 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner,I really like this product. It’s really helped my skin and it’s a decent amount for the price
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner,"I have acne prone skin , large pores oily skin dark spots  it's great for all my skin care issues I seen improvement in my skin within a couple days."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,Slowly but Surely.,"I’ve been using this product fairly consistently for about two months now and I'm loving the results! It did cause some minor bumps at the beginning but those went away within days and I read that it’s because the glycolic acid can irritate skin at first. My overall skin texture is slowly but surely improving and I recommend this if you’re looking for a product that delivers results, you just have to be patient! This is an effective product that will last a long time so give it a try!"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,smart buy. ,I was skeptical about this product but decided to purchase it due to all the good reviews--I hope I'll be glad that I did. I haven't try it yet. Hopefully it works in my face. Very fast and excellent delivery. Definitely a smart purchase! 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Favorite Toner!,Amazing product! It has been great at fighting my acne and blackheads. I still get the occasional breakout but overall it keeps my skin clean and clear.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,not for sensitive skin ,I think this is too strong for my skin so just use it for night time. But if you don’t have sensitive skin then you can definitely use this everyday. Just doesn’t work since my skin is too sensitive 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,one of the best toners ,"This is one of the best toners that I have tried by far. Although for the first few days, my skin seems to react to it I just continue using and my pimples vanished. I think this truly helped minimize the appearance of my pimples."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Cleared my skin up!!,Using this every day has cleared up my skin dramatically. Few products in my life have ever helped this much. AMAZING
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,favorite toner!,I love this toner. I do have sensitive skin and this does not affect it at all! I see a difference when I use it daily.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,Ms.,"Good product and effective it minimizes the pores and your skin visible lighter. First time to purchase, better to use with moisturizer after using, helps to unclogged the pores and makes your skin not oily, noticeable after few weeks of using the procuct."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner,"Amazing! Saved my skin that was full of acne! I experienced breakout and lots of ugly cystic acne, i bought this dude with no expectation the 2 months later my skin has cleared up significantly. If only I can show you before and after photos you would think I edited my after photo. Yup thats how amazing this product is"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,Oh Love!,Super happy with this purchase! I love the scent and I love the fact that it doesn't feel dry on my skin. It doesn't sting as well unlike other glycolic toners in the market. 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Good Gentle Toner,"So, I’m at the end of my bottles life and I have my final review. It’s good but not fantastic. 

Pros
-hydrating
-lasts awhile 
-removes oil/dirt/extra makeup well 

Cons
-doesn’t meet all my skin requirements (doesn’t help with acne) 

It’s good, it’s hydrating, it cleans, it doesn’t break me out but doesn’t HELP the breakouts if they happen. I don’t have acne a lot but when I do I want to make sure my products are helping. This toner is good for general facial toning/cleaning but I wouldn’t recommend for trying to help blemishes, redness, color pigmentation, etc."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,for oily skin,This one is needed for oily skin. I have combination skin but i felt my face dried a bit after a few use. Maybe i will use this on days that my skin is oilier than regular. It is not for a frequent use for me. Though it does help on drying pimples and lessen whiteheads. It’s still a good buy for me. Just hoped i should have started with a small bottle. 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Miracle for uneven skin tone!!!,I love this toner. I had post dermarolling hyperpigmentation and this got rid of all the dead skin that came with it in less than a week. My skin is much brighter and more even. I use this in conjunction with the Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Cleanser. My skin has never looked better.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,Holy Grail ❤️,"I’ve waited more than 2 weeks of continuous use before I wrote this review and I must say that this is the best toner for oily, combination skin. It’s gentle enough that it doesn’t sting but you will see your skin peel, exfoliate and leave your pores tighter. Used twice daily every morning and night. Make sure to balance with moisturizer when skin gets too dry and use sunscreen before sun exposure."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,Best toner ever! ,"Its not stingy. Just mild for me not like any other acid based toner. I will gonna repurchase it. Maruo badescu is really a must have brand! Thank you. 


"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,Subtle,I've always used toners that are quite harsh to my skin. And for someone who has very sensitive skin i am very careful of wat i put on my face. Mario Badescu toners are super subtle and light. Its does not burn on my skin and it has a really nice scent that makes the whole toning process refreshing.
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,Gentle exfoliating toner,"This toner is a good toner which exfoliates yet is gentle on the skin. The scent is nice but not overpowering and it does not longer long so should not affect people who dislike scents. As the glycolic acid percentage is not very strong, it takes a while to show results but it does make the skin look brighter and fresher and it did not break out my skin or cause rashes. A nice toner overall."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,Holy grail ,"Before I bought this toner, I read some positive and negative comments about this toner but for some reasons, I decided to give it a try and this is my 5th bottle lol. I really love this toner and it doesn’t dry out my skin it make it too oily. It soothes my skin perfectly and I use it every night. Love it 🥰 "
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,great,"Smells great with good cleansing power but did not see my skin improve so im not sure if its really worth this price. But overall a pretty good toner still, will not consider repurchasing"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,Didn't disappoint!,"The product is what I expected from the brand, a soothing scent with formulation that is very gentle on the skin. Very much happy with this purchase, Mario Badescu seems to not disappoint, it's suits my sensitive skin well"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,gentle to skin,"this suits my skin well I've been usinf it for 3months now, it doesn't dry very gentle on the skin. It even helps reduce the oiliness of my face and lightens as well the blemishes."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,amazing for dry skin,"I LOVE this toner. I noticed improvements in my skin after one use. It’s incredible. 

The key with good, quality toners is to not use too much or too often. I only use this at night (and use something lighter in the morning), and I don’t use a lot. A little goes a long way here. 

All in all, really great for my dry skin (that over produces oil to mask the dryness and leads to breakouts).

I will be buying this again."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Must have!,"Before I purchased this, I was breaking out all the time. Sometimes I would break out from over washing my face and it was just a mess. I was soooo sensitive to breakouts. I purchased this two months ago and my life will never be the same!!! My skin is so smooth now, it fixed the weird texture that my forehead had. I don’t have to worry if I eat something unhealthy, if it will make me breakout. I literally feel like this eliminated my acne."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,Best for the Price,"I used Pixi Glow Tonic’s glycolic acid toner before this. I can say that Mario Badescu’s toner gave me better results, it’s also cheaper and you get more than similar brands!"
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,One of the best I have tried,I love how this toner is gently lifts aways dead skin on my face with its glycolic acid component. I look instantly refreshed right after applying this. It is one of my staples in my nightly beauty ritual. 
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,does it job,it does it job but it leaves my skin quite drying but overall is okay. maybe it just not for my combination skin type btw the smell is pleasant.......
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,USA,works wonders!,"This is the best toner I’ve ever tried! I broke out really badly on my chin and cheek and in less than 2 weeks this cleared up my skin significantly! Ofc I still have spots, but this brought down the bumps a lot.
Another thing I love about it is how clean it leaves your skin. It’s amazing how much dirt your cleanser still leaves. I personally love to see on the cotton pad how much was cleaned out. I definitely recommend this product for acne prone skin."
MARIO BADESCU-Glycolic Acid Toner,,Toner,Mario Badescu products are simply amazing. The toner lasted me for about 3 months. Every swipe of this toner works like magic on the skin. Face got more brighter and spots and marks were much lighter with continuous use.
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Singapore,Vitamin C Tonic,Bought this for my mom and she loves it. She said that she feels a diff after using it for awhile now. It makes her skin look brighter after constant use.
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,recommended product to apply on,The toners main purpose is to brighten and soothe the skin. I feel that it's very hydrating too and it does a good job in prepping the skin before applying the next step of this range. 
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Singapore,amazing ,Got to love this! It actually helped to clear and brighten up my skin. One of my favs! However you definitely need to have the patience to wait and use this diligently to see any difference in your skin. My skin became brighter after using this for close to a month. 
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Singapore,vitc tonic,I hv sensitive skin...the product suits my skin...its alcohol free too...smoothes the skin&skin glows...it has been one of my favorite brand...good recommendation to others too
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Singapore,i guess it’s ok?,"the vitamin c in the product works well for me and it has a very cooling feeling but makes my skin rather oily. for normal and dry skin types this would be great for you
 "
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,okay-ish,"as there's a vit c trend going on so i bought this to try out. it's not bad, exfoliates well but the major issue is with the packaging. transparent packaging thumbs down. vit c in sunlight can react miserably. hope pixi takes care of the matter in future. "
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,vitamins for skin ,Love the citrus smell. I love this brand and it always deliver with a dewy smooth skin. Reduce of dark spots and less sticky on my face. I can see differences in my skin
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,bad for acne,bad bad bad for my acne. had to stop using this toner after fews days cuz acne are popping everywhere thank god I bought the smallest size . I guess this tonic is good for dry skin 
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,New Zealand,dry ,I tried adding this to my morning routine but unfortunately it just dried out my skin :( took over a week to get my skin back to normal. Won’t be purchasing again
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,Great Toner,"Great Toner, will purchase in future. there is a glow on skin"
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Australia,meh,"This was good but not life changing. I prefer my kiehls calendula toner, I used this as I liked the price point. No real difference and not great ingredients "
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,Love Love Love,Holy grail for dull skin! 🤩 Currently my favourite toner & smells so fresh too. I used to alternate with other toner but I must say my skin looks better with only this tonic as my toner! But it really depends on your skin type ya! ✌🏻 
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,Mad Love,"With frequent use, my skin is glowing and noticeably brighter too! Currently, I only use this tonic as my toner as I love it so much. If you have sensitive skin, you might want to alternate with more gentle toner. This is must have-essential product for dull skin! 🤩"
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Singapore,glowy skin,It is super good and my skin is glowing after a couple of use!! Really recommend u guys to buy this !! Good for my skin type which is dry and sensitive 
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Singapore,Awesome ,it's hard to find tonic that is suitable for my skin. This product is amazing and the Vitamic C is exactly what I need. it's not prickly at all. it's very gentle on my skin
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Australia,love it !,"Absolutely love this product ! Will definitely repurchase and recommend to others !

I was recommended this toner by a MUA at Sephora and have never looked back !
      
"
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Australia,Good,"I like this a lot. It is probably one of my favourite toners. It smells good, applies well and feels good on the skin. I love vitamin c. I recommend this for those with mild to moderate skin concerns."
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,m,"Before buying this full size, i Bought the small bottle of 100ml. Its an okay product. Used this product at night. Glow tonic during the day. As long as it doesnt break out my skin then i think its fine."
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Singapore,MUST HAVE EVERY DAY,"Part of my daily routine. I use this every morning after washing my face. The Vitamin C Tonic makes my skin feel fresh and awake. It has a sweet and pleasant citrus scent. I keep it away from sunlight as I read Vit C may lose potency or turn colour otherwise. 
I feel as though my face does get brighter immediately after using it, but I cannot confirm if it really does."
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,Skin so clear,"Not the best but i like it. If you find something to maintain your skin condition that having minimal problems, this is the product. If you have chronic condition, discuss with dermatologist. I love this, suitable for asian skin."
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,Great Product,This is my first time with this brand. Just used it for few days so as for now i can't tell about the result but it doesn't ruin or irritated my skin at all and that is good enough for now. The scent is okay and not that strong for me
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Singapore,awesome,"Ive been using this many years, it really removeds long wear type of foundation and make up. Minimizes the oil into my face. No dull skin after using this cleanser it leaves my face radiant and clean after applying, good to recommend."
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,How long it will take to show the result? ,"I've been using this since 3 weeks ago. Haven't seen so much on brightening effect but it makes my skin breakouts with small tiny bumps. However, my blackheads and Whiteheads were reduced. "
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Australia,amazing ,"was looking to add a toner/tonic to my routine so decided to start with this and am happy with the results. It cleans all the dirt from my face and leaves me feel bright and fresh. I will probably try a different one next time but for young skin or people new to the skin game, this a great one to start with."
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Australia,here at toner,I love this toner. I use it every night in my skin care routine. I have noticed my skin looks brighter and definitely less breakouts. The smell is also so nice. I’ve tried a few of the pixi tonics but this one is my fave by far!
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,Vitamin-Glow! ,"Value for money as its light, and really did brighten my skin and even out my skin tone. Absorbs into akin quickly and results noticeable after 5 days. "
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,great,Works great on my oily and acne prone skin. So glad i gave this a try. Been eyeing on this for a long time and worth my money. Totally recommended if youre struggling with dull skin
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Singapore,good,Smell is good. I guess it works well for brightening and toning. The price is good.......................................................................
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Singapore,Ms.,"Vitamin C is best used with Ferulic acid and this product offers exactly that. Has a citrusy fragrance. Use it as a toner and notice reduction in dark spots and a brighter, more even skin tone"
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,ms,Reviews says it smells nice. But i dont know why at first it smells great and turn stinks after awhile. Hate it. But overall the product is okay. First time trying this. But i use retinol n glow tonic over the years.
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Singapore,Can’t tell the effect,"Not really sure what this product does on my skin. I used this as a toner in the morning. Almost finish with the bottle, but didn’t help much on lightening acne scars. Might not be buying this product again."
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Australia,great price and great product ,"I really like this toner, I was on the hunt for something that was affordable with vitamin c in it and this was available so I snatched it up not thinking I’d be soo impressed with it but wow I think everyone should try it if they are also after a vitamin c product that’s affordable. It took a while for me to notice the most improvement due to it being a toner and vitamin c it won’t happen overnight but after a bit I noticed a change in my acne scars and pigmentation and it stopped making a difference and then I persisted and notice more of a difference once again. Absolutely worth it. Didn’t leave me feeling greasy or glowy at all so suitable for oily skin people like me. I’m sure there are other products that are better but they come with a higher price tag so I’m satisfied with this product. "
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,brighten up my skin,First time buying this product. What can i say this product is very great product. Not regret buying this as it also help to brighten up my dull skin. 
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,Brighten,This product very goood!! It gives my skin shine bright like a diamond and flawless! But be careful some ingredients might not suit with u guys okie. But for now my skin love it! help recover my dark spot either 
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Australia,Great product,This is a great product. It has helped with my pigmentation and makes my skin look brighter and healthy. I use this every second morning after cleansing and before moisturising. I think I will repurchase this again.
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Singapore,vita c, I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate. I saw difference to my skin after using it I would say that my skin does look a bit brighter and healthier
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Australia,Cui,"This product does have Vitamin C , which gives it a very refreshing fragrance. Currently I am using it every morning. Purly for the smell , it wakes me up  . Sometimes I had lots on the cottong pad and have my DIY maks at nighttime. My skin felt brighten and calm. It absorbed quickly and leves a very hydragting feeling. Now it made me feel interesting in other toner/ mist. I am happy to purchase it again after i finished my current bottle."
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,Nice!,"I have been using this for almost 2 months now and I do see some difference in brightening my skin, just that I feel it works better with the caviar balm and masque. using it alone will take more time. love the smell too! Though its good, sunscreen is a must if you're using vit c range."
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,Good,It's a feel good toner but can't really see the difference. Mine got oxidized before I could finish the bottle but will repurchase again  to give it another try. 
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Australia,Pixie Toner,"love it, i really do feel it brightens my skin and smells quite nice. I love the cooling sensation and how it feels being applied to my skin. I would recommend. "
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Australia,okay...,Has an overpowering citrus scent that is really sweet but doesn’t belong to a skin care item. I’ve also been using this for around a month and have seen negligible results if any.... I’m looking into purchasing the glow tonic as it seems more promising....
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,Miss,I love it! My new scars getting faded day by day after using this toner! Good result if using with PIXI Vitamin C cream. I definitely to buy it again.
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,must have!,"Must have for everyone! Superb toner,  can get instant glow after few seconds. This is my third purchase of this product and I can’t get enough of this. & I love the citrusy scent!
"
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Singapore,vitamin c tonic,"Vitamin C tonic! Love this item my skin feels soft and clean after used, and it makes my skin glowy,fresh and radiant...this is my 5 times purchase on this tonic. "
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Singapore,Mad Love!,"Glow Tonic, what? This should be the cult toner from Pixi! Vitamin C leaves skin youthful looking and glowing not to mention helping boost up body's collagen! So this totally made my skin firmer and supple! After only 1 week of use once a day, my skin has a healthy glow, and looks fresh! My pigmentation has also lightened and I am loving the look... But I do match this with Dr Dennis Gross' peels before and Mario Badescu's Vitamin C Serum after... My skin is at its best right now! Will definitely keep repurchasing!"
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,nice,"I LOVE testing out new beauty product !!Thanks for all the great reviews !! It really suits for me personally .. Will restock again in future .. And it was a fast delivey .. Thank you so much Sephora .. 
"
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,Malaysia,1st purchase,"make my face glowing after few days using it. but I don't like the strong citrus smell. But it doesn't really bother me. Good product, definitely worth my money"
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,,Fragrance feels like an issue,Nice toner and feels lovely going on. The amount of fragrance I can smell worries me a bit because it makes me think there's a lot of perfume in there. However it's definitely brightening and super nice to use.
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,,it’s alright. ,This was okayish product for me. I have been using Pixi glow tonic for months now and it does wonders to my skin and I decided to switch to this thinking it would be up to that mark but it’s not. It tones my skin but not brighten or make it glow. It is pretty much like your drug store toner
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,,glowy,"I have to use this only at night time as I get oily easily, and it doesn’t control oil. but do notice a difference! It makes skin glowy and bright, and smells beautiful. "
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,,Not really works,"Smells like vitamin C indeed, but i’m not really like that smell😣 . I’m not sure if this product work for me. I’ve been using it for a month but i don’t feel any differences on my skin :( So, i decided to give the product to my sister, hope it will works on her!"
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,,love it,"love the product, I feel amazing different in my skin , day by day improve my skin, before dull and pigmentations but now glowing and clear skin. thanks sephora  for this lovely product. "
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,,vitamin c tonic,"Nothing great about this toner, didn’t make any difference on me after nearly 2 weeks of use, it does tingle a lot but goes away and very itchy if mistakenly goes in eyes , dont know why is this stuff so over hyped, thank God i bought smAll size"
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,,amazing ,"I love this toner, it’s one of best toner I’ve used in a while. It doesn’t leave your skin feeling dry and it’s also smells good haha. I would highly recommend it if you’re currently looking for a new toner, it will leave your skin with natural glows. "
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,,Glowing skin,"Quick absorbing
No residual stickiness on face after application
Smell not too overpowering
Noticeable glow and smoothness to skin
Small amount goes a long way
"
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,,this has to be one of the most amazing toners i have ever used!,"This is one of the best toner i have used. I use it daily. However i do not use a cotton pad, i pour 4-5 drops on my hand and apply as a lotion and it has shown alot of great results in just the 1st 3 weeks. Im on my 2nd month and still i love it."
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,,Great but not a need,"It’s a great product, makes my skin glow. I stopped using foundation everyday since using this, but it is just a primer. You can use it’s good, but you don’t NEED to have it. Nothing to write home about. "
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,,Love it!!,"Skin looks bright after using it, pigmentation seems to be getting light as well.                                                                           "
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,,love the toner,I love pixi vitamin-c tonic because it can make my skin look better.. Also can make my skin look brighter. My acne scar looks brighter too. Love the product
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,,Love this! ,I was hoping Pixi would sell this in a larger size as I love this toner so much! This helps to brighten my skin back after I've got a pretty bad burn on my face after a long beach holiday. It also helps to shrunk my acne (acne scar gonna took sometime I think) after couple of day. I was just hoping that they'll came in a larger bottle as the glow tonic! 
PIXI-Vitamin-C Tonic,,smells like citrus candy,"eventhough i would have loved it scentless, but this stuff instantly brightens my skin. it literally smells like citrus candy. very seeet. i need to use it more and update my review after finishing up this bottle. "
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Malaysia,Good!,"Purchased this as the glow tonic was out of stock. After months, i can see the difference even using it not even half of the bottle. My skin becomes brighter and it fades the pimple scars. Good purchased after all!"
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Singapore,THIS WORKS!,"i have normal/oily, acne-prone skin. have lots of post acne scarring/pigmentation too and this toner is slowly but surely clearing it up! skin is visibly brighter the next morning, works wonders on my active zits too."
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Singapore,Effective toner,This works better than the Glow Tonic toner for me! I can feel the difference in my skin the following morning when I use this. It absorbs really quickly too!
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Malaysia,PIXI Clarifying Toner,"This toner has literally changed my skincare game. I had aggressive hormonal acne that would never go away. This toner has reduced almost 90% of my breakouts. My skin now breakouts very rarely around that time of the month. Other than that, I feel my skin is normally very clear because of this magical product "
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Malaysia,Pixi is worth it,"Decided to try this toner after looking up reviews and I'm so glad I think! If you've oily/combination acne-prone skin, I highly recommend this toner instead of the other popular pixi one."
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Singapore,love this toner!,"I have a normal and oily t-zone skin. I have been looking for a toner that does not strip off the oil but at the same time regulate oil and sebum production. took a leap of faith, saw that it contains some amazing ingredients to help with my skin concerns. 
I love it!"
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Singapore,100 ml - it works!,"Been using this for a month & it worked so well for me. Really helps with clearing up dark spots and acne marks, & prevents my breakouts in the long run. Definitely buying another bottle. "
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Singapore,Really works,"The place where I go for facials has some fancy computer that assesses the condition of your skin. I didn’t have a facial for a long time because of the pandemic and started using this toner in the meantime. When I went back after almost 1 year the computer said my skin improved a lot, so the toner must be doing *something* right!

I also like that it’s fragrance free. The oil control isn’t that good though. It only gives me 1 extra hour of shine-free time compared to cleansing and then applying nothing.

My only complaint is the screw top lid is a bit inconvenient to use, flip top or pump would be better."
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Singapore,pixi tonic clarifying ,"Very mild and calming on the face. Removes all impurities and doesn’t irritates my skin. From using harsh astringents, finally was able to find a suitable toner that will not strip away natural oils from my skin. "
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Singapore,Effective toner,"Overall, I do seem to be getting fewer flaws and I can see that my nose blackheads are getting better! A side effect is that it can be a little drying so just use more moisturiser then usual. And compared to the glow tonic (Loved it), there is lesser glow~ It really depends on what you’re looking for!"
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Singapore,Good Product,this is my 2nd bottle purchase for this toner. was recommended by sephora sales adviser when I'm looking for toner. glad that I took her advice. i often had outbreaks and this toner helps to dry my pimples fast 
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Malaysia,life saverrrr,"i struggled with uneven skin texture and this really helped to fix those stubborn little spotsss and bonus points since it’s hyram approved :) it doesn’t have a scent to it and i find that it’s best to apply without cotton pads for some reason. but it’s really beneficial for my skin type. i’m more towards normal, but at times it can be dry, at times it can be more on the oily side. and yet it still works wondersss"
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Singapore,No different on my skin.,Tried but not for my skin as it sting my skin everytime I applied it on my skin and no different on my skin. I guess this is not for sensitive skin type.
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Singapore,second bottle!,"Bought the 100ml bottle the previous time and i love it! I have buildups of whitehead/blackheads and sebums at my nose area. This toner really really helps! Andd when your facial cleanser doesn’t clean your face thoroughly, these toner will do the job instead."
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Singapore,new favourtie,"I have very oily and white/blackhead prone nose and this really helped! It’s not drying and when i use this at night after cleansing, it really removes all the excess makeup/other dirty stuff that my cleanser didn’t wash off! Highly recommended for those who is whitehead/blackhead prone "
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Malaysia,Pixi,A bit strong for my skin and a bit sting but I felt my skin a bit smooth after use this. Hopefully this will work well with my skin for long term use. 
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Malaysia,Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner 250ml,"I've been using glow tonic previously until this is launched. So, I decided to give it a try. In comparison, I think glow tonic is much more effective in treating acne than this. But for daily use, this is must gentle. Would continue to monitor. "
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Malaysia,Clarity Tonic,I like this better than glow tonic. Both have glycolic acid but i prefer this one more cus it doesn’t sting. I use it twice a day. Really helps to reduce my acne. Already my second bottle. 
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Malaysia,great ,"I bought this to try since there’s quite a lot of good reviews. I prefer this so much more compared to Glow Tonic, as this has no fragrance and is very very gentle on skin. I use it daily day and night "
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Singapore,pixie clarifying toner ,"Have not got around to using it, but judging from the ingredients, it should be effective and safe to use. I like the packaging , it is light and not easily broken "
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Malaysia,Amazing ,This is one of the staple products in any skincare enthusiast kit. Been hearing raving reviews about this and I’ve been loving it. The size is also convenient for travel 
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Singapore,not bad,tried glow tonic and decided to try this clarity tonic toner and it helps to lighten my acne and maskne. used it twice a day and is one of my go to skincare routine 
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Singapore,love it! ,I love this more than the glow tonic. It does not sting and dries out acnes without irritation. I'd definitely but another one. Thumbs up for this product! 
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Malaysia,nice but pricey,"Have been using for a few months now and finished the small bottle. It really helped on controlling my acne skin and gives decent hydration, might come back when I need it again haha"
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Singapore,Works a charm ,"I appreciate that this toner is effective without stinging the skin. Granted the actives are in lower concentrations, but a gentle treatment often is far better than a harsh one applied on occasion.
After Dr Dennis Gross, Pixi has got to be a close favourite. Love it."
PIXI-Skintreats Clarity Tonic Clarifying Toner,Australia,Part of daily skincare regieme,"I bought this after reading Caroline Hirons' Skincare book & seeing her video about ""maskne"". As a healthcare worker needing to wear a mask all day I invested in this recommendation and so far, so good!"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Malaysia,Smelly but good,This smells like straight up vinegar and stings during the first several uses but it leaves my skin looking clear. Quite effective I might say and I’m on my second bottle now
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Malaysia,best,Its an amazing product to be honest. Been using sometime. Worked great and gentle on skin. Will definitely keep purchasing it. Holy grail for me! Amazing!!!!!!! Love it.                             Love.         
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,This stuff is the BOMB,"I tried the sample version of this about a year ago and LOVED it instantly. It does exactly ad the name suggests, it tingles. It tingles A LOT, but your skin adjusts to it. However, after just one use my skin is so smooth, and the texture that my skin usually has is gone! The ingredients in this product really clean out your pores! This is by far, the best best toner I’ve ever used."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,New Zealand,Best stuff ever!,"I have been battling acme since I was a teenager. I'm now 31 and have found this stuff. Cannot live without it! I used to suffer cystic acne but since using this, ive not had one cyst! it destroys  spots overnight!!"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Malaysia,Great toner,"Great toner. It does work well to fade my scar marks. My skin looks better. First time on skin, it is a bit irritating but several time use to it. Unfortunately the smell is very strong. Still be able to handle the smell because it's work amazingly "
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,The Vinegar Treatment Toner’s more like it lol,BARELY tingles to me but that could be cuz my skin is very used to skin actives (chemical exfoliants etc.) but it does seem to be a great toner. Smells like straight vinegar so theres that
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,MAGIC IN A BOTTLE,"First and foremost you must follow the directions. Gently apply this to a dry face. Then let it fully dry before putting any other skincare on top. Otherwise it will burn. However, if you do it right it’s dream skin!"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,Oily acne prone skin,"Let’s start by saying yes it has a very mild vinegar smell upon application but it fades quick and once you do a serum or moisturizer over it, you really never knew. It’s not oily or thick. It’s a thin water like texture. Yes it did sting mildly for 1 minute or less. Overall it’s helping with my acne, still need to use it a little longer to see the other benefits. I’ve been using tretinion for a year but I now alternate with this toner at night. Only because tretinoin does not cover all my skin request. I knock off one star only because I want to use it longer than a month to really see the benefits but so far so good. Dry or sensitive skin might want to get a sample 1st and patch test to see if it irritates or drys them out too much"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Malaysia,ms,Awesome product. Cheap but good quality. I used it alternating with retinol. Easy to apply. Will try the serum version in next purchase. Recommended item to buy. 
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Malaysia,the best toner,works wonder on my hormonal acne. tried so many brands from drugs store up to dermatology clinic.. this knockout formula.. works very well with my skin.. blackhead and whitehead also less visible.. on my second bottle already
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,really good results!,"first off, this product is definitely NOT for sensitive skin or for those who haven’t used acids on their skin before. it’s very strong and should be used with caution. HOWEVER, i’ve been using this product about 2-3x a week and feel like it has worked wonders at keeping my hormonal breakouts away as well as keeping my pores clear. this toner always makes my skin look super glowy and bright after i use it. the only downside to this product is that it does tend to leave a somewhat sticky finish, but it usually goes away after moisturizing. definitely recommend if you have issues with clogged pores/acne! if you’ve never used a product like this before, i’d recommend starting w/ applying it 1x/week followed by a heavy moisturizer."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,A  MUST HAVE,"This is essential in my skincare routine. Please keep in mind IT TAKES TIME. I have sensitive, dry skin and am able to use this. It does ""burn"" at first which is why it's called a tingling treatment but it really is effective. Just remember that you're working with acid so don't use products that will counteract and don't use on broken skin."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Australia,great toner/ exfoliant,"really enjoy this product. it is both, a really good toner and having a mix of acids, great exfoliant as well. over all very happy with it and will purchase again"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Australia,great product ,"I have purchased this twice now. It helps really well with oil production and prominent pores. Only using it 2 x week, so the little size goes a long way"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment - 50ml,"Yeah, it tingles, but I'm not sure it's making anything better.  If I use it more than once in a while, it seems to trigger more breakouts in previously non-breakout areas."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,Effective if not a bit painful,"I’ve used this for a few years now, and it’s very good at exfoliating and leaving you with smooth skin. However, it’s too strong for me nowadays as I now use tretinoin in my routine. Would recommend for non-sensitive skin types!"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Malaysia,So Worth It,"I've been using this for months now and keep buying bottles. Yes it is itchy when you initially put it on, but I've learnt to like it. Why? Because the effects for your skin are like... tightened pores, clean, stamp out the breakouts. And I have definitely struggled with acne-prone skin all my life. Yeah its expensive, and it doesn't smell nice, but for me, the trade-off is so minor compared to what it gives me. Can't recommend this enough! I tend to use it only at night and make sure I moisturise during the day. If you want an extra glow, then use this and a serum at night. "
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,love love,Love this stuff! You can feel it right away working..it’s evened out my skin tone dramatically..I have these darker marks on my cheek bones ..I think sun damage ..buts it has lightened them up so so much! I love Tarte skincare stuff any and all of it!
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Australia,Wow,"This treatment is absolutely amazing, I use it twice a week because it’s strong but it does the job and more. I love it and lasts so long. "
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment - 150ml,"I got a sample size at first but after using that up, bought a full size. It has helped the look and feel of my skin and it’s my go-to toner. Great for my combination skin"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Australia,ehhh,"Was very harsh on my skin, gave it a weird texture and made my skin break out. I stopped using this product after a week. Do not recommend. Love other products from Tarte "
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,HOLY GRAIL PRODUCT,"I will be honest, this product smells like plain out vinegar and stings at first. However, don't let the smell turn you away from it. I have struggled with hormonal acne for YEARS and this toner has cleared out my acne and dark spots. I have acne-prone combination skin, every single product I've tried out has broken me out horribly, except the Tarte KnockOut Line. 

This entire skincare line is my holy grail and cannot recommend it enough, if you have the budget I would also recommend purchasing the moisturizer. you can buy the travel-sized versions of the KnockOut Line to try it out if beforehand if you still have your doubts."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment - 50ml,"I agree with reviewer Liloahanna: after 40, my skin went bananas. All of a sudden, I had dry skin and hormonal acne after having neither for two decades. This toner smells AWFUL, like, yes, you will be the stinky kid in the room (or you’ll swear you are): all I can smell is the sulfur when I use it. It also turns my skin pink and slightly tight for a full day after using. That being said, it works. If I use this one day at the start of a week I know my face will be breaking out, it wards off 98% of the acne. Between the slight reaction and the stench, I feel like a masochist reordering it, but until my skin returns to “normal” again, it will continue to be on my list."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,2 minutes of mild discomfort for perfect skin.,"Sure it has a little burn and it smells funny, but if you can suffer 2 minutes of mild discomfort, your skin will thank you the next day. I've never seen such a dramatic improvement in my skin texture. I will never not have this."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Malaysia,definitely tingles,"probably the only product which actually minimized the appearance of my sebaceous filaments. it tingles, hurts a little in the beginning, but I definitely see the difference when it help with breakouts and acne"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Australia,must have ,"I tried this as a beauty buys freebie and I wouldn't be without it now.
It's so refreshing and tightening and diminishes texture and pores.
My absolute favourite toner and it smells pleasant too.
My favourite Tarte product. "
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,"acne, dermatitis & folliculitis fighter","I got this because Folliculitis Scout website recommends it and they’re super strict so their advice is gold to me. They recommended a salicylic acid toner which works great for daily use but I wanted something stronger for a treatment when I have flare ups. This toner is the one! My pores look so cute and tiny and my closed comedones have left the building! Also my maskne is finally GONE!

Smell: Acetic acid is listed halfway down the ingredients which is vinegar so a subtle vinegar scent is to be expected. For me it’s completely a non-issue, I didn’t even notice it except that I read the other reviews. Even if I pay attention to it, it’s barely noticeable and it’s gone as soon as it dries. 

Advice: your first time using this, apply it and then rinse it off and then do your moisturizer - wait a few days before trying again, you need to acclimate your skin to this. Gradually work your way up to leaving it on longer and/or more frequently. If you have sensitive skin, maybe always do the rinse off method."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,Awful smell,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This smells like apple cider vinegar. I had multiple samples of this but it smelled so bad I only used one.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment - 150ml,This is a really nice product because it takes away your pimples and Really works. But I would suggest to use it once or twice a week because you’re scared and start to Flake
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,Effective,Definitely does tingle (burn may also be a good word) the first few times I used it but it gets more bearable. Do not use with a retinol or if you are using Differin! Reduces the amount and lessens the redness of my acne.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,THIS WORKS!,"I bought this because I was struggling so bad with under the skin acne. This saved my skin. I saw results within 2 weeks, my skin texture is more even and my acne is clear. If you’re sensitive to smell this won’t be for you because it doesn’t smell good, but it works. It says to use once a week but I use it every night my skin can’t live without it. I see a hugeee difference when I don’t use this product in my routine. A actual life saver. Highly highly recommend!"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment - 150ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Face is on fire after using the sample of this, my face burns and itches. DO NOT USE if you have any sensitive skin reactions at all. I hope this goes away soon..."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,Recommended,"The smell of this product isn’t pleasant. However, it works wonders. I have very sensitive skin and this product with moderate use gives me glowing skin! Magic in a bottle."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,Love It,"Removes what make up wipes and cleanser leave behind, leaves skin feeling soft, and even complexion!"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,Becareful!,"I would not recommand this product on skin like mine. I have healthy skin, a little sensitive, but this product smell bad, it feels like burning my skin and leave my face red for half an hour. I’m affraid it could destroy natural skin lipidic's barriere. Please try a patch test on forearm before using it on your face."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment - 150ml,"Holy cow! This is a workout for your skin. I received a deluxe sample with purchase, and it's going to last me quite awhile. It really does attack your imperfections (blemishes, those little white bumps, and texture created by scars and dead skin). It does burn. My skin can handle most things, but this is tough on me. I need to use it every other day. If you have sensitive skin this is going to be too strong for you. I will be purchasing the full size. You HAVE to use a moisturizer after this, it does strip your skin. I took off one star because of the awful smell being right on your face."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment - 150ml,This product smells so awful that I had to wash my face after using it. The smell is so bad that I won’t be giving it a second chance.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,smells terrible,The smells is absolutely disgusting. Like I just wiped vinegar on my face.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,best toner I've ever tried,I got the mini bottle as a birthday gift a couple years back and just recently got the large bottle. 10/10 would recommend this to anyone with combination skin it makes my skin noticeably glow to the point where a male coworker of mine pointed it out. Feels so good I look forward to using it everyday.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment - 150ml,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Got this as a sample and I’m glad I didn’t pay for it. Stank like vinegar and I threw it out after one use.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,A crap,"Got it as a sample size, and smell horrible, like vinegar. Why would you need a tingling toner to resurface your skin when out there bunch of items can help. Even the strongest aha toner i’m using - The ordinary glycolic acid 7% isn’t that bad. even when i wash it away, it still burns my eyes"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,Better than Accutane!,"This made the difference in stopping my acne when accutane and multiple months of antibiotics had failed. For reference I am 50 white and suffer with hormonal and cystic acne. Very painful! As long as I remember to splash this on once every other day my breakouts are minimised or non existant. No kidding even the thousands of spent at the derm can't do that! The downside is that it stings like a freaking bear. But after Accutane failed I was literally ready to try anything.  You're scan does acclimate to it after about a week and you don't get the sunburn redness anymore. I even have a pretty high pain tolerance but this stings like a bi-atch,  so I splash it on (from palm not cotton) and rinse it off with cold water after 30 seconds to a minute. That seems to have solved the whole problem it still seems just as effective as if I were to suffer through leaving it on all night. I am telling you.... you need to run, don't walk, to get this stuff if you have acne... cystic acne, or hormonal/monthly. This will literally knock them out. (btw I paid for the product myself). on 3rd bottle but one lasts about 6 months!!!"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,Sauerkraut toner,It smells just like sauerkraut. It wouldn't be so bad if the scent didn't linger. Can't tell if it's my face that smells or if its like how bleach gets stuck in your nose.  I just used it for the first time and immediately knew I had to check the reviews to see what in the suerkraut was happening just to ensure it wasn't expired or something.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,sting,It definitely stings your face but it works . make sure you put moisturizer on after or before .
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,Do not get this,"Trust me when I say do not purchase this, it listerally smells so bad and it attracts bugs. I had it for like a week and I tried using it but little black things were coming out on my cotton ball so I looked through the tiny hole and there was a TON of little may flies I almost threw up and threw it out immediately"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,very unpleasant to use,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Its very unpleasant, do not buy if you have a low pain tolourace. it does work but might compormize your sleep that night. if you dont enjoy your skin brunning off i work reccomend the paulas choice 2% BHA AHA exfoilater, it works wonders and doesnt hurt. you will purge with both products those, your skin will get worst before it gets better. there is lots of youtube videos on skin purging if this is your first time chemicaly exfoilating. This is not a good product for beginners, again try the paulas choice 2% BHA AHA."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,overnight change,I received this as a sample and used it once and in one night my small bumps were almost all gone!!!!! I used so much different products to find something that could help my skin and this finally did.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,Smells Horrible,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I haven't had too many issues with stinging/redness and it DOES help get rid of the excess oil on my face before applying foundation, but...

The smell makes my stomach churn. It smells like burning hair and chemicals. Just a drop not only makes my face smell horrible but the whole room. I'm assuming it has to do with the fact that it contains sulfur, but I'm not sure. I straight up cannot use it anymore. I'm glad I got this as a free sample."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,stinky!!!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I got a sample of this and BOY does it ever smell bad. Very strong vinegar smell, I almost thought my sample had gone bad but judging from other reviews, it’s just the way it smells. 

The tingle was quite strong at first, so if you’re sensitive to to that kind of thing or sensitive to smells, I’d avoid this product."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,"Dry, sensitive skin beware",Made my dry skin dryer. Occasionally hurt if I used it too frequently. Didnt like the smell. Didn't notice any results.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,Best toner,This product works very well. I have sensitive skin and use it every 2-3 nights even though it can be used daily. The only downside is the scent isn’t great but that’s not the point of the product! I give it a 4 since the price point could be a little less.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment - 150ml,This product was very harsh on my skin and made me breakout and dry up at the same time.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,A MUST HAVE,"I love this product so much. It is supposed to tingle, and it does not smell good but I didn't purchase this item for the purpose of making my face smell nice. It INSTANTLY brighten and smooths my skin. I've repurchased this three times. However, I would not recommend this for people with sensitive skin."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,Works great even with sensitive skin,"I've been using this for a couple of years now and it's really improved my skin. I have fair, sensitive, relatively dry skin and through some trial and error figured out how to use it best for me- put a little bit on a cotton round, lightly swiping ONLY on the areas I normally get breakouts, and only using it a couple of days a week (usually every other day). Killed my cystic & hormonal cheek breakouts in like a week and I've been using it since. You MUST let it dry for a couple of minutes before you seal it in with moisturizer or your skin will turn bright red and burn. It's a good product but only if you use it in the best way for your skin type. If you have sensitive skin I'd recommend starting by using it every 2-3 days or so and working your way up."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,I love it for brightening & texture,"I really love this product. I purchased when I was looking for something to help with texture and brightness, and after seeing Samantha Ravendahl rave about this I decided to give it a shot. I do think it helped clear up the texture issues I was having, and I use it probably 1-2x a week now whenever I feel my skin needs a little extra glow - this product works wonders for that, when I apply it at night my skin is noticeably brighter the next day. It's an acidic toner that smells... acidic, which is nothing to complain too much about (I wasn't expecting anything less) - just don't breathe through your nose when applying this and your skin will thank you later! For reference I have very dry skin and this does not irritate me at all."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Australia,nice product maybe not worth the money,"It’s quite a nice product, you feel clean and fresh applying it to your skin. However, I can’t say I noticed a difference in my skin whatsoever. So it’s hard to recommend a $60 toner based on that "
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Australia,actually shrinks down my huge nose/cheek pores! ,the very first time I used this my skin was pretty red and angry but I've never had a reaction since. I've been using this for around 3 years now and I'll get complacent about it then run out and not use any for a few weeks and feel like my pores are growing large enough to engulf a planet that is when I truly notice how much this stuff helps! I have skin that can be sensitive so the initial reaction being the only one has been a blessing for how good this is!
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Australia,no joke,"Wow this stuff is the real deal! No messing around with this product, it actually works and does an amazing job at combating those annoying breakouts. It does have a tingle feeling when it’s on the skin but it doesn’t last too long. Just be mindful on how much you use as I did have some sort of reaction and my skin went really red. It calmed down after 5 minutes but I did get overly excited and put heaps on, which I now know you don’t need to do that for it to work. Love this product!"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,New Zealand,Love it,I got this to try in a sample size first and when tried- I fell in love with this tingling treatment that I ended up buying 150ml. It does tingle a bit but is bearable.It helped with my acne n combination skin without giving me any dry patches.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,A lifesaver for this girl in her 40s,"Exactly what I’ve been looking for. First off, I’m 45, and I’m leading with that because I swear once you hit 40, your skin challenges change. Long gone are the days where you can maybe skip moisturizing a couple days and still feel like you can see a glow. For the past 2 years I have tried all the new and best that have come around (the entire Drunk Elephant line, Tatcha, La Mer… the list goes on), and even though all of those have had their shining moments in my skin care routine, their effectiveness has diminished over time and I surrendered to the fact that I was just never going to get that youthful glow back in my skin I took for granted in my 20s and 30s. Well let me tell you this, after just using this 2 nights in a row before bed, I feel like there has been a dramatic change. After 1 week, all the little bumps I had on my chin line … gone … all the dullness around my cheeks… gone. 
I just got the moisturizer and am so excited to add that to my night routine. I did notice some dryness after day 12 but skipped a day and had no other issues. Love this stuff as a woman in my 40s. Thankful it’s also not a crazy price."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment - 50ml,"This product changed my dry skin to eventually almost oily skin type after I finished the bottle, not sure how I feel about that?  Does tingle, I did find it helped my skin if you use it as directions say.  Didn’t irritate my dry sensitive skin.  You have to wait for it to completely dry before applying next step in your skincare routine!"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,magic!,"This stuff is amazing! I had to write a review bc I’m 40 and my skin looks like glass. Yes it tingles/itches for about 5 min. Only go over your face once. Don’t wipe several times or scrub- that will irritate your skin. And put it on a cotton pad. That’s what works for me. When I look at the cotton pad afterwards, I can see the dirt and skin that it wiped off- even though I already cleansed my face. It’s like magic I swear! I only used it about once a week. But I never want to use a manual scrub again. I’m all about this!"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment - 50ml,So so good! My skin is always noticeably clearer & smoother the morning after I apply this in the evening. This is one of my favorite skin care products!
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Australia,amazing ,Amazing product. Massively helped acne over night!! Pimples shrank and calmed down. It’s price is great too! I will definitely buy this again and try the other products in this range 
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,knocked out my acne in one night,"I never think to write reviews. But felt compelled here. I received a trial size, applied after washing. At first you don’t feel the tingling, then it comes on slowly, like pin needle pokes. Then, your face turns bright red like a sunburn. You’re not meant to go near eyes, so for me, I could definitely see the redness where my eyes remained white and the rest of my face was bright red. I did not follow up with my regular nighttime cream, afraid I would be over doing it. Instead, I applied a soothing emu oil and went to sleep with my regular blotchy face, tiny pimples from rosacea, and reddened skin. 

But I awoke to absolute magic. No redness. Smooth skin without any tiny bumps or dry patches. I don’t know if any long term effects from using, but I’ve never had something “knockout” my rosacea bumps in one night. Now I’m here to purchase the full size and noticed all of the negative reviews. My skin is used to acids, perhaps that’s why it didn’t cause continued irritation. Or perhaps it was the soothing emu oil that I applied after and let that be the only after product I used until morning."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,not for lightweights…,"I have sensitive skin and if I follow the directions and don’t go over the same area twice it works awesome! I am a heavyweight because I’m old. Acids, retinol etc. plz be careful. Also use to exfoliate my armpits twice a week. Be careful though. (Do a test spot overnight before trying. There are a lot of other acids besides glycolic and lactic in there)"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Singapore,Awesome!,"Great chemical exfoliator. I’ve tried a few others since it was previously unavailable in SG, but thankfully it is now. This is the best for my previously dry (now normal) face"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,not very satisfied,very very harsh on the face it stings more than it tingles
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment - 50ml,I take great care of my skin and can tolerate almost any product. Tried this one time and it ruined my skin for a week (skin feels like sandpaper despite everything - even dermaplane). I regret trying the sample I received.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment - 50ml,One of my samples. Felt fine after applying. Two days later my skin was like sandpaper. Still dried out after 4 days. Is it supposed to peel now? No benefit that I can see.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Australia,Holy grail,"This exfoliator is a holy grail product for me. I use it twice a week on my combination hormonal acne prone skin. I’ll never be without knockout in my routine 

"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,Miracle product (for bad skin that can handle it),"If you're 25 with perfect skin, wanting some frou-frou toner that feels and smells like a spa, this ain't it. If your skin doesn't play nice with acid treatments, pass.

But if you have a 40+ year old face that's been beaten up by a lifetime of stubborn acne, dark spots, clogged pores, and years of products that did nothing, read on.

After a month of this treatment, I could go out without makeup for the first time in, well, ever. I still look my age, but my skin hasn't been this clear, smooth, and bright since I was 13.

Bumps on forehead - gone. Perma-zits on chin - bye. Dark spots and acne scars - fading. I can finally use heftier moisturizers without my skin being a clogged wreck within a week.

I mean, I get it - this product apparently isn't for everyone, but if your skin is a chronic mess and isn't too sensitive, it may be for you."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Australia,My Holy Grail product,"I will preface with this product is VERY STRONG for newcomers to skincare, so don’t overdo it or use it consecutive days to start with. The smell is very strong and it can have quite the burn in the beginning, but I was quickly able to tolerate daily use and the stinging didn’t occur once my skin had adjusted - but please listen to your skin, everyone is different! Amazing product - I can count on it to get rid of any bumps that may begin to appear within a few days, and it has helped to blur a lot of scarring I’ve had for many years. Amazing and will always have this product in my arsenal!
"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment - 50ml,"I did not experience tingling- it was more like needles pricking my entire face. It also made my skin itch, and as other people said, it was sticky after drying until I put moisturizer over it. I didn't notice a positive change in my skin after using. Overall, there are many better toners out there in my opinion- just because you feel something when you put it on does mean it's doing anything useful."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,Pure witch hazel,"I'm surprised to read other reviews that said they felt the tingle.  I received a sample from sephora and had high hopes for this.  Sadly, there was zero tingle.  Just a packet of witch hazel.  Did absolutely nothing.  Would not purchase."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,Holy grail product!!!!,I never write reviews. This is truly the best skin clearing product I’ve ever tried. I have very sensitive skin. I had awful hormonal/cystic acne along my jaw line. The first time I used this my face turned RED and burned and I thought I burned my skin. The next morning my skin had never looked better. It felt like magic. The burn is worth it. Acne is gone. I’m on my third bottle of this.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,It's a no for me,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This gave me an itchy rash accompanied with a weird sticky film to seal it in :(
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,Best Toner I’ve Ever Used,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I got a sample of this with my Sephora order. I have acne prone, combination skin. My skin always has pimples on it but after one use I love this product. 
I was surprised at how much “tingling” this product caused because usually companies like to oversell how well the product works but this product in particular lives up to its name. 
Instantly after applying it over my skin felt SO smooth!! Yes, the product does not smell the best but I woke up today and my skin is STILL smooth. My skin has never felt this soft before!! I would recommend to only use this at night and maybe only a few times a week because it is strong."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment - 50ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) My skin isn’t sensitive, I typically can trial any lotions/serums/toners/ahas etc without any skin reaction. I know the product say it tingles (and I have tried products that ie will cause initial tingling/burning sensation). The tingling did resolve but throughout the day, I just want to wrip my skin off because of how itchy it made my skin feel. I couldn’t wait to get home and remove this product because I couldn’t stop rubbing my face. I am glad I receive samples whenever I order other supplies because that’s when you can test out products and unfortunately it wasn’t worth it for me."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,Not a fan,This smells gross and stings a bit after applying.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment - 50ml,"I received a sample of this and was excited to try it out because I love other Tarte products. However, I could not get over the smell and had to stop using after a couple days. It has a very strong vinegar like smell. This product may work for others, but if you’re sensitive to scents, this one might not be the best option for you."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Australia,amazing product!,I when I first bought this I started with every second day but quickly moved to once a day. I don’t have overly sensitive skin but I do have very open pores that are prone to blackheads. This stops them before they become and issue. It makes my pores less visible and definitely helps with brightness too! I’ve already re-purchased the large bottle. I love it!
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Australia,Really strong,"I am used to acid toners and that is my preferred method of exfoliation.
However this was strong even for me.
It stings and burns for a few minutes before calming down.
I notice I develop some bumps on my chin when I use this too often.
It does a great job at smoothing out my skin though.
And it works wonderfully at smoothing out my keratosis pilaris."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,QUICK FIX FOR COMBO SKIN,"I have combination oily/dry skin and I wouldn’t say I have the most sensitive or acne prone skin out there BUT when I do break out, it’s never just one little blemish..it breaks out everywhere! I use this at night more as a “treatment”
toner and this honestly helps the blemishes disappear within 48 hours. Would definitely recommend if you’re someone who needs a quick fix here or there for less sensitive skin."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Australia,Such an effective exfoliant! ,"I’ve tried many exfoliants in the past, but this is my favourite. It’s strong, but doesn’t irritate my skin with 2-3x a week use. In the morning after applying this the night before, my skin feels so smooth and glass-like! The bottle is huge and lasts forever, so it’s great value for money too!"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,Best toner on the market!,"I’ve been using this since it came out. Yes it smells dreadful (no irritating perfume added to mask the natural scent), but it’s the best toner on the market. No alcohol, gentle acids to exfoliate, reasonably priced, and it comes in regular and travel sizes. It tingles, it’s supposed to tingle, but most skin types will be able to tolerate it very well. I’m crazy about this stuff!"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Australia,Mixed bag,"When I first started using this it was great, a really good, affordable replacement for expensive exfoliators and it helped with my acne. Unfortunately over time I started reacting to it and I even got these awful bumps in between my fingers when I applied it using my hands. I definitely recommend applying it with cotton buds and remembering a little goes a long way because it's potent."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,not worth it,"I have been using this product for about a month, initially it worked great and breakouts calmed down. Then I started to have reactions to it, face turning bright red and hot for 2 days like I had a sunburn in the middle of winter, and constant itchy face. Plus this stuff smells like straight vinegar."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,Great product!!!,Great product. I usually use it when I start getting acne’s. My skin has become soft!!
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,Holy Grail,I’ve tried several different chemical exfoliants but always come back to Knockout. It does sting when my skin is adjusting to it but after about a week of use my skin doesn’t sting or turn red anymore. It seems to help my skin absorb other products and I find that I wake up with glowing skin when I use it consistently. I have very dry skin and don’t get pimples often but I still find this product to be beneficial.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,Nice and strong!,"I started using this for hormonal breakouts, and it has helped tremendously! This toner is too strong for me to use everyday because it has a strong acid blend. I have combination skin that is acne prone but get dry easily. It does sting like a professional peel when you first apply it, but it does help clear breakouts!"
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,Stings but works,This stuff stings.. a LOT. But I see the best results from this toner & i’ve tried lots!
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,tarte Knockout Tingling Treatment - 150ml,"I got this as a free sample probably a year ago and didn't have a need for it because my skin was clear. Over the past few months my skin has been struggling with ""mascne"" and stopping oral contraceptives. Almost nothing works for me for cystic acne, but this stuff along with a good cleansing routine has really helped! The first time I used it did make my whole face pretty red, but it doesn't do that anymore. I use it a few times a week and notice it really reduces the inflammation around my pimples and redness. If I run out of the sample, and still have to deal with acne I will buy again."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,YES!! It works!,"Very effective way to gently exfoliate all the dead skin off your face. Not super strong - you might get a little tingle, depending on how sensitive your skin is. I use it every other night. That light brown colour on your cotton pad? Dead Skin!! I wait for a few minutes then follow with my fave night cream. Great stuff. More effective than some of the less expensive options."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,stings a lot!!,"I regularly use AHAs and other acidic products, but this one stings a *lot* and smells exactly like a very strong vingear."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Canada,Turned good skin bad,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Put this on my face after washing. (I have relatively good skin- not oily, small pores, just the odd break-out here and there). After about 3 hours my face felt like it couldn't breath so I washed it off. It had turned my cheeks so red it looked like I had a rash. The next morning was the same, except now I looked like I had a sunburn (In January). Still waiting for my face to go back to normal. I didn't feel like my skin was any more or less oily, and it didn't feel more 'firm' by any means. I've never had a reaction to any skin product before until this. I dumped it all down the sink and threw it out. Save yourself the money and get a drugstore toner instead. Not worth it."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Australia,Adult acne survivor,"I love this product, its true you need to use it regularly/daily to see an all over change but I find that using it as soon as I can see or feel acne coming on can pretty much clear it up overnight. I also use it right after removing makeup and it seems to save my eczema prone skin from reacting."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,The MOST underrated acid product!,"This is the absolutely most underrated acid exfoliant on the market. Yes, it smells bad. Horrible actually, like vinegar. But that's what you get when you don't add irritating flowery perfumes to a product-they smell like their actives. But nothing whatsoever compares to the softness I feel THE NEXT DAY after using this product. It's so easy to apply and use in conjunction with other products because it's a toner consistency and then I can layer and layer on moisturizer on my dry, sensitive skin."
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,Australia,Definitely tingles,This product does what it says in the way of it definitely tingles on your face! I'm not really sure of the benefits as I didn't really notice any other than my skin stinging on application. Not sure that it was worth the price.
TARTE-Knockout Tingling Treatment,USA,"Good but strong, so be careful","This is a pretty strong exfoliant. I got a pretty bad burn when I first started using it. I had to stop using it for a week for my skin to heal. Now my face still turns pink after I use it, it gets back to normal after a couple of mins. I have to use it every other day to give my skin a day to recover, but it has helped me with hyperpigmentation and it keeps my skin glowing and soft. Using this with Ordinary retinoid 2% has completely cleared any cystic acne and I have not got another one since. For a more gentle exfoliant I would recommend Paulas Choice."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,nice,work well with my skin type………….been using this since 2020 ..literally worth buying !!🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Singapore,Average,"I purchase this item as I have breakouts on my chin area for wearing mask for very long hours. After using for 2 weeks, my pimples did not really subside. So this product might not works on my skin."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Singapore,Refreshing but drying ,"It is refreshing and felt like it did shrink the smaller bumps. But after multiple use, I feel like it is too drying and does not really do more. New acne still appears and i could not finish the big bottle as it dries my skin too much. perhaps would work for teenagers but not someone in their 30s with hormonal acne. "
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Singapore,ms,"This item does NOTHING for my face but dries my face out. I would reccomend spending your money elsewhere, not worth anything. Go purchase elsewhere and see what if ueori buy the one then 
"
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Brunei,1st Time,"My first time trying the brand. So far, doesn't disappoint. This coupled with the enzyme cleansing gel."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,special cucumber lotion,"I got this product after the recommendation of one of the staff. It didn’t break me out, but i didn’t see any difference on my skin as well. I don’t think I will repurchase "
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Singapore,Fresh like cucumber,"Bought this for my boyfriend and he likes it. Compared to other toner that he used before, this product did not cause his acne to outbreak. Would recommend people with sensitive skin to try it."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,Ms,This product works for my teen. Repeat purchase many times. Bye Bye acne!
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Singapore,hmmmmmm…….,I’m not too sure how I feel about this. Kinda feels like I’m putting cucumber water on my skin. Doesn’t really do much for me. Results is just meh. There are other products in this line that are way more worth my coin
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Singapore,nice ,i am quite a fan of mario’s products because i feel that their products are more natural and contain less fragrance. skin feels clean and refreshed after using their range of skincare.
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,Awesome!,"The only toner works well to my skin! I cannot shift to any other product! I've been using since last year. My skin is combination skin, during period sebum is so active and my skin is very oily , the toner help to control it very well!
"
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,happier skin,"Been using this for over 2 weeks now, and i can say my skin is happier. I have oily and acne prone skin. My skin was okay but since covid and staying up late my face broke out. Since using this product, my face is happier, i still have acne scar here and there but hey, its still an improvement! Just and fyi, pairing this with Inkey niacinamide and neutrogena hydro boost moisturiser. "
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Singapore,miss,"I use it after cleansing my face every night, my skin feels refreshing and clean. My skin is quite sensitive and this products works well for me though it does have the alcohol smell.  "
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Philippines,Summer go-to,"Loved it! Not sticky, perfect for summer! And the scent is good as well..its mild on the face and its refreshing..definitely highly recommended especially for tropical countries"
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Singapore,helpful ,Definitely will recommend it  to someone having troubles with ance or want to prevent break out because it really is a lifesaver for me.                
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,Holy grail,"I looooove this solution! Initially bought this as I wanted to start practising proper skin care.  I have oily skin and large pores which has always been an issue for me.  Started using this for about 2 weeks at night and my skin felt much softer,  smoother and my pores shrunk significantly. Best part would be the compliment my girl friends gave upon seeing me after month of using this. "
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,so so ,I have a combination skin. Been using this for 2 months but i did not see any changes in my skin. My acne still came out. But the bottle is big and worth the penny. 
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,toner,"I was used this product already 3 times, and i love that smell and good for my skin, the texture of this not really watering and very absorbing! Those who looking for toner, you can try this but i suggest Mario Badescu need to have small bottle for beginners or starter."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,Acceptable Toner,Been using this toner for few days now. Not much difference I can see. Will continue to use and hope it clears and minimize my pores as it claims to be. Will not repurchase. 
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,amazing! ,So inlove! Third time purchasing this product! First time bought at sephora store. Works well on my skin.... So repeat again for the second and third time thank you so much hehehe 
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Singapore,i love this!,Really makes my face feels clean and helo my maskne to dissappear. Mario badescu products are really good and Im so impressed! Will try other products they have!
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Singapore,nothing special,It didn’t do anything for my skin. I see no results after applying it for a week. There was this weird scent to it. What a waste of money. There are much better toners out there. Skip this 
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Philippines,Effective,This is an effective facial toner to treat acne. Been using it for a month now and my face is now more clear. Will definitely purchase again. Thank you.
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Philippines,Accountant,Bye bye oiliness! This is so far my favorite after-cleansing product. I am acne prone and it really helped calm my pimples with every wash. Will definitely have this wherever I go.
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,USA,nice but not lotion,"I think it's a good product, but it shouldn't be called lotion. The second ingredient is isopropyl alcohol which is pretty drying. I personally have very oily skin, and i used it  occasionally when I had pimples. Despite that the packaging was really nice and didn't spill or anything even while traveling! I think you may as well mix rubbing alcohol and water to cutout all the unnecessary ingredients like fragrance and dyes. :)"
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Singapore,My Miracle Potion,"I have acne prone, sensitive and oily skin and this is the miracle potion to calm my skin. I use it as a toner and in my DIY face mask sometimes. Whenever I feel like I am having a breakout, I pour few drops in cotton pads and apply vitamin c serum & cream on the face  and cover the soaked cotton pads like a face mask at night time for 20 or 30 mins. It calms the breakout the next morning. Of course, you need to do it for 2 or 3 times a week to see the result. You will finish the bottom faster this way but it’s worth it.
"
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,Good product,"After applied this toner, my skin feels like settle down and relax. It helps for my sensitive skin. Using this product for years aldy. Will continue purchasing it. "
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,great,"This product is so great and worth buying, I sweat to god you will never regret purchasing this lotion! It’s also affordable and last long :) does not has weird smell"
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Singapore,Good Product, Good Product. It is my second bottle. Have been using it since i received. Have a strong smell but I am fine with it. Recommended for people with acne prone or oily skin.
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,Not bad at all,"I believe this is a toner/astringent that helps to sanitize and hydrates the skin before the next skincare step. It works but since it has exfoliating benefits, this probably might not suit dry or sensitive skin especially when used daily. However if used sparingly perhaps once every two weeks would be fine or as a treatment lotion instead."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,All the blemishes are gone!!!,This product is very suitable for acne prone or oily skin. I have acne scars and normally blemishes at my chin area but i used this product for nearly one month and i can see all the blemishes were reduced! I recommend people use cotton pads to apply it 
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,Soothing,"I loved this product! It wasn't too harsh on my skin like some toners. It smelled great, felt super refreshing and did its job in making my skin feel clean. "
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,USA,Really bad shipping service,"I boutgh this product here because I was ordering some other stuff BUT it came half full, it was all over the bag and it seemed open. I love the product but I don’t recommend to buy it here. I just lost half of the product."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Singapore,Good Product,"I’ve been using this product for years. It’s good, doesn’t cause breakouts and a safe option for me to use. The scent is quite strong, which I am not fond of."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,not suitable for oily skin,"first time using this brand, not really like its chemical-like smell, its kind of drying your skin, may be not suitable  for combi/oily skin, would not reconsider this though, sorry mario."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,USA,Best lotion ever.,"Smell so good! If you read carefully is for oily skin so if you have normar or dry skin don’t try it and then complain, this lotion works perfectly, smells so good and leave my skin so clean and fresh, I LOVE IT."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,my 2nd time,"this is my 2nd time using this, i try a small one. bcs one to try. and its really work on my skin and i really love it. after using the 1st bottle i try change to Rose , but got tinny bump on forehead. damn !!! 😭😭 then i quickly changes to this cucumber back. "
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,The best toner ever.,"purchased my 5th bottle. the mario badescu special cucumber lotion toner literally saved my skin.
These toners are highly recommended for people with sensitive/acne prone skin. Pack with salycilic acid as their base and are great for relieving active acne discomforts. MAGIC "
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,Love it.,My first time using these toner. I used MB acne facial cleanser together with these toner. It doesn’t sticky on skin and pour a little bit on the cotton pad is enough for the whole face. Will repurchase if it works on my acne skin. 
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,an ok-ok product,"It does its job, though there aren't any drastic changes. it's good for daily use, it has a cooling feeling when applied onto but has an alcohol scent which can be a bit uncomfortable for some. It is a big bottle so It can be used for a while, I say it's worth the price."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Singapore,soothing & cleanses impurities very well!,Some lotion leaves sticky feeling and I hate it. but this definitely don’t. And it wipes away the impurities after your normal cleaning routine for real. Not harsh on the skin at all.  I was trying the acne kit and it came in a small bottle. I finished it and had to repurchase without hesitation.
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,Okay..,I purchased it for my husband and I. We use it after cleansing our face by applying a little bit on a cotton pad.... we have to apply moisturiser right after as we feel like our skin is a bit tighten. 
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,good product,"“I love your products. I have been using them for just over a week now and I can see and feel the difference in my skin. I wish I had found you sooner. I could ramble on about how each product is, but they are all just excellent and I am recommending them to everyone I know.”"
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,Mario badescu ,"Hello lovelies, to be very honest after using this as a toner my acne started fading and drying. This is good for acne prone skin. Just using it for 2 weeks I can feel the change . Smell is not good though, but it works wonders . "
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Singapore,Average,I use this as my skincare facial toner it was good for the first few months until I had bad breakouts and this toner could not do its magic on my sensitive skin anymore. Will recommend this as your toner if you have a normal/combi skin!
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,Malaysia,Good for acne skin ,"Hi, this is my second purchased for Cucumber Special lotion after using Acne Starter Kit. I can see my acne reduce, then I decided to grab big bottle and its absolutely worth it. "
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,suitable for my skin,"This Special Cucumber Lotion definitely changes my skin for the better. Its so cooling and gentle on my skin, i have been having less and less breakout thanks to this. It doesn’t leave a stinging feeling like other toner does.

MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,love this toner!,i love how this toner makes my skin feel squeaky clean after using. after sometime using this toner i feel like my acnes and pimples are reduced. this toner also does not give a feeling of traction on my face. major love!
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Great Toner ,It is a must have toner. Very soothing. It won’t clog pores. Skin feels smooth and fresh. Quantity is also good for the price. Really worth it. Won’t regret buying it.

"
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,USA,Mario Badescu Special Cucumber Lotion,Really enjoy this product and will continue to purchase it.
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,*big voice* TONER,this was big and I found it surprising and funny. I love it! I put this together with my 50ml sample toner and it was so so big i laughed. This is super effective for my face together with the acne facial cleanser. i found the skin care for my skin. thank you!
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,USA,Mario Badescu Special Cucumber Lotion,"This is WAY too drying for my skin (normal/dry) even in the summer when I get oily in my t-zone- I bought this when I was first getting into skincare and didn't know about how ingredients lists work, but now it's obvious since alcohol is one of the first few ingredients listed, meaning there's a huge amount of it in there. Maybe this works for acne-prone or oily skin types, but for me this is a huge thumbs down"
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,great,It is really working on pore and skin tone. It makes less appearance of pore especially after acne cleanser from Mario and followed by acne serum and oil free moisturiser however all acne products make skin dry so better use moisturiser or hydrating mask.this is my third purchase.
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Not that great but there's value for the amount. ,"I used it for a few months but I've stopped now, there's still at least 50% left. It's definitely soothing. However, I don't think I would repurchase it because it didn't really do much to my skin other than soothing it. "
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Special just like what it says! ,I love this product! It keeps my combination and acne prone skin under control. It’s not too strong nor too mild. Perfect balance that keep my skin moist but not oily throughout the day. 
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,its soothing my face,"quite nice, smells good. it makes my face feels soft. i like it! besides my face did not having any breakout after using this toner. also it makes my face soft and not producing too much oil daily.
"
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,refreshing,"first tried with the acne set, and now my fave toner. the cucumber scent is very refreshing, and the products  really gets dirt even after what I thought was already a thorough cleansing. "
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Helped calm my Cystic Acne,"it does what it says! i have mild cystic acne and occasional siya lumalabas, I had a clear skin when I was young, i don't know kung bakit nagkaka pimps ako and late 20's na dumating until now. :( but when I tried this (MB products) it helped calm my cystic acne together with Acne Non-Foaming Gel Cleanser, kinda pricey but it's worth it! You should try the MB Acne Starter Kit for you to know if MB products does match your skin type."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,so so,Doesnt make my skin feel tight after applying. However no obvious effect on me and doesnt do much to help clearing my acnes. Wont be repurchasing as I believe there are better toners out there.
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Refreshing,"Lovely fresh scent that is not too overpowering. Great feel on the skin. Good for night and day, and other products (creams, primers) work well on top. 
"
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Gentle but great for skin,"Used this a toner after using the acne facial wash. It’s gentle on my skin, doesn’t make it dry. Does its job well to further clarify my skin. Definitely worth the purchase"
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Love this! ,I have super sensitive skin and my skin gets red everytime after I wash. this definitely helped soothe my skin and leaves it fresh and clean. it's my 3rd bottle so far! 
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,cucumber lotion,does what it says. after using it i had no breakouts and calmed my skin down a lot. product smells great and can use for quite a long time. will repurchase again :) 
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,MD,Mario Badescu Special Cucumber Lotion is very soothing to my acne prone skin. It removes irritation and calms my face. I need this all the time especially after a stressful day at work.
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Great Help,"Definetely my go to toner, especially when I got breakouts due to my hormones. It helps reduce the redness of a fresh acne. I would absolutely recommend this especially the acne kit."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,USA,Mario Badescu Special Cucumber Lotion,Love this product use every single night very soothing to the skin not harsh at all
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,must have!,Love this special cucumber lotion! And the smell too. It really cleanse my skin! I can’t sleep without using this product! Perfect for combination skin
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Feedback,Really good product quality! Item delivered with safety protection! I love this product so much.. Its works at my first trial! Cant wait to see another level result
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,worth it ,"It is definitely one of the best product for people that have tendency to breakout. But bear in mind, it doesn’t necessarily suits your skin. Know your type of skin first aight !"
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,my second bottle,"This is my holy grail in terms of toners, it has mild formula on it that doesnt sting, even a little, it doesnt have strong smell which I dont like, and mario badescu has been helping me on my way to clear face!! "
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,cucumber lotion,my first time trying was when I bought the acne starter kit. the starter kit i used it for full 2 month and i totally loved it. so I decided to but full size. it does not make your skin stings. lessen my oily skin issue and does not dries up my skin. 
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,love this! fave toner,Been using this for almost 5 months now and i finished only 1/4 of it. It’s such a great buy & it’s the toner that works for me — i tried a lot alreads. I have oily skin and acne on my cheeks and chin and this does its job controlling it (compared to my previous toners)!! 
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,best toner for oily skin,"Purchased and re-purchased this product probably 6 times and counting. I just love how it makes my skin feel refreshed and cooling after using it. If you apply a generous amount on a cotton pad, it helps with tightening your pores too. However this product contains alcohol so it’s definitely more appropriate for oily skin rather than dry/sensitive skin."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,all time fac,"Having bad breakout and acne? I suggest this lovely, soothing toner. They have trial set and use that if you have doubt this product but really not regret any single cents of buting this. Loving it for my skin. Really great and love the smell."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,great price great product,This toner I get to know from internet as people recommended for oily skin like me. It actually give a cooling feeling for your skin but the way i didn’t feel it have oil control function. Great for hydration but not to oil control.
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Mediocre,"I bought this together with the cleanser and lotion. I love the smell and the after effect of this toner on my skin. However at this price, i dont see how much difference this toner does compared to other toners that i could get for way cheaper price."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Good for my skin,"Creating a clear and clean complexion, remove excess oils and stubborn impurities whilst soothing and refreshing. I feel fresh after the using the toner. Good for my skin. "
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Glowy,I like its smell and it doesn't irritate my skin. I first tried the small one from the acne clear set and I've decided to buy the full size. Makes my skin look glowy everytime I use it. 
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,USA,No more breakouts! Holy grail product,"I've been using this for less than a week... I haven't had a single breakout after day 2 and now on day 5 my blackheads are even clearing up. Best of all, I didn't have any skin purging in the process, just disappearing acne. Amazing! I also got the ""O"" lotion (same thing almost but for your body) and thay did purge my skin before my back started clearing up... but even that only took 2 days. Great stuff and inexpensive too."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Decent enough,"It wasn’t anything amazing, but it did prep the skin well before I put on my skincare and make-up. Did not notice if it had broken me out or help with the acne I already had. "
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Too dry ,"I have acne skin. I thought this product will be suitable for oily, acne prone skin. But it made my skin dry and also caused my skin to breakout.  Maybe if you have very oily skin with serious acne problems, you can give this product a try. "
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,USA,amazing,This product combined with the acne cleanser has saved my skin! Have been suffering from hormonal acne for a year and nothing at all has helped like these two products combined. Yes I know it smells like alcohol but follow up with a good moisturizer and  you won’t dry out. Literally has saved my skin and cleared up my adult acne
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Decent,"I don't find it doing much for my breakouts but still a decent toner. My face feels squeaky clean after using it but still moisturizing and doesn't break me out. It has a pretty strong astringent smell but doesn't sting on my active pimples. Overall, not bad but not amazing."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Favourite toner ever! ,"Favourite toner ever! Have re-bought this over and over again. I use this after my daily washing of face. Makes my skin feels refreshed and clean after  every use. 

"
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Impressed ,"I have never been a huge fan of toners, but I find this very pleasant and soothing on my skin. It doesn't strip or irritate, and feels refreshing. My face has been healing very nicely since using this. Love!"
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Good product,"As a toner, it isn't too bad. I'd even say it does it's job. But I've also used many other similar toners that's cheaper, more value for money and with basic ingredients so I wouldn't repurchase this without promo or discount."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,USA,LOVE!,This is one of the ONLY products to ever work on my skin. I use it once or twice a day and it does not cause overdrying. It unclogged my pores within a couple uses. I also love how much you get and a little goes a long way.
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,USA,Mario Badescu Special Cucumber Lotion,"I have been buying bottles and bottles of this stuff for years! I take amazing care of my skin, but do have trouble with breakouts and this skincare staple has been my saving grace for adult acne. I use it before the avocado sleeping mask and that provides me with enough moisture that I don’t have any issues! Amazing!!!"
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,USA,alcohol,literally smells and feels like rubbing alcohol i don’t understand why they would even sell this is horrible for your skin anyways.
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,USA,If you don't want alcohol in your toner...hide.,"I do not like to waste products so I usually use an entire bottle before throwing it out whether I like it or not (unless it makes me breakout). I have been loving this product as a toner and it feels great on the skin and makes the skin feel very balanced . The smell is also amazing. I just recently discovered though that the second ingredient is alcohol, and alcohol is one of the worst things to have in a toner. I've always been told if your toner has alcohol to run and hide, so that is why I gave it 3 stars and why I won't be repurchasing. The 3 stars are for the scent, price/amount of product you get for the price, and the balancing effect. But again, I will not be repurchasing and my suggestion to you is to find a toner without alcohol."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,cooling,Helps my skin get better and get rid from acne and prone. Smells good and has cooling effect also reduce oil but not cause drying in my case. Great product 
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,great for acne,It doesn’t make my skin dry at all. Never skip using this after washing your face. It helps to absorb the oil from skin. It literally makes my skin feels fresh
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,soothing ,"Soothing and hydrates my skin. Love the cucumber extract. It calms my skin and does helps to prevent breakout, reduce redness as well. Will repurchase it."
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,FTW,this is very smooth on the face! i love it! no wonder i really love all mario badescu products. it really caters to your skin needs and provides the necessary solutions without breaking the bank
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Special cucumber lotion,First timer using this product. The smell is good. The texture is good as well. It does make my face skin free from dirt & oil. But as of today I see not much difference to my redness & acne. 
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,so so,To be honest quite a disappointment as I thought the brand Mario Badescu is meant for blemish skin however after I receive the product I read that there’s alcohol in the toner. I’m not saying alcohol is really bad for skin but it’s kinda tried out my skin tho.
MARIO BADESCU-Special Cucumber Lotion,,Refreshing,Not the best but it really works removing excess oil and dirt off my face and I even take it down my neck and chest because it feels cool and refreshing
SHISEIDO-WASO Beauty Smart Water,Singapore,a little greasy ,Had high expectations for this product as I like multi tasking skincare. But I always find it a little too greasy and oily on my skin and subsequent skincare don’t apply as well after. It still delivers what it says though.
SHISEIDO-WASO Beauty Smart Water,Canada,Shiseido WASO Beauty Smart Water,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I used this as a toner, and it was really nice just like other Shiseido toners."
SULWHASOO-Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Water EX,Singapore,best toner,"I am a Sulwhasoo addict and believer  since discovering the 5 and 10 step Korean skin care routine and follow this daily am and pm.
this toner is amazing slight more gel like and use it in combination with the first care serum and the followed by the ginseng serum and with the eye cream also ... love the effects it has on my skin! "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Clarifying Toner With 5% Niacinamide & Zinc,Singapore,A very important toner in skin care.,This toner is a very useful thing in facial skin care. Cleansing and moisturizing. Helps make skin smooth and nourished. The skin becomes clean and elastic. Not expensive and good brand.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Clarifying Toner With 5% Niacinamide & Zinc,Canada,Does the job,"I really like this product, it's helped the size of my pores and my blackheads and does not irritate me which happens quite a bit. For the price-point its an amazing option"

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Clarifying Toner With 5% Niacinamide & Zinc,Malaysia,new added into daily skincare routine,I could say its worth the penny bcz the amount is 200ml which last long for me around 5-6month use! Before this i used Clinique but i found it quite expensive and luckily i found this new toner from Sephora! So far i like it! My pores feel so clean! 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Clarifying Toner With 5% Niacinamide & Zinc,Singapore,Great product ,"The products from Sephora Collection are generally good especially this toner. it's a straight forward, no frill toner that does what it says. Value for money too"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Clarifying Toner With 5% Niacinamide & Zinc,Canada,Sephora Collection Clarifying Toner With 5% Niacinamide &amp; Zinc,"super great product, i noticed immediate results and it is so gentle perfect for everyday use. especially for the price i am very very impressed!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Clarifying Toner With 5% Niacinamide & Zinc,USA,Might work for oily skin types,The ingredients list was really great on this product however I found it to be more drying than just skipping toner and using a moisturizer. I think this product would work best on someone with an oily skin type. Personally I have a dry skin type and this product led to dryer feeling skin for me.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Clarifying Toner With 5% Niacinamide & Zinc,Canada,Sephora Collection Clarifying Toner With 5% Niacinamide &amp; Zinc,Have been using this for about a week and so far it's pretty good. Skin feels nice after and not dry or sticky. Was hoping for a little more oil control though.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Clarifying Toner With 5% Niacinamide & Zinc,Canada,Great Product,This toner does what exactly it says. If you’re new to niacinamide. This may sting for the first few days but your skin adjusts nicely to it. I saw visibly reduced pore size in less than 2 weeks.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Clarifying Toner With 5% Niacinamide & Zinc,USA,Sephora Collection Clarifying Toner With 5% Niacinamide &amp; Zinc,I use this toner at night after I clean my face . It leaves no residue nor does it feel sticky . It feels refreshing and has no smell which I love.  It has helped with my acne scaring and face looks much cleaner and bright .
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Clarifying Toner With 5% Niacinamide & Zinc,USA,Reduces the appearance of my pores,Awesome niacinamide toner!!  I love combining this on a cotton pad with Thayer’s alcohol-free toner and it makes my pores almost nonexistent!!  I’ve been using niacinamide regularly for a while now and it’s been great for my skin but I wanted to add it to my morning routine and this has worked out perfectly.  It’s gentle with 5% niacinamide and the relatively simple list of ingredients doesn’t conflict with anything I already have going.  The texture is lightweight and watery.  It sinks in quickly and really reduces the appearance of my pores.  Highly recommended.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,"My 1st bottle, and I'm already getting a bigger one. Love that refreshing & clean feel after applying this. I have yet to see in the dark spot area, but I'm already liking it. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,New Zealand,awesome product ,This product is amazing!! I have been using this for a few years for my acne scars. I’ve tried to use other products but always tend to go back to this one. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner - 190ml,"great to clear your texture, I have seen visible result within about 3 weeks but the key is to stick to it and use it every other day with a subtle moisturizer."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,amazing ,Its an amazing product to be honest. Been using sometime. Worked great and gentle on skin. Will definitely keep purchasing it. Holy grail for me! Amazing!!!!!!! Love it.                             Love.         
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,it's really good toner for pigmentation. ,"Cannot recommend it enough. It's amazing for dark spot, pigmentation and overall spot free face.I really enjoy this product. Made my skin spotless n glowing."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,Noticeable results!,Absolutely love this toner! Got onto it from a friend's recommendation and it has surpassed my expectations. Love it and will definitely purchase again once the bottle runs out. Vast improvement to age spots that my skin doctor said I wouldn't be able to lighten
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Canada,MUST HAVE for pigmentation!!!,I used this product back in 2019 when I was really struggling with acne scarring/pigmentation . I used one full bottle and I have included the pictures for before/after. The first picture is from January 21st 2019 and the second photo is from June 24th 2019
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,mandatory night routine ,"ole henriksen products never disappoints.. on my second bottles already, mainly use this at night cause it works well with other night-time product. definitely worth my money.."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Strong frangrance,"Feels good on my skin, but I do not see any visible improvements.  I will not buy again due to the smell - it's not bad, but a tad bit too strong for me, smells like a blend of vanilla and citrus."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,New Zealand,ole toner,I have been enjoying this product so far . have noticed a brightness to my fave since using it . very minimal change in pigmentation but I understand pigmentation is a long battle so will continue to use at night time 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,it’s a no ,"Left my skin really sticky and I found I broke out more with pimples from this, I actually don’t like the way it feels at all. I have other toners that don’t leave that sticky feeling "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,Gentle & Clean,"If you’ve got sensitive skin or are new to chemical exfoliants, this is the best starter product. Be sure to use it with a cotton pad for maximum effectiveness."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,New Zealand,My Go To!,I received this product as a sample and know part of my regular morning and nightly routine. I have definitely noticed results with this brand and product and is the only toner I use
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Great for dark spot,This works well for me. It cleared up my dark spots. Have purchased more than once now.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,Fresh and Fruity,An interesting toner. It smells fresh and fruity - an almost sweet smell to it. The consistency is watery and it is easy to apply as it glides on smoothly. Leaves skin slightly brighter in completion but can’t comment on any transformational dark spot changes. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,ba,"I love this Toner, it’s the best one so far.
It’s so light and gives a bit of a tingle feeling on the face and it also tightens the face at the same time, I purchase 2 more of the big bottles."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Canada,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner - 190ml,"I’ve been using this for over a year now and I love it! I noticed immediate results from using it, it cleared up and lightened a lot of my acne scars and uneven skin tone. It’s a little potent/strong and does sting a bit if you have any active acne."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,WHAT IN THE…,why did they make this in a smaller bottle? i used to receive a 10oz bottle and i reordered and didn't notice until i actually had it in my hand that it's nearly 4oz smaller but not any cheaper.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Overnight Results,"The next morning my skin was NOTICEABLY smoother and softer. This entire brand's products are extremely effective skincare staples you need to achieve hydrated, even toned skin"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,A MUST USE TONER,I have done using it almost 2 weeks now I can see that my dark spot has cleared and improve tremendously .Plus the smell is so pleasant with a grapes kind of smell is just makes my skin  feeling so fresh after using it. i’ve also used a couple of exfoliating toner before this but they make my skin irritated and breakout but this one really kind to Skin and make your skin really calm and relax
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,Ok toner,This toner was ok - I didn't notice a huge difference and I wouldn't repurchase. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,Great toner,"This is a great product it’s not strong and doesn’t sting at all except one day when i had a pimple. It’s so brightening, it was a noticeable difference. I don’t mind the smell of it either."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,awesome!,"Some exfoliating toner might feel tingling sensation, but one not. I feel soft after wash my face. Not yet see any changes to my post acne, hope to see it later."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,smells great ,"I’m not huge on toners as it is… they are great if you cbf or have a specific skin concern, otherwise it just seems like an extra step I don’t need. 
Perhaps more beneficial if you use a milky or oily based cleanser. I use a foamy cleanser (from Youth To The People) and I double cleanse, so my skin always feels super clean afterwards. I didn’t notice a huge difference in my skin, tbh? 
Smells great. The results just weren’t there for me personally. I wouldn’t repurchase this product. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Canada,Smells like a cheap tanning salon,"Strongly scented with coconut, and not the good kind, more like the cheap tanning salons I visited in high school. Minimal results on lightening my dark spots don’t make it worth buying again to put up with the scent."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Canada,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner - 190ml,love this product. skin feels very cleaned and gentel after using it.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Philippines,Definitely saw some improvements ,"Due to the use of a certain product, I recently developed some whiteheads on my forehead. I used this product shortly after, and the whiteheads were gone by the first week. 

Aside from that, I haven’t noticed any effect on actual old dark spots or other skin conditions just yet. 

One thing I hate though, is the fragrance/smell. It might not bother some people, but it’s too much for my tastes. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,New Zealand,Hmm..,"So I have dark spots and was recommended to buy this. If I’m giving my honest thoughts, it didn’t do much if anything at all, and I’m writing this after many months of using it. You’d expect something to work, pretty disappointed "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,Supergood,As for now this is the best skincare product for my sensitive skin. It helps to make acne dried. For dark spot lightening it takes sometime to dissappear. For me I don't mind of waiting atleast it does not damage my skin.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner - 190ml,Love the smell! Skin feels very cleansed after it. Next time going to buy full size.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Canada,Great for body acne,"Love this for body acne and scarring! I haven’t used this on my face because it feels like it would be too drying, but I do use it to combat body acne and the scarring that goes along with it and it works great!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,New Zealand,It is alright ,"I bought the smaller version of this product.
It feels alright. Nothing spectacular I have seen but I guess it is a small bottle so I won't see much difference and I am used to much stronger glycolic acid toners. This is good for people who want something very gentle.

The scent of this product is not terrible but it smells really bitter. I had to hold my breath while using it and therefore, the lower rating.
I am not opposed to scent but not when it is not a pleasant experience."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,stunning ,"Hands down the best toner I’ve tried in a long time. Helps with the dark spots and pigmentation I get on my cheeks and chin - especially dark spots from breakouts. Worth the price and lasts a longgggg time. 
Been using this for 3 years and you won’t catch me stopping any time soon. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,toner ,This toner did not really keep up with my expectations as I did not see much results. But the price is affordable. Perhaps can be used for everyday face routine. I would give 2 stars for this product. Maybe need to use other products alongside to see better results. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,my fav toner,"I am absolutely in love with this product, it helps to brighten my skin for flawless skin. It helps lighten my skin past scars from my mask acne. definitely a must have in your skincare routine."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,clear,Love this product! I have definitely noticed an improvement in my skin after using this product-my skin is smoother and clearer than it ever has.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Canada,very strong citrusy smell,"The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was a very strong smell of an off citrus, I was going to put it back in the box and return it just on the smell because I am very picky , but I gave it a try so happy I did, one of the best toners I have used left my face glowing so soft and hydrated no oils I cannot stop looking in the mirror after one use."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,satisfied,Great toner for dark spots and enlarged pores. Smells good too. Slight tingly feel on thinner skin like upper lips. Applying this only when i sleep. If used in the day would require to apply sunscreen more often
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,basic toner,"this toner doesn't go well with my slightly sensitive oily skin. been using it for more than 3 weeks despite the bearable stinging feel, but doesn't seem to light my dark spots at all. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,gentle but effective ,I definitely see a big difference in my skin and acne after few weeks of using it. It’s gentle enough to not dry out our skin too much but effective in killing those acne!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Canada,Amazing for dark lines,I was able to see difference in a week time with regular use . I had dark neck lines which started to get lighten
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner - 190ml,Loveeee this toner. Works wonders on my skin. I saw a difference within a week of use. I’ve been using this product for more than a year now
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,A must-have in your nightly skincare routine!,"I really like this toner, and I do recommend. It did exactly what I expected. I have oily/acne prone skin, with acne scars. This toner is non drying, it evened my skin tone, smoothed out my lines, and gave me an overall clean, fresh, bright skin tone. This is my choice for a nightly skin toner."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,LOVE IT,"Absolutely love it!!!!       

I first used it in their small gift set, 
 Now I got the full size!
             
            
            
      

                    
         "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,Can’t be without it!,"I bit the bullet & tried this after a recommendation from a friend. THIS is the holy grail of toners. It helps with dark spots, complexion, & breakouts. I pair this with the caudalie acne serum, & that combo is brilliant, especially if you’re oily & acne prone. For some it might get tingly on your face after application, but that settles pretty quick, & it works a charm. If you get problematic skin or scarring, this one is for you."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,it’s alright ,"This dark spot toner didn’t really do much but it’s alright and it’s an ordinary toner that you can include in your skincare routine. It is a bit too pricey for what it does, so I suggest you buy it on sale like I did otherwise it isn’t very worth it."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,go to night toner,"I was unsure about this, but so glad I took the plunge, Although I have skin that has zero sensitivity,  I was concerned about over use of chemical exfoliants,  using this  at night has helped with my maturing skin"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,dark spot toner ,I got one as a sample once and I had to buy the whole product because it really works. My darks spot have decrease and my skin looks way better than before 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Canada,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner - 190ml,A friend recommended this product to me as I have quite a bit of dark spots/hyperpigmentation  on my face. I love the smell of this toner and it feels cooling/refreshing on my skin. I've been using this product for quite awhile now (recently purchased my third bottle) and it has been slowly lessening the dark spots on my face! It does make my skin oily though. However this doesn't bother me too much as I use other products to help with the oilyness.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,If you’re here thinking about it…buy it!!!,Love it!!!! Can’t recommend Ole Henriksen enough. There is nothing I can say here that would make people believe how great this man’s products are. They just really are perfect. Started buying because it was “high end” for my price point at the time. I have tried more expensive brands and nothing works as well. I use this at night and it is so noticeable when I miss a night.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Wouldn't be without it!!,Love this company's products. This toner has helped tremendously with age spots and size of pores. It has also helped with acne scarring from when I was younger
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Worth every penny!!,Noticeable difference on my dark spots within the first week of using this toner day and night. Doesn’t dry out the face and doesn’t smell chemically.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner - 190ml,"I have been using this for about a month now and have seen a great improvement to the texture of my skin. It has also helped minimize the acne I have and reduced redness and inflammation on my face. For reference, I have oily, sensitive skin, and struggle with hormonal acne and this product has worked wonders! Will definitely continue to purchase and keep as part of my night care routine."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner - 190ml,Regular use of this toner helps in reducing my acne spots. I see the difference when I use it
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,An effective dark spot toner ,"I was in need of an exfoliating product and since I was looking for something other than a traditional physical exfoliant, I decided to try this instead. I have enjoyed using Ole Henriksen products in the past, so I'd thought I'd give this a go and I'm glad I did. Whilst my skin can be pretty reactive to certain products containing acids, I didn't have any adverse reaction to this toner, instead afterca few uses my skin felt really soft and smooth. After about two weeks, I noticed that the small dark patches that I have on the sides of my face has dramatically faded. I wasn't expecting much from this product but it has excedeed my expectation 💙"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Too Much Fragrance,"I haven't seen much difference in my skin after 2 weeks, but the fragrance is overwhelming. There has to be something that works as well but isn't so unpleasant to use."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Better For The Body,This didn’t do much for my face BUT I didn’t want to waste it and started using it on my body and it worked great. I scar and get hyperpigmentation from anything and this has worked really well as an added layer to clear my skin up (even added it to my foot care routine and they look phenomenal). I get better use of this at night after a shower and of course using SPF the following morning.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,Ok but ...,"It's ok, this one. But I think you can skip this if you wanna to minimize the steps in your night ritual. I am onto my third bottle, and I don't think I wanna continue. It stings a little, and when wiped on my cleansed face, you will still see how much cleaner my skin can get! "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,New Zealand,absolutely divine ,I love this product it feels so good and I feel like I can feel it toning. It has a fresh lemony scent.

OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,Dint really see the result,"Purchased it but dint see any results. Infact it left my skin with more acne.
 Definitely dint work for my skin. But worked for my sister. It did wonders to her skin…."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner - 190ml,This is nothing but water in a bottle! I did absolutely nothing for me I returned it.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Definitely try this Glow2OH Dark Spot Toner,"Recently, I started trying Olehenriksen products. This dark spot toner was one that I've tried and I'm noticing a difference on my face. I'm not seeing as much dark spots as I noticed before this product. I also love the nice sweet scent of this toner. It smells fresh which makes the entire experience much delightful."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,A go to!,"A repurchase after testing the Ole acids set pack. Really smooths the texture of my skin and since discovering the Ole acid toner and serum I don't dabble with harsh abrasive/walnut exfoliants. Introduce slowly as it may upset the skin if you got from 0 to 100 straight away, but once adjusted it's transformative!  can honestly tell when I've slacked off using it and it works wonders overnight!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,Sticky but works!,"A little bit stickier than I had hoped, but the bottle lasts forever, and I can already see the results after just a few weeks of using this toner. Works really well with the other products in the Ole Henriksen range. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner - 190ml,I was skeptical at first but did seem to light the sun spots I have on my cheekbones. Also cleared post acne spots sooner. Now a fixture in my routine.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Canada,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner - 190ml,I threw this out. It was totally a waste of money. It’s just scented water. Doesn’t do much basically.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Canada,Favourite skincare product ever!!,"This is seriously the best product I have ever used for my skin. I suffered from acne scarring very badly, and after a couple months of use, you can’t see the scarring at ALL. It worked to even out redness and uneven tones in my skin as well, and just overall makes my skin RADIANT! I have combination skin, and it doesn’t dry out or make my skin oily. Ill never stop recommending this product. The smell tops it all off. It smells amazing. Go buy it right now!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,Useless,This is quite useless AND it dries out my skin. Potentially good for people with oily skin? Opt for ANY other toner as this does nothing for the face. Maybe use for the body but at this price point - really needs to deliver more. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Canada,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner - 190ml,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Did not work at all, very disappointed. I used as recommended though. Also, I never found out what is the % of the glycolic acid. Waste of money, not happy."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,Great For Dark Spots ,I use this everyday and my dark spots are less when I use it. I’m bad because I do like to pick at my face so I constantly have spots but this helps balance that out and keep my face from being as bad as it was previously with terrible acne marks and dark spots. Definitely recommend it to everyone 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Highly recommend!,Works wonders day and night – even for men! Highly recommend.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Canada,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner - 190ml,"I loved this toner! Left my skin feeling clean, yet not dry. Can mildly sting acne spots. Been using for a few weeks now, have noticed my skin does appear less dark spots."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,Glow indeed,"I wanted a treatment toner to keep my complexion from dulling and I also noticed very light pigmentation forming on my right cheek (drivers side, more sun exposure) I use a vitamin C and B serums and Sunscreen during the day and retinol and other potions at night but I wanted something extra to fill in my toner gap lol. This feels amazing, smells amazing (yet subtle) and works with my other products to keep discolouration and texture down and smooth. I do have that “glow” after I’ve used it. Slight tingle on application if I have exfoliated but that’s a given. I will be repurchasing this product. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,Decent,I use this as night toner. Decent. Though it is not the best toner I’ve ever used but it is okay for the price range and maybe for new skincare beginners. Price wise is affordable. Don’t think this is good for super dry skin though. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,must have in skin care routine,"I have been using this for a couple of years and I love it. Within a few months I could see some of my dark spots start to fade, use it everyday for better and faster results. I have oily skin"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,A favourite,Love this toner! Have purchased it a few times now and my skin always appears clearer and brighter. Is refreshing to use at night and doesn't make me red.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner - 190ml,Didn’t work out for my face. But I started using it under my arms and my knees that are dark as an exfoliant
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,Try,Bought this product during Sephora Beauty Pass Sales period to try it out as I saw plenty of reviews exclaiming how awesome this product is. Pretty packaging too.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,Does not do much :(,"I have high expectation on this product. But even after using the toner till finish, my dark spot is still visible. This toner is nothing much than a toner. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,My new go to toner!!!!!,"this stuff is absolutely amazing !!!! 
if your thinking about trying it don't, just do it and get it !!!! I actually got a sample of this with my reward points the other week and noticed such a difference in my skin the following morning after just one use I had to order the full size bottle!!!... there's no going back to my previous tonning brand now Im hooked on ole henriksen"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,not sure..,"this serum smells quite herbal to me. i used it for a few weeks and it seemed fine, but recently there were times when it felt stinging on my face.  not sure why. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,Game changer ,I am on my 3rd bottle of this toner magic. I after about 1 week of using this I noticed significant change in the redness to my skin. Even if I have a break out now my pimple is not nearly as red. My skin colour has evened out significantly since using this toner making me turn to lighter coverage foundations because I don't need to cover the red anymore! 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,New Zealand,good,"don't really like I but maybe I didn't get to use it for long enough to see changes, I found it a but too strong for my skin, won't be repurchasing again as it was irritating and dried out my skin. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Meh.,Been using it consistently and it hasn’t made a difference when it comes to dark spots. I was expecting more/better results especially since I normally love the Olehenriksen products and they work for me. Would not repurchase but will finish it up.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,Just a hype,"I’m officially banning this brand and the entirety of its existence. It’s just a stupid hype promoted by all by the useless influencers. Gosh this product was way too harsh, and for the price, it didn’t offer much. Thank god I bought the smallest size.
"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,Seems to work,Slightly has faded dark spots gradually.Sometimes I get redness from it so I use it less
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Miracles do happen,"I was sadly the epitome of dark spots but after using this, I should be their spokesperson for their Dark Spot Toner miracle team! Get your confidence back with this toner. Results are quick and spots will fade! None of that glow that just masks your spots, this will even out your skin tone so you can restart with a clean canvas."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Canada,Changed the texture of my skin!!!!,This literally changed the texture of my dry flakey skin from the winter. Didn't burn my skin like other AHAs. I used it every other day. Made my skin feel smooth and glass like. Will buy over and over again!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,an okay toner!,It makes my skin soft after applying with a cotton pad but i find the smell a bit strong. it does nothing to my dark spots so i will just finish this bottle but will not repurchase.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,P,I basically reorder this product as soon as it’s about to finish! It has helped change my skin over the years! :)
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Australia,it’s meh,This toner is alright. I haven’t seen much of a difference to my skin tbh. I do alternate this with the dermalogica toner so I’m not sure if the mix is making it not work but it’s honestly a bit lack lustre 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Philippines,3 stars,"Okay product but had high expectations since I love ole henrikson products so much. Not something I would purchase again to be honest. It really didn’t do much for my combination skin.
"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,works instantly!,"This product works like magic. Ranging from small acne spots to several all over my face, deep or not, this stuff really works! I’ve noticed a difference after just a few nights that my spots were significantly lighter and your skin looks healthy and glowing! Highly recommend, definitely worth a try you won’t regret it!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Canada,LOVE OH,"I love the OH fleet of products and definitely notice the different in my skin! Highly recommend!!

At night I use the dark spot toner, glow cycle serum, wrinkle blur eye cream, and goodnight glow moisturizer!

In the morning I use the vitamin c gel moisturizer!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner - 190ml,I noticed it works more effectively if you let the product soak on your skin rather than swiping. took a long while to notice results and the results were very minimal. a lot of their products are heavily fragranced. fragrance is a known skin irritant. OLE is not known for having revolutionary products and they over do it with the marketing rather than focusing on formulations. nothing out of this world.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,New Zealand,"a Gem, must have","I actually would highly recommend this. Good product to use to get rid of your dark spots, works perfect on sensitive skin. This is my gem and the only I toner that helps to get rid of my pigmentation. I use this in winter and avoid going under direct sunlight when using this product! I had amazing results but consistency is a key for this. Thanks "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,New Zealand,Good feel,"I find this feels good on my face, but I’m not 100% sure that I have seen any changes to my dark spots. I like the smell and the fresh feeling from the toner. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,New Zealand,Great for the Body,"Too harsh for my face but has been great for my legs! I use it on the dark spots I get from grazing my knees etc. and also after I shave.
Might be good on the face for less sensitive skin. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner - 190ml,I like this for acne care only if the surface is flat and the pimple isn’t big at all. It’s a spot toner for sure. It takes a while to work but I ultimately got results by being consistent with this.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Patience + Consistency,"Does it work? Yes.  But it requires patience and consistency.  You really need to use this product consistently to see results.  I’m almost through nature bottle and in my experience, you don’t notice any results for a while and then all of a sudden it seems like you just wake up and notice a difference.  One of those that sneaks up on you kind of products.  Use nightly, not during the day.  And don’t forget AHAs in these type of products can make your skin temporarily more sensitive during sun exposure which mean you could also see dark spots occur.  This means, just be sure to use a daily sunscreen. Otherwise, every time you use this product and don’t use sunscreen the days after, you’ve just waisted your time and money."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,"I like how it feels, but I don’t care for heavily scented products. I don’t mind scented but this is very perfumed."

ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,I think this product is great but it’s a helper for moisturizing very nice and lightweight and not sticky. I would definitely consider buying it.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Ehh okay,I received this for free in exchange for my honest review. I am not impressed. I normally opt out for sample size items and this is smaller than my pinky. They want us to use it over an amount of time and review it but it’s probably big enough for 5 days of use if your lucky. Not very impressed.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Great lotion!,I really like this lotion. I received it for free for testing purposes. It helped remove impurities from my skin and calm redness. I will be purchasing a full size in the future!

I liked how smooth it felt when applying it. It does make your skin feel soft, but the moisturizing effect didn’t last all day for me. I had to use another moisturizer in addition to this."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Hydrating,*I received this sample product from influenster in exchange for my honest review* A little goes a long way with this product. So when I received a small sample sized I was a bit surprised it last me a couple weeks. I initially tried this in the morning after washing my face but I didn’t like how sticky it made my skin feel. I switched to using it in the evening and when I woke up the next morning my skin felt hydrated and soft. This product does have a floral fragrance and if using a lot can be overwhelming but a small amount was tolerable for me. I would definitely use during the winter months when my skin tends to be drier.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Lightweight,"I have been experiencing a lot of dry skin lately But do not like the feel of heavy greasy lotions. This product is night because it was very lightweight with subtle hydration without being heavy. It could feel slightly sticky sometimes, but wasn’t really was touching it. Was more Dewy. I prefered to use it at night."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Solid Product!,"I would like to have received a larger sample in order to see everything this product can do. I preferred to use this at night, as it was a bit sticky on my face. It soaked in and made my skin feel extremely soft. I wasn't a big fan of the scent. It was a bit too florally for me. Overall, I give it a 3, with the possibility of a 4."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Subtle Hydration,"I was expecting more hydration power from this product. Once applied, it provides instant hydration but once the product dries…I didn’t feel hydrated or plumped."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Hydrating!,"I liked this product I found it to be hydrating, easy to use and aesthetically pleasing in its packaging. I’m interested in seeing how it’ll hold in the late fall and winter months that’s when my skin would be the driest."

ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Nice,This product is very different than your traditional lotion. Smells nice but very heavily scented. Leaves a sticky feeling after applying. This is a product I would use but not as my everyday moisturizer.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,"I received a sample size of the product to try for free, courtesy of Influenster, in exchange for my honest review.

Due to the size, I wasn’t able to try it too much. I really wanted to love it, but the couple times I used it, my skin just said “no”. That said, please take my review with a grain of salt because I am prone to rosacea and super super sensitive so it’s hard to find products that don’t irritate my skin."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Left my skin soft,I received a sample from Influenster for my honest review of this product. The sample I received was extremely tiny. It did have a soft pleasant scent and it felt a little heavy in the skin at first but soaked in fairly quickly leaving my skin very soft. I would have liked to have tried it longer then a week to see the full benefits though. I will probably purchase a full size to try long term.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Great for everyday use,I was able to get a few good uses out of the sample size I received. It’s very hydrating and keeps my dry skin soothed. Has little to no scent and no irritation. Perfect for everyday use
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Decent,Wish I had a bigger sample. Did what’s it’s supposed to but I’ll stick to my other stuff ether results. Is a decent product though.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,OK,"This product was nice, it was definitely hydrating. But I don't think it's something that is crazy and you need to have, there's a lot of other products that probably do the same thing I am OK with just using my Ordinary serum. The smell is also very strong and I was not a fan of that."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,"I have extremely dry skin, and I loved the soft clean infusion! I used it as part of my bedtime routine, and it left my skins feeling soft and supple when I woke up! I would highly recommend this to anyone battling dry skin! The only side is that is it quite pricey."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,As far as I can tell…,"It works well. It hydrates and looks nice, but is heavily scented. I can’t speak on the long term effects, as I only received a small sample and am not sure that I will purchase. I received my sample from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for a review."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Good lotion,I received a free trial product. My skin is oily on T zone but dry around my nose. This product left my skin feeling soft and refreshed. I would buy.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,It’s okay. For oiler skin,"This lotion isn’t very indicative of a lotion in consistency. Reminds me more of micellar water. It does however make your skin feel very soft. It does not last long though and needs a more heavy duty moisturizer to do the job. Overall I think this is a good option if you need some moisture for oiler skin, if you’re very dry I wouldn’t recommend since you will need another moisturizer to go with it."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Try it!,I really enjoyed this essence lotion. It was very Hydrating and left my skin feeling smooth and silky.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Smoothing but sticky!,"This is really nice. I have super oily skin so this was the perfect amount of hydration for me, and it did last me a long time cause I didn’t have to use so much. Smells really nice but super sticky, felt like I needed a fan sometimes to dry it down."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,I liked it!,I received this product complimentary for my honest review. This was a nice product that made my combo skin feel nice and smooth as a part of my skin care routine without breaking it out.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Sample too small to tell,"I received this in exchange for a review. Unfortunately, I can’t tell if it’s a winner or not because the sample was so small. I think it was supposed to be for a week, but it barely lasted that long. The toner smells great and did make my skin feel soft, but it wasn’t very moisturizing enough. And again, I didn’t use it enough to see a difference.  Maybe for someone with oily skin it would be better"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Not worth the cost,"I think it was alright, it didn’t irritate my skin or anything but I didn’t really see any real benefits from using. Very strongly scented. I received a sample through Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,I think I've used every skin product out there in hopes of getting an even skin tone without drying out my face and then with nothing to loose decided to try this amazing brand and it was a game changer!

ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Hydrated well,"I received this product for free, for my honest opinion. 
I have sensitive/oily skin and I tried a small amount on my hand first. A little goes a long way, it is kinda sticky when applying but it does hydrate the skin."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,This moisturizer goes on very light but is surprisingly moisturizing. It made my skin feel very soft. My only downside is that it does have a bit of tackiness to it while it’s absorbing.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Goes on very light!,"I received a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. I have a combination skin type, so it’s important to me that my facial lotion can help me balance the dry and oily parts. I love the light, velvety texture of this facial lotion. It goes on extremely smoothly and light that I can’t feel it on my skin at all. It has helped my dry areas stay hydrated without increasing the oiliness of the other  parts of my face."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,A nice toner,I received this complimentary product in exchange for my honest review. I have combination skin and this worked nicely to cleanse and moisturize my skin before I apply other facial products.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Refreshed and moisturized,The sample was soo tiny I wasn’t able to get a consistent feel on the results. From what I did gather it left my face moisturized and feeling refreshed however I did not have enough of the sample to see if the results are consistent.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Moisturizing,Extremely moisturizing. Although it really could do without the fragrance. I have sensitive skin and thought it might break me out or dry my skin out but it leaves your skin feeling supple and soft.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Not for me/too much fragrance,"I received a free sample of this new item from Estée Lauder and Influenster. I have rosacea that flares on top of having combination skin. This product has a floral smell and it’s heavily scented - I’m not a fan of heavy scents in skincare, I am particularly not a fan of florals. I assume the floral extracts and the additional fragrance added in are why my skin was irritated by this particular item. It may be perfect for folks without fragrance sensitivities etc."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Can't wait to add it to my routine!,"I received this product complimentary from Estee Lauder and Influenster for my honest review. I received a .24oz sample so I must say I didn't use it very long, but a little goes a long way, so I achieved twice a day for about a week. I have combination skin, and I regularly use toner in my skincare regimen, and I must say this essence is on my list to fully try! It is lightweight, soaks right into your skin, and they aren't lying about the hydration, you can feel it immediately. The way the texture of my skin started to change I truly believe with the proper time the results they are aiming for will be achieved."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Glowy Skin,"I received this product as an exchange of my honest review.

The sample was enough for me to try once so I can't tell u the long term effect. The toner did absorb quickly with no residue of it existing.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Does what it says!,"This does leave my skin soft and hydrated! It sinks in quickly and doesn't leave a weird film. It definitely does exactly what it says and does it well. It only hydrates and does not contain any anti-aging, pore refining, etc.... agents. Just keep that in mind.

I received this product complimentary,"

I was not a fan of this product. It was heavily scented and irritated my skin. I didn’t notice any hydrating benefits after using it completely up for 2 weeks. I just couldn’t get past the floral scent, it made my skin itchy and red. After a while that sensation went away but I just did not like it. It also felt sticky on my skin as well. I don’t have sensitive skin so I’m not sure why this irritated my skin."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,"This is a good product if you want that luxurious skin care routine experience. It makes the skin feel soft and smooth. A little goes a long way with this thick essence. It's very spreadable and non-sticky. It has a strong fragrance scent, which I thought would be irritating but it didn’t affect my skin or the softness of it while using it, it might affect people with much more sensitive skin though. It produces no real change in the long term, it hydrates while it's on the skin surface, making it plump for a bit, but after that it goes back to its usual state."

I feel like my skin has started looking bette since using this. It’s a really thin formula and not sticky at all, it feels really nice on the skin.

It is very lightweight and very smooth I would say for the couple of days that I did use it it worked well.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Very Moisturizing,"My dry skin really loves this! This was less a lotion, and more a liquid, but my skin loved it. It's super hydrating and absorbs quickly. It left my skin feeling smooth and softer to the touch. I think the scent is a bit too strong, but it was pleasant. I definitely see this added to my routine, especially during the winter months. My dry patches are gone when using this treatment."

This toner was just okay to me. Its most noticeable feature is the fragrance, while not overpowering it is still strong and is floral/soapy. The texture is watery, not too thick. I felt it absorbed quickly but also left some sort of tackiness or soapy feel on my skin. The packaging states that it is recommended for dry skin, but I would recommend other hydrating/milky toners over this one instead."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Baby soft skin,"I received a complimentary sample of this from Influenster and Estée Lauder. I really loved this product. The first time I used it, I had a slight reaction to it. After that, it worked great. My skin felt baby soft, and my skin looks hydrated. Love it!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Amazing,"I received this product for free to review, I’m so shocked at how well it worked. It truly revitalized my skin and left it feeling so soft. I loved how just a little bit of it went a long way. Definitely adding it to my list of skin care products!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,I really loved how soft and refreshed my skin felt after using it. The only reason I didn’t give it five stars it’s because scent was very strong.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Good!,I received this in a very small sample. However after using it I did start to like it as part of my routine. It is very hydrating and feels like a lotion but is liquid. This lasted longer than I anticipated which is great. I feel like even buying the bigger size can last a long while which is great! It felt hydrating on the face and wasn’t sticky which is my favorite part.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Adding to my daily routine,"After using this product over the past few
weeks, I am loving the results! It has helped keep my dry
skin feeling hydrated. Application is easy, and the formula is amazing."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,For Combination or Dry Skin Types,"Interesting. Seemed like a lotion and toner all in one bottle. Just a little bit of product when applying, can go a long way. The bottle can last awhile which makes it economical. No greasy film or residue was left on my face after serum dried. Recommend."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,"This was just an okay product for me - it has a very strong rose fragrance, you know, that old school luxury skincare scent. I wish it was either fragrance free or just had a less noticeable scent. I don’t think it was not hydrating enough although I do have oily skin so I don’t normally need much hydration anyway. Noticed no difference and will not purchase myself. Gifted in exchange for a review"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Feels nice on my skin,This goes on very smoothly and easily absorbs into the skin and dries quickly. It was a little irritating if I got it too close to my eyes when applying. It did give my skin a nice hydrated glow. I received a free sample from Estée Lauder & Influenster.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Wish it was cleaner,"I love the idea of this product, but I’m disappointed with it’s “clean” rating. I think I would be more apt to use their products if their was a fragrance-free option."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,I wouldn’t say this any impressive amount of hydration. The consistency threw me off. It has a strong “clean” scent that reminds me more of a cleanser. I don’t think I’d purchase the full size.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Good toner,"I received a sample size of this product for free from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review. This essence is hydrating, feels very good on your skin, feels like a serum but it is very fluid. I like to apply it before my night cream. I like it."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,"I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This product had a light, non cloying smell and it left me soft and smooth. I never felt greasy or broke out."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Good toner.,This is a good toner. It has a nice scent and it leaves my skin feeling soft. It is a bit expensive compared to comparable toners on the market and I don’t feel that it was special enough to justify the price. It’s good but it isn’t life altering.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,"I received this complimentary. I found that this product did moisturize my skin, but not nearly as much as less expensive similar products I use regularly. I also prefer unscented products, and this has a very strong scent."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Refreshing,My skin feels very refreshed and hydrated after using this. I got this product for free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. My skin feels fantastic.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Okay but prefer cleaner ingredients,"I am 40 and have dry skin. I do not like the heavy Fragrance (Parfum) in this, especially for my dry skin type. The scent has a sort of rose fragrance to it, definitely floral and artificial. Although it is free of other ingredients I avoid in my skincare, I can’t recommend this for long term use without having cleaner ingredients based on my personal preferences regarding fragrance ingredients, but it does have some immediate benefits. Absorbs nicely into the skin and drys down quickly without feeling sticky. After applying, my skin immediately feels silky soft and looks smoother. My sample was so small though I did not see any long-term benefits."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Soft skin that smells good,"I received a sample of this product from Influenster in the Estée Lauder voxbox in exchange for an honest review. 

The sample I received was rather small, and generally I like to test a skincare product for at least a month before I’m confident I’ve experienced the results I can come to expect with it. However, on initial trial, the product smells really nice. Normally, I’m not one for fragranced skincare products because I just feel that it’s unnecessary and can lead to breakouts. But the scent was really subtle. It was almost kind of floral and delicate. 

When applying to my face, it was thicker than i assumed it would be. It was almost like the consistency of a snail mucin. Even on the first trial, it did make my skin feel really soft. 

As for any other results, I was only able to get about four uses from the sample bottle before it ran out, so I didn’t notice any significant changes to my skin. 

It did not break me out, and it didn’t make my skin feel oily. Even though it had a heavier consistency, it didn’t feel heavy on my skin, and played nicely with all of my other skincare products. 

I would be willing to try this product again. I do wish that I would have gotten a little bigger of a sample to be able to assess it’s more long term results, but i did get a good first impression from this product."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,My skin did feel softer after using however it made me quite greasy after awhile. I also wasn’t a big fan of the scent and thought it was a bit strong.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Juicy skin,So hydrating! Love this product i like the clean smell it has and that it adds softness to my semi textured skin. Super love this product and i recommend !
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,I love how soft this made my skin feel. It was super hydrating. Will definitely have to try this again.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Hydrating,I recieved a sample of this complimentary for my honest review.  Being that it was a sample I was able to get about 14 days out of the bottle.  A little product goes a long way.  It is hydrating and absorbs without leaving my skin sticky.  I would consider purchasing this for the harsh winter months.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Love!,Loved! I incorporated this product into my nightly routine. This has left my dry skin glowy and hydrated. I received this product free for testing
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Would have to try more to be accurate,I’m sure it’s great I didn’t really get to try it so I have no clue how good it is in the long run
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Great product!,This isn't a product I would normally reach for but I liked it more than I thought I would. It's hydrating without being heavy. I definitely think it would be good for someone with oil probe skin as it's not oily. I also like the light clean slightly soap-like smell. I think this product is a pretty good price as well.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,This is great for dry skin. It is hydrating and is easy to apply. The consistency is nice and it soaks right into your skin. It is great that it is free of a lot of chemicals you do not want your skin absorbing but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because it does still contain some bad ingredients such as fragrance. I received this product complimentary to try out.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,I got a sample of this to review for free. I honestly don't see any difference between using this product and not. I can see how this might be nice for very dry skin or as an extra step in a winter skincare routine. I just don't feel like this is a necessary product to incorporate in my current skincare routine.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Just ok,I didn’t really understand the point of this product. I received a tiny sample so maybe I didn’t get the full affect. I did not like that it had fragrance. I probably wouldn’t purchase in stores.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Feels Nice,I received a complimentary sample from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This made my face feel nice and soft. I think it would be great for someone with dry skin or in the winter months when cold weather dries skin out more. It is thick and goes on well.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Nice scent but tiny sample,I received a complimentary sample of this Hydrating Treatment from Influenster. Sadly the sample is so tiny it's hard to really give this product an efficient test and determine just how well it works over time. It has a nice rose scent and did leave my skin feeling hydrated. Would have loved to atleast given the product atleast 2 weeks of use to truly see the results.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Lovely Hydration,"I received this sample product from influencer & Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review.  The Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Treatment Lotion has great essence. It really refreshed my skin after my face wash routine. I have Combination skin & thankfully there was no oil build up, which sadly happens quite often with certain products. It gave a good moisturizer to my dry skin areas.  The light rose scent isn’t overwhelming. I found the texture a little thicker, but it doesn’t feel that way when applied to my skin & it was absorbed quickly. I would try again & recommend."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Just fine,I received a sample size from Estée Lauder and Influenster in exchange for an honest review. It has a delicate rose scent and I like it. I put this after I wash my face. I may like the softness of my skin after I applied it but it wasn’t enough. As long as I don’t have any pimple pop up that means I can use this product. I would recommend this to anybody to give it a try.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Not my favorite,I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I wasn’t really a fan. It felt heavy on my skin. I think if you have very dry skin it may work for you. I also wasn’t a huge fan of the scent but I’m sure plenty of people would be. I have combo skin and occasionally have acne so I don’t think it’s the right product for my skin
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Nice!,"I received this as a small sample so unfortunately I couldn’t use it for a long time to be able to see results.  Ion the short amount of time I used it though, it felt incredible on my skin, it feels like smooth, soft water on my dry dehydrated skin with a delicious scent."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Just ok,"I received a sample from Influenster and Estée Lauder to review in exchange for my honest opinion. I unfortunately didn’t love this lotion. I have dry and acne-prone, sensitive skin so I tend to steer clear of scented products. While the rose scent is pleasant, I do feel it was a bit heavy. After using this product for a week I did feel my skin was soft, but I did not see much of difference from using the product. I didn’t see a glowy effect as others have stated they experienced. I can appreciate the consistency of the product. It applied easily with my finger tips and a little product goes a long way. Sadly I don’t think it’s a necessary product to add to my skincare routine."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Light and Refreshing!,"I was wonderfully surprised by this treatment lotion! The scent is amazing, especially right before you start or end your day. 

After cleansing, I would place a few drops in my hands then I would gently pat and massage my face while my face was still damp. 

This formula has a middle viscosity so it isn’t too thick or sticky. After application, your skin will feel nice and hydrated. 

This product is perfect for makeup prep!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Soft clean,"This is the first time that I like a soft clean. Smells so good , has good soft consistency took all the dirty in my skin. I recommend it."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,"Received free to review through Influenster. Liked the moisturizer enough, but felt it could soak into my skin more. It is so thin it is hard to apply carefully. Didn’t love the smell."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Just ok essence,"This essence was just ok. I tried this essence for about a month and found no difference in my skin. I do have dry to normal skin especially living in LOs Angeles, so I can take all the hydration I can get. But I didn’t feel like this product made much of a difference to my skin.

For those reasons, I wouldn’t recommend for those with really dry skin !"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Love the product on my skin,"After using the product, I could feel that my dry skin is finally getting the glow and hydration I would like it to have. Scent is a plus. I like to apply this on top of a light toner and then a light moisturizer as my skin is extremely dry."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,"Okay, not great",Overall decent but didn’t provide a long term or super noticeable difference.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Softer Skin,"*I received this sample complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion*

Due to the extraordinarily small sample size, I was not able to trial this product for the usual new product/see results 3 week window. With that in mind:

My skin did feel softer immediately after applying. I had no problem with subsequent products being absorbed. I didn’t see any noticeable increase of glowy-ness at the end of my skincare routine.

The noticeable downside for me if the very strong, and in my opinion juvenile, scent of the product. It reminds me of some sort of baby product, and is not at all suited to an adult, or sophisticated individual."
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,Very moisturizing,I received the Estée Lauder Soft Clean Infusion free from @influenster and loved the moisturizing effects it had on my skin. The Amino Acid15 Complex and Waterlily Flower Extract really helped pull in moisture to my dry skin. It was soft and subtle under my other moisturizers. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good base to their skincare. #freetome #influenster
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Infusion Hydrating Essence Lotion with Amino Acid + Waterlily,USA,SOFT,"I use this like a toner. As the name says “hydrating treatment lotion” so as expected - the consistency of it is thicker than like a liquid toner. The smell is amazing, smells rosey which I like a lot. I think overall this is a nice toner, I do like the texture and it definitely leaves my face feeling soft, and overall more hydrated than it began."
SHISEIDO-Revitalizing Treatment Softener Lotion,Australia,Ng,Very moisturising base before serum and heavier cream.
SHISEIDO-Revitalizing Treatment Softener Lotion,Canada,amazing softener for sensitive skin!,Amazing! I started Using this product once a day at night and within 5 days could see visibly smother skin and my texture was completely gone! My skin feels so smooth and so hydrated. I am a combo poly skin type and this has already worked wonders! I would highly recommend this for anyone looking to smooth and brighten their overall complexion!
SHISEIDO-Revitalizing Treatment Softener Lotion,Singapore,Love this!,"Currently on my second bottle, I noticed that my face is more hydrated and looks clearer. This becomes my daily day and night ritual now. Using this with Shiseido’s White Lucent Micro spot illuminating serum, I think this powerful duo has helped to lighten my dark spots and makes my skin look more radiant.
"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Canada,Disappointed,"I am a die hard Tatcha fan and I was excited to try this product as I already use the deep cleanse, deep rice polish, water cream, peony eye cream and the silk cloth. Unfortunately the texture tonic caused me to break out more than I every have in my life - including my teen years. Although I know skin can take some time to adjust to a new product, considering it took 5 days for my skin to clear up, I didn't want to take the chance."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"Over drying on my oily skin and made it worse.
Also very sensitive skin as well I don’t recommend. I wanted to love this."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,amazing,"I’m on my second bottle.  It didn’t take long to see a difference in skin texture.  My skin is smooth, pores are barely visible.  I love this stuff.  I use it morning and night."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Returned,I returned this. Caused redness and sensitivity on my normally not sensitive skin. It could be user error as not quite sure where it goes in my routine.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,"Overrated, overpriced",I'm not sure what the hype is over this product. This toner did NOTHING for my pores and I've been using it for months. Definitely NOT worth the $$$ tag.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Caused Red Bumps and Oiliness,"This is my first time writing a review, and I usually don’t write them, but I felt I should for this product because it was really hyped for me and I was told it was basically the best toner for my skin. The product did feel nice on my skin, but I quickly stopped using it after noticing it had caused some small red bumps to appear on my skin, which has never happened to me before, as well as making my face extremely oily, which was strange because my skin is usually dry or normal. I will be returning this because it did not work for me."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Malaysia,Great for oily textured skin,"I bought this for my husband with oily skin who has textured skin. After one week of using it in his AM routine, he claims that his face which normally turns into a greaseball by noon stayed relatively shine-free until late evening. I have also noticed that his face has a nice glow in the morning too!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Love this so much!,Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smooth.  I love that it doesn’t burn at all like most toners do (I have really sensitive skin).
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Singapore,Good product!,"I love this product! It applies well, and I really enjoy including it in my skincare routine! Highly recommended! :) "
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Highly Recommend!,"I was skeptical about buying this product. There are so many aha/bha liquids that you can choose from. Honestly, the price is worth the product! I noticed a drastic change in my skin texture after adding this into my routine. I have never had a completely smooth face until I started using this!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Singapore,Tatcha Texture Tonic,The tonic is soo good that it removes all e impurities/dirt on my face. Highly recommended for those with oily skin/combi. It does not clogs my pores at all!! 
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Canada,worth the price!,The amazing reviews are no joke! Within days my skin has visibly changed. Much more radiant and soft. Fine lines are softening and old breakouts are clearing/ marks fading.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Surprised at the speed!,"About 7 days in and THERE IS A DIFFERENCE! I’ve always struggled with texture on my forehead since I was 14 (20 years now) but as I got older and out of the acne phase, it’s just been moderately textured skin. Always showed under my makeup, etc. After reading reviews and hearing about this product, I decided to buy and I am so glad I did. Can’t believe there’s already a difference, and everywhere on my face that isn’t textured is nice and glowy."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Amazing Product for Oily Skin,"The Tatcha Water Cream has been my holy grail for awhile and thought I would try this. I have tried so many other skincare products to help my uneven texture, clogged pores, and oily skin and this is the best! My face looked and felt so clean after using this treatment, without feeling dried out. My face wasn't shiny at all for the entire day after using, which never happens for my oily skin. I followed the suggested Tatcha routine and it made my skin look better than it ever has. This is replacing Paula's Choice exfoliating liquid for me, which tells you that it's good. I'm obsessed!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"It’s only been a week of using this and I’m seeing changes in my skin! It looks more smooth, my face is less oily and my acne scars are slowly disappearing! This is a holy grail for my acne prone skin!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"Love, love, LOVE this product. I have been dealing with hormonal acne and someone suggested I try the Tatcha products. This as well other Tatcha products have definitely helped my skin and I have not had any breakouts. Was a little pricey, but definitely worth it!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,try this Tonic it’s absolutely fabulous.,I use 99% Tatcha products for my skincare regimen. I was just thrilled to get this Texture Tonic. It has closed my pores completely. I will never be without this product ever again!!! It’s my new go to skincare product. If you have any issues with large pores you have to try this. I’ve only been using this for about 2 1/2 weeks. But the change in my pores size is very noticeable. I highly recommend this tonic.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Singapore,Holy grail. ,"I have been eyeing this product for a looooooonnnnggg time and finally decided to get it. Omg, it could be anymore timely. It really helped to reset my skin texture and calm down my breakouts. It doesn’t sting even tho there are AHAs. I have been using this in the evening together with the Tatcha Essence and both are a great combination. Overall a great product worth investing in. "
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,I BELIEVE WHAT IT ADVERTISED,"I was very skeptical buying this because of the price range. Since there’s no mini version I just have to trust it. I love this. After one week the texture on my skin decreased by … a lot lol. I don’t have acne prone skin so I’m not sure how it would affect others who do have it. But it almost has a natural blurring effect on my skin. Once I get the coloring right on my skin and combine it with this, I might not need foundation anymore. Love love it."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,HOLY GRAIL!!,"Holy grail!! I love this toner. My face looks so much better, is much smoother, and the blackheads on my nose are gradually fading. I will never stop buying this omgg"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Singapore,Texture Tonic,Thumbs up! Tonic have a fermented smell. Hydrating for skin. Pricey.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Amazing! (Oily and fair skin.),"This toner is fantastic and does exactly what it says it does. I have fair skin that gets red very easily, toners have never been tolerated by my skin because of this. But this toner, this toner is amazing. It doesn’t make my sensitive skin red and actually helps keep my oily T zone under control. I highly recommend giving it a try."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,not for dry skin,"I am so torn on this product! It works AMAZING for texture! After just two nights of using this, my skin is the SOFTEST it’s ever been my whole adult life. My redness significantly decreased. I didn’t notice any difference with my pores. My issue with this product is that it’s not good for dry skin. My skin felt very tight after application and the next morning I woke up with extremely oily and greasy skin because this stripped my already dry skin. I am really torn on returning this or keeping it and just using it less. It REALLY works for texture but dry skin babes, proceed with caution. Maybe get a sample first before committing to the full size bottle. I definitely recommend this to the oily skin people out there with texture problems."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,A keeper!,"This tonic is great.  I find it clears pores, and since starting this, my skin is smoother and more balanced.  I will be keeping this in my routine."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Not worth it,"I bought this based on reviews but then I noticed later all the great reviews were from people who got this for free. Not saying everyone isn’t being truthful however, this stuff made the texture of my skin worse and gave me weird bumps all over my face. It’s definitely getting returned especially for the price."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Amazinggg,"The difference in my skin is undeniable! I usually use the Dr. Gross two step peel, but this has me SOLD. it’s easier, less time consuming and just as effective."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Amazing Tonic,This tonic is awesome! I have been consistently using it at least once per day for the past two weeks. My skin is smoother with less texture. I wish it came in a smaller size for traveling.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Best toner for dry acne skin,"I rarely put on reviews but I have to for this Tatcha Toner. I brought this when I was in Hawaii. I had heavy acne and blemish issue. I’m 21, gay man, had super dry skin. I use this on a daily basis and it works miraculously. Definitely repurchase!!!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,"Super refreshing, skin clearing!",This is incredibly refreshing on the skin and feels very clarifying without being harsh. Love it! My skin also looks brighter and feels softer after regular use.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Amazing! Helped my redness and surface acne,"I am an avid Tatcha user but I hadn’t tried their liquid treatment formulas yet. My cheeks have been experiencing flakiness, dullness, irritation, redness and surface acne from the coke weather and mask wearing. I decided to give this exfoliating treatment and try and within three days of using this morning and night my cheeks are already less flaky and my surface acne and redness is almost completely gone! Love this product I think it’s extremely effective yet gentle. It’s a little tingly at first on the skin but not irritating and the smell is different than normal Tatcha smells but I would say it smell is energizing and fresh."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,Love this on my skin. Does not irritate. Good for combination skin. Pricey. I wish it was more affordable.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,BUY THIS NOW!,"I rarely write reviews on skincare because of how subjective it can be, but this product is seriously amazing. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now, about 4 times a week and I have never had a product that made such an impact on my skin. I have seen the biggest improvements in my overall skin texture and tone. I was using an exfoliating toner before this that I thought worked fine but this overtakes it, no questions about it. I know the price is quite hefty but I promise you it's worth it. The only negative I have to say about this product is the smell is a little strong.  Other than that I will be buying this again when it runs out."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,WOW!!!,"This stuff is absolutely AMAZING!!! I’ve only been using this six days, but OMG I’m blown away. I experienced results after using it only once. My face has NEVER been as smooth as it is now, and my pores have literally disappeared. I didn’t expect this product to work (I’ve never used anything like this before), but it’s a miracle worker!!! And it’s totally worth the price!!! I hope they never stop making this product…I’m def going to be a user for life!!!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Results for days!,"I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review.

My skin is kind of sensitive and love that texture tonic is so gentle yet shows amazing results!

I used it for 3 weeks before writing this review to allow my skin time to take in the product but I literally saw results in like 2 days. This product isn’t like any other exfoliator I’ve used. Its very light on the skin and doesn’t dry the skin out. My skin is visibly firmer and pores are small. Definitely recommend this product!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha Tonic,"Hands down best toner I’ve used and always so excited to for my skincare routine when I jump out of bed. Immediate first impression: smells great and soothes my skin. For the few weeks I’ve used it, I’ve noticed my skin texture improve and some redness disappear. However, since I have really sensitive skin, I can only use it a couple times a week or every other day since it is an “exfoliating treatment”. I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,"Smoother, more even, less hyperpigmentation","#SephoraPartner
 I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review & today i’m talking about the one I selected to test. I chose to review @tatcha the texture tonic Aha liquid exfoliating treatment. I’ve been using this tonic since mid January & I’ve been looking forward to sharing my honest opinions. While I used a gift card to purchase this tonic, these are my honest opinions. 

Details: This tonic is a liquid exfoliator formulated  with fruit AHAs niacinamide, Japanese mugwort & wild rose. Designed to event both texture & skin tone as well as calm & leave your skin smooth. Recommended for combination or oily skin. Liquid exfoliation is gentle & removes dead skin cells to help with congested pores. In addition to the above, the tonic has the scent of the  sweet fennel & rosemary oil to minimize excess sebum & oil creation while it boosts your mood. This is a cruelty-free product 

My experience: For reference, I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin with some redness & sensitivity. This is a yellow, watery tonic that removes dead skin cells, oil, & dirt as well as unclogs pores. It has a lovely scent that isn’t too strong. I’ve been using this since 1/17 & my sensitive skin hasn’t experienced any irritation. I do take care not to use it when I’m using retinol. My skin is more even & smooth with a healthy glow. This doesn’t dry out my skin luckily nor does it leave a sticky/oily residue. I also notice it helps with oil reduction. you can see lightening of my hyperpigmentation (not including the random breakout). 

 Overall: I am LOVING the results I’m seeing so far from my use of this Tatcha tonic. My skin is smoother, more even & with less oil. It doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin or leave my skin dry or oily. This retails for $59 which is steep. Keep in mind it will last a long time & works well. 4/5

TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I was currently looking into trying out a new toner and so I decided to give this a try. I have been using this toner now for about three weeks and definitely see great improvement overall. It’s lightweight and has a refreshing scent. After using it for a week my pores appeared smaller and cleared out some redness. I have used a few other products to help with my oily skin and this toner seems to have done the best so far. I also have very sensitive skin so trying new products are always a risk but I am glad I went for it. It does nothing but make my skin feel amazing! This is my first time trying out a product from this brand and I am very impressed and looking into getting the moisturizing cream to go with it.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Great Add To My Everyday Skin Routine.,"“I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review“ 

I was looking for a toner to help keep my skin balanced and have some added benefits and this did just that! I love the formula, the smell isn’t overbearing and this product is straight to the point and does exactly what it’s suppose to do. My skin is pretty normal and I do experience many breakouts so the added AHA very bumped up my skincare game."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Canada,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"So amazing! Visibly helped with the texture on my skin as well as acne and redness. I saw changes in my overall skin look and glow. Favourite toner I have used, and there have been a lot!!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,A great exfoliating treatment!,"I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review and I am happy I was able to get my hands on the tatcha texture tonic AHA liquid exfoliating treatment. It is super gentle on the skin, my skin was super smooth after trying for the first time . My pores did appear visibly smaller after using for 3 weeks. It is not drying at all so perfect to use during the colder months. I definitely recommend trying this if you are looking for a gentle way to even your skin tone and texture ."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"This tonic is AMAZING. I don't know how i lived without it before! 
First week of using:
I replaced my toner with this treatment and applied the product on a cotton pad and followed with my typical routine. After a week of using it, my face was super dry and started getting patchy. I was super confused because I have never been disappointed with Tatcha products before so I decided to change it up.
Second week and counting:
I decided to go back to using my toner and then using this tonic after applying toner and applying it straight with my hands (no cotton pad) following with my typical routine and after a week of doing this routine I have seen the build up of white heads on my nose area gone! It has gotten rid of my dry patches as well. I use it daily morning and night time and am so impressed."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Skincare Must Have!,"I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. My goal is to improve my texture and tone. I wanted to see how well this product worked by itself so this was the only thing I changed about my routine, I didn’t use any other tatcha products with it. After just one week I started to see results. My skin was more vibrant and my pores less visible. The product itself is light and doesn’t have a strong smell. I have sensitive skin and it didn’t irritate my face at all. The photos show my skin before I started using it and after 3 weeks. I’m in love and want to try other Tatcha products!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. I've been using Tatcha products for a while but have yet to try the texture tonic so I wanted to give this a shot! First of all, I want to say that I have sensitive skin and Tatcha products can be hit or miss with me. I've been using this for a few weeks now and have seen some improvement with my skin tone evening out. It also helped remove any excess dirt and make up! I used this twice a week as it is an exfoliator and exfoliating every day can be bad for your skin. It's a nice refresher every now and then! And a little goes a long way so you can make it last as long as you want!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,excellent!,"While I love Tatcha’s double cleanse and essence, this texture tonic is amazing! I didn’t think it would make so much difference, but it really does make pores appear smaller and leaves skin petal soft."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,This is my daily gentle exfoliating toner that I use day and night. It also has added benefits like an antioxidants. My skin glows after I’ve been using this. I’m on my second bottle already.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Beautiful toner!,"I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. Firstly, the packaging is absolutely beautiful! This toner is gentle, lightweight, and doesn’t leave behind a sticky residue! I’ve been using this toner 3x a week and noticed some improvements in my combo skin. There was no irritation, and my skin looks calmer and feels smoother. There is a herbal almost licorice scent to it, but it does fade pretty quickly. Overall, this is a lovely toner."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Canada,love. it.,"bought this the day I heard it came out, and it has not disappointed. been using about 2 weeks now. I have some rough texture on the sides of my face, from my temples down an inch. this has definitely made a visible improvement to that area. I also have uneven skintone with lots of redness on my cheeks and chin, and ive noticed that has calmed down a little as well. I use it right after cleansing and before my tatcha essence."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Canada,useless,Didn’t do anything for me whatsoever and I’ve been using it for 2 weeks
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,excellent - does what it says,"I’m not new to the exfoliating toner game, and have tried everything from drugstore cult favorites to luxury spa brands. I’m not giving this five stars lightly; here’s how it stacks up 
- many aha toners leave a sticky, tacky finish. This goes on very light with no residue 
- I’ve been dealing with some redness lately and this has made a noticeable improvement 
- pleasant herbal scent 
- my skin feels smoother and leans matte after use
- has not irritated my sensitive skin 

My only beef is that after about three weeks use 2x/day, the bottle is looking about halfway empty. It’s going to be an expensive habit if it goes that fast, but overall, yeah. This toner brings something new, and if you haven’t found an aha toner you like, maybe give this one a try"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Replacing my peel pads,"I just got this so the review may be too soon but wow, is this amazing.  I love and use a number a Tatcha products but this one has jumped to the top of the list.  I don't use this as my toner, I use a more moisturizing product for that.  I use this in place of the peel pads I used to use.  After about a week, my skin is smoother.  I just love the little bit of tingle I get from it.  So far I'm only using it once a day, over time I might increase it to twice a day.  if you have very sensitive skin, I would do a patch test for a few days first.  While I'm sure younger people will jump on this, I want to assure mature ladies that this is a winner for us too."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,Works amazing. Best toner I’ve used. I have a textured face and it smoothed out my face especially my T zone. I noticed a difference after a week. I will keep purchasing for as long as I can.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Best toner i’ ve ever used,The best toner I have ever used. I have small pimples here and there on my face whole of my life though I used many from expensive to drug store products. But this toner really clears out my face. My teen daughter uses it too and her acnes lessens so much. We use moisturizer on top this toner. I’ll keep buying for more after i run out
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"I love this stuff! I have been using this in addition to the rice wash and the skin soothing repair indigo cream. I have rosacea and this, in combination with the others, has cleared it up almost immediately! I was skeptical about trying a new brand, but this is definitely my new go-to."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"I like this exfoliating toner a lot, as it definitely works, yet is still gentle enough that it would be an ideal starting point for anyone looking to try out/begin using chemical exfoliants in their skincare routine, or for when you want to help prevent congestion. 

Despite applying this immediately after cleansing (which is when you should apply a liquid exfoliant and/or toner), I did find that it took a while to sink in fully, which I suspect is due to the various plant oils included in the ingredients - it's not necessarily a bad thing, since the oils can help offset dryness caused by the acids, but conversely, they can also be irritants on some skin (particularly those sensitive to essential oils). 

It's not a deal breaker, especially since it didn't cause any subsequent absorption issues with any of the products I applied afterwards, but still worth noting. If you like to use multiple products afterwards, definitely give them time to sink in to avoid pilling. I think this will be more useful in warmer weather at reducing oil, and it does help a bit in evening out skin. Definitely depends on your skin type and the climate. On the whole, it's a product I enjoy, but not a game changer. Gifted by Tatcha."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,It works but it's not my favorite.,"This product is a nice toner, however, I think I prefer a toner that also doubles as a moisturizer. I'm sure it pairs wonderfully with their water cream, which I do love. 
I have my eye on another product which will be my go to when this one is out. 
I also don't enjoy the scent, which was disappointing because I usually like Tatcha's scents. Tatcha has good products, but this one doesn't do it for me. If you're unsure, get a sample/travel size and try it first. 
The bottle itself is very sturdy, so you'll need something to put it onto to apply it. 
(Or I suppose you could shake it onto your hand)."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,This product was complimentary from Tatcha and it has evened out my skin tone. I love using this product after a shower when my face is completely clean. I used to use very harsh toners that stripped my skin and I am glad I found this one.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"This texture tonic was gifted by Tatcha in exchange for my review. This beautifully herbal/floral scented toner is housed in an equally stunning bottle. The minty colored glass bottle feels sturdy, though the cap is a bit more fragile since it arrived cracked. Looks aside, the actual product performs! The silky texture exfoliating treatment helps soothe, soften and hydrate the skin. Would definitely keep using!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Oily girl’s BFF,A refreshing tingle was my first impression of this tonic! I have had oily skin my entire life & this was such a lovely addition to my skincare routine. After a full week of use I could feel the difference this was making on my skin. It felt smoother than before! I also noticed that my skin wasn’t getting as oily. I love this! I’ve been using this for nearly a month now & have experienced no irritation or skin sensitivities. My skin is glowing & looks so much healthier!
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Nothing special,Made my skin very oily/shiny and unhealthy looking.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Love it,"This was gifted to me by Tatcha for my honest review. This exfoliant is not only gentle but  it helps calm my redness, it also helps my skin's texture. I really like the results so far and I can't wait to see what else it will do for my skin."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,First the packaging is beautiful and sturdy. It just looks so pretty on my vanity.  This has a nice lightweight formula but it does come with a herbal scent. Not sure everyone will enjoy that. I do enjoy that it makes my skin softer after each use.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,In love,"This is the best toner I've tried so far! It helped me to improve the appearance of my skin I had many black spots due to acne I had tried many products for that but nothing had helped me until I tried this toner, it is really good, the texture is light and it has a refreshing sensation after applying it! 
Complimentary from Tatcha!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"Gifted by Tatcha Beauty for an honest review. The packaging is beautiful. The scent reminds me of licorice and it took a few uses for me to get past the scent, however after I got used to it I was able to really enjoy the product. It left my skin looking and feeling wonderful."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Loving the effects!,"The packaging is beautiful and heavy weight, I love having it on my vanity. It is a little difficult to dispense the product due to the hard walls of the packaging so you have to dribble it out onto a cotton pad. This feels great on my skin and is lightweight, doesn't leave much of a residue at all and leaves me feeling very clean. It has made my skin appear more glowy, plump, and less red after twice a day use for just one week! I love the effects and look forward to using this every day! The only thing I wish were different was the strong herbal scent, but it fades quickly once you use it and I rinse my face after use anyhow. Just something to keep in mind if you have sensitive skin. For reference, I have oily to combination skin.
(This product was gifted by Tatcha for review purposes, all opinions are my own)"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,Canada,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"So far, I'm loving this product. I have sensitive skin and this hasn't caused any issues so far (knock on wood). It also feels nice on the skin and it does seem like my pores are smaller when looking in the mirror."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,In love with packaging and feel,"Loving this product! I received this complimentary from Tatcha, and I have been using it every day for about a week.

TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Level up your skin!,"I received this product complimentary of tatcha and have been incredibly surprised by the results. Aside from the sleek packaging, this product is what you need in your 10 step routine for next level skin! It gives the foundation of bright, even, hydrated, and dew-like skin needed before a perfect full face of makeup. I love how adding this to my skin routine takes my skin to the next level!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Helps control oil,I’m very happy with this! The bottle is so gorgeous and sleek the product inside is quite beautiful too. It’s a gentle formula yet gives me a nice radiant appearance without my skin feeling raw or irritated. It does contain some essential oils so if you are sensitive to those you may want to pass. There isn’t much scent so it’s safe for sensitive people. So far I feel like it’s helping my oily skin to calm down a bit as I blot less during the day.  Gifted by Tatcha
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Nice!,This was gifted by Tatcha. I haven’t tried much of this brand and now I need to try more. This is so nice! I’ve had blackheads on my cheeks and nose lately as well as some texture on my chin. This has made makeup look weird.  Without a lot of use this has improved the texture and blackheads significantly. . My makeup looks a lot smoother! This didn’t irritate or dry out my face.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,My new holy grail,This is the most luxurious gentle toner I’ve ever used. My skin feels so hydrated and silky every time I apply this product. I love to use this product morning and night. This also enhances my makeup foundation routine as well. This product was Complimentary from Tatcha.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Love this,"I received this Texture Tonic complimentary from Tatcha and I am really liking this so far. I like to pour a couple of drops on my palm and pat it into my skin. It's lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. It leaves a soothing cool feeling as it soaks into my skin. I have noticed that my skin looks a lot clearer and brighter. I haven't used it long enough to see much of a difference in my pores. But I love Tatcha, I don't think there has been a product I've tried from them that I haven't loved"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"Firstly, the packaging is everything! Weighty, luxurious and such a joy to look at on my countertop. Secondly, I haven’t been using the texture tonic long enough to have full thoughts but it leaves my skin feeling visibly smoother, and not irritated after about a week of use. Gifted by Tatcha."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"Full disclosure, this product was gifted to me by Tatcha, but I don’t want anyone to waste money so this will be an honest review. If you have oily skin, this is your new BFF. People think oily skin isn’t sensitive, but let me tell you - it definitely can be. I love that this product does a great job of chemically exfoliating, without burning, stinging or stripping the skin. I noticed a difference in the clarity of my skin with just one week of use, every other night. 

Tatcha can do no wrong and they knocked it out of the park with this one again."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,"Lovely light toner, soothing & smoothing","I received the Texture Toner complimentary from Tatcha in exchange for my honest review. I have really loved using this toner. It's slightly acidic, so I use it right after washing my face to prepare it for my next products - cotton pad or patting in with hands works equally well. My skin feels soft and smooth & I have not had any irritation from this. The addition of mugwort was such a wonderful surprise! I love mugwort and it's SO soothing to my skin. The watery texture sinks in quickly and leaves no residue. I'll definitely keep using to see the longer term effects. Also, I love the scent!!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"I’m a sucker for toners just like this! My skin loves Niacinamide and ahas so I was pretty excited to try this. Upon first application I noticed some tightness in my pores but not uncomfortable tightness. So far I’m enjoying this, but I could do without the"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Gentle yet effective AHA toner!,"Everyone seems to have an AHA toner now, but Tatcha still manages to outdo them! I’m loving this gentle yet effective toner; gentle enough to use everyday, but effective enough to see immediate results. My skin looks clearer, more even and smoother after just a week."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Great Gentle and Effective Exfoliant!,"I received this product complimentary from Tatcha for review. This toner has noticeably improved the look and feel of my skin! It makes my skin so soft and smooth. I love how it makes my skin look without makeup on and it makes my makeup go on smoother, too. My skin tends to be on the sensitive side, but I haven't had any irritation from this product, even when using it alongside other actives in my routines. Everything about using this toner feels so effortless- how it absorbs into my skin, layers with other products, and fits into my routines."

I would honestly use this as my sole product after cleansing because it gives my face everything it needs to be healthy and clear.
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,"Gifted by Tatcha. This is a great exfoliant ffor beginners. it is not stripping and did not make my skin purge. although it is pricier, i think it is worth it for those who love japanese skincare products"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Yes please,"I was kindly gifted by Tatcha the Tatcha texture tonic AHA Liquid Exfoliating Treatment and let me tell y’all, if you haven’t tried this stuff, I highly recommend. This is the first Tatcha product I’ve ever tried but I finally understand what the rave is all about. My skin is combination to oily in the winter and combination to oily in the summer but pores and texture are always an issue. After using this tonic for a couple of weeks, my skin is starting to look and feel more soft and smooth. The packaging adds aesthetic to my vanity and the tonic does wonders for my skin.

The packaging of this product is stunning. The color and feel is just so pretty! The texture of the product itself is very light and watery and has a very unique fruity (yet somewhat herbal) scent to it. My skin has felt so good from using it and I'm definitely going to use it up, though it makes me a bit sad at how $$$ it is. Will definitely be on the lookout to trying other Tatcha products in the future too!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Incredible Texture Toner,"I have been applying this texture tonic morning and night and sometimes in the middle of the day, for the past couple weeks. It helps take away excess oil, without drying me out. I am really impressed by how quickly the results have happened! Right out of the luxurious, beautiful, tall glass bottle, I apply the watery texture formulation onto a cotton round pad. I swipe it on my face and it absorbs quickly. It does a fabulous job at hydrating and plumping my oily/combination skin. With consistent use, my skin now appears brighter, more even, all while reducing redness. I struggle with clogged pores and oiliness in my t-zone and I've experienced no issues while using this gentle chemical exfoliation. I have noticed a significant difference in my pores being smaller and uneven texture more visibly even. I definitely recommend giving this incredible tonic toner a try!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Hydrating and gentle!,"I received this product complimentary from tatcha. One thing about my exfoliants is that they have to be hydrating and gentle- this one hit all the points! I really love how it didn’t sting my skin and left it feeling hydrated after application.

TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Beautiful Product and Beautiful Results,"I received this gifted by Tatcha but I really value being honest in reviews because I wouldn’t want y’all to waste money on an okay product. So here we go: I use retinoids from my Derm often so my skin is quite sensitive to acids. I was able to ease this into my routine carefully and have actually really been liking it. I did go through a slight purging in the beginning bc I dont use AHAS a lot but ive gotten used to it and my skin is loving it. It feels smooth and healthy. I pair it with very moisturizing products because i don’t want to strip my skin. I have been using this twice a week and seeing results. Not sure if I would buy this with my own money as a college student because this is def out of my budget but if you can afford it, get it!!! Really amazing product and makes you feel boujee and beautiful."
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,So far so good!,"I received this gifted by Tatcha for my honest review. 
i have acne prone, textured, super oily skin so I totally need chemical exfoliants. I love my P50 lotion, however, while effective, it sometimes stings and the scent is kind of rough. This on the other hand is gentle, smells a little citrusy, and hasn't broken me out yet! So far so good. I prefer this user experience and it might just replace my P50!"
TATCHA-The Texture Tonic,USA,Tatcha The Texture Tonic,Love this new aha toner from Tatcha! It works to chemically exfoliate your skin and left my skin smoother and less dull overall. I would say that it is gentle enough for all skin types which makes it a great option for someone who is new to chemical exfoliants

ESTÉE LAUDER-Micro Essence Skin Activating Treatment Lotion Fresh with Sakura Ferment,Singapore,Just so so ,I have tried the original version before and I love it. Expected this new version to be the same or better. I should have bought the small bottle and try first. It’s dry fast and doesn’t make my skin feels hydrated. 
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,The only toner I want to go back to!,I’ve finished two bottles of the La Mer toner and I actually miss using it when I switched to another product.

LA MER-The Tonic,Singapore,La Mer tonic,"This was my first time buying La Mer toner. it was a very good deal during sales for 200ml. the toner was smell on skin and the smell was great. will get it only with sales.
"
LA MER-The Tonic,Malaysia,Just a normal toner. ,"This is just a normal toner, don’t expect to have special effect considering the price. It’s just a normal toner, it does not shrink pores or makes your skin radiant. Just a normal toner that preps your skin for next skincare regime. That’s all. For the price, get any other cheaper toner, this is an overpriced toner. "
LA MER-The Tonic,Malaysia,love it!,I do used la mer products’s range. And i love it. It fresh up my face after used it with cotton pad. Basically its like used toner. Tighten the pores. I will repurchase it and now 2nd bottle. It dosnt make my skin any big changes which is good. Thank you la mer for good products .
LA MER-The Tonic,Singapore,absorbs easily,"The tonic absorbs easily without leaving a sticky feel after application, unlike a lot of toners which leaves a sticky feel when dried up. I would definitely keep it as part of my daily routine. "
LA MER-The Tonic,Malaysia,not suitable for me,"this product is not suitable for me but I saw many good reviews from other people. I might be a bit young to use La Mer or maybe I need to try whole range, but its expensive. "
LA MER-The Tonic,Singapore,A nice toner or tonic ,I do not know if its a toner or tonic… I just pat it into my skin after my Clea De Peau toner… Feels nice on the skin and smells expensive. Still do not know if my skin needs it or not … 
LA MER-The Tonic,Malaysia,Absorb in a sec ,"Keep falling in love with the first application. I really like the texture of this toner, its non-sticky, quickly absorbs, pleasant smell and the skin feels soft immediately. Although the price point is a bit high for the toner but I will keep repurchase it again and again because this is the best toner I have ever used."
LA MER-The Tonic,Malaysia,double cleaning and fairly ,Alrzady 3 years im using this products. It's very nice and comfortable for me. I likes to use it twice a days. Before starting make up and after bath. Its helps refreshing our hair skin as well 
LA MER-The Tonic,Malaysia,best toner ever ,I didn’t think that toner is important for my face but once i try this one my face is change feel completely different clean and pore is smaller i can’t live without this toner anymore 
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,Lamer Tonic,So refreshing and clean.  Absolutely love this Lamer face tonic.
LA MER-The Tonic,Malaysia,tonic,"I never thought a toner could change you life, lol. But it can! Well, I was using the Gel de la Mer for a while now I thought introducing other La Mer products, step by step, just to see how my skin will react to it and make a full La Mer regime. 

So I bought this toner instead of the blue one, even if I am kind of an oily gal."
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,La Mer The Tonic - 200ml,This is my absolute favorite toner. Only reason i’m giving it four stars is because the top broke off after a few uses and it’s pretty pricey to be falling apart. Other than that it’s a must have.
LA MER-The Tonic,Malaysia,Gentle toner ,This toner is very gentle on the skin. It doesn't strip off any moisture and do not have any tingling feeling post laser treatment which goes to show how gentle it is. Will repurchase 
LA MER-The Tonic,Singapore,Lamer Toner,"My 3rd bottle. Love how gentle and nourishing it is at the same time, my skin loves it. It calms & preps my face for my next skincares like serum, moisturiser etc "
LA MER-The Tonic,Malaysia,First time use!,"It is not the best toner, but I kind a like it too. The price is quite expensive to justify on the functions, anyway it is worth to try. Go and try by yourself!"
LA MER-The Tonic,Malaysia,Ms ,Bought for my aunt as a birthday gift last year. Just asked her for her review. She said the product doesn’t do any different on her face . Just overpriced for not doing nothing much. 
LA MER-The Tonic,Malaysia,worth every penny,I like to believe this is a hard working toner that help to give my skin undeniable glow and improved uneven texture parts of my face. Leaving my sensitive skin feels so resilient and nourished. Never regret adding this to my routine. Also a great prep for serum and moisturizer after
LA MER-The Tonic,Malaysia,not really suits my skin,"Ermmm how to say ehh for this product. When using this lotion, it makes my skin feel tight and bit dry. Honestly, i didn’t see improvement or changes when using this lotion. Oh By the way it has mild smell. "
LA MER-The Tonic,Malaysia,My Fav Toner! ,"My second purchase! I love it! 
The toner is light. The smell is pleasant. Not strong. My skin feels soft and radiant after using this. Great product from La Mer!
"
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,La Mer The Tonic - 200ml,"So good! I had tried the tonic for oily skin (I don’t think Sephora carries it?) and it made my skin look beautiful for about ten minutes till it became a grease trap. I tried this because it has pretty much the same ingredients but this is alcohol free and WOW. The first couple of days I feel like my skin did get a little oilier but after a couple of weeks my skin feels a lot more balanced. Not oily at all, but moisturized and glowing. Nothing I have tried has faded my acne scars as quickly as this did, either. Definitely an amazing product!"
LA MER-The Tonic,Malaysia,my first lamer ,It’s only been a week but i can feel my skin’s texture has improved slightly. I have combination skin. Can’t wait to try the cream — when my bank account allows it. Hahaha
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,La Mer The Tonic - 200ml,"Worth every penny! I have been dealing with a perioral dermatitis flare up for the last two months, and after a few days of using the tonic my skin is finally calming down and healing itself. I also notice the rest of my face is more hydrated and actually glowing! Love this product."
LA MER-The Tonic,Singapore,Mrs,This is my second bottle of this wonderful la mer toner. It works quite gently on my face without drying it out. I use it twice daily and would highly recommend it if you have combination skin like I do. 
LA MER-The Tonic,Canada,La Mer The Tonic - 200ml,My relationship with la mer is like a marriage now. I refuse to use anything else. Will be using for life. Thank you la mer
LA MER-The Tonic,Malaysia,instant smooth feelings,Only used nightly for the past week and can feel the instant smoothness on my skin. No breakout thank goodness as I have a sensitive combination skin. Will definitely repurchase. Dont mind the price point since it is La Mer and the result did not disappoint!
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,"Meh, stings","My mom is a huge La Mer fan, and as such I got a bottle of this from her. It's not bad but I'm not sure it really did anything for my skin honestly and stings when I put it on. I did not end up finishing the bottle she gave me and will not be purchasing for myself."
LA MER-The Tonic,Malaysia,mrs,Left my skin moisture after applied the tonic - mine is combination skin. Do Note that some other brands do left your skin dry after toner/tonic. still hv minor odour but still manageable. 
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,La Mer The Tonic - 200ml,"I love the tonic itself but not the packaging. The silver thin film keeps coming off and I can find on my skin.
I used half of it and I am not happy every time when I open the bottle."
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,La Mer The Tonic - 200ml,I would like to purchase it again! It is truly suitable for oily and sensitive skin
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,La Mer The Tonic - 200ml,"I’ve never been a big toner user, until now!!! I’m so happy with my skin’s overall look and feel after adding this to my routine."
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,Good Toner,A good after cleanser toner but I prefer the micellar water on my combination skin
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,Love,I love this toner. It is the perfect way to start off my skincare routine.
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,Amazing product!,"I love anything La Mer but this is my absolute favorite besides the creme. It tones my skin without stripping and leaves me with an undeniable glow! My sensitive skin feels nourished and my texture has improved. Also, the smell is lovely."
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,Not For Acne Prone Skin,"So I have been using this for about two weeks and I know that is not enough time to see complete results but I will say this tones skin really well. One thing about La Mer is the concern of synthetic fragrances and dyes. There is less than 1% fragrance in this product which makes me feel better but there is red dye. Although it’s one of the last ingredients on the list, red dye is extremely irritating and can cause you to breakout. I ignored this fact because it was one of the last ingredients, but it did make my cheeks breakout in a way I’ve never seen before. Everyone who has acne prone skin is different, so if you want to try it maybe it’ll work better for you! And if it does break you out just switch toners and it’ll heal. Overall it’s an okay toner, but be careful if you’re acne prone. Another downside is the packaging, it’s literally cheap plastic- it looks nice but does not give you that luxury feeling that you’d expect from this brand. SK-II toner is cheaper than this and it’s solid glass, just saying."
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,La Mer The Tonic - 200ml,"WORTH EVERY PENNY. Saw a major difference after about a week of using, giving my skin a new glow & helped dull, uneven texture parts of my face."
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,Refreshing and Hydrating,Great prep for my serum and moisturizer! Leaves my skin feeling so resilient and hydrated.
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,LOVE everything about this toner except the $$$,"I have dropped nearly all La Mer products from my skin care regimen due to cost, but find that I simply cannot give up this toner. I have tried several other toners, hoping to find something a little more affordable, yet equally as effective, but nothing works for me like this one. It makes my skin feel clean, happy and refreshed, never tight or dry. My skin feels calm and perfectly prepped for my essence that follows. I just wish my pocket book was as happy as my skin."
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,must have!!,"Love this toner... doesn’t strip my skin of the little moisture it has, while getting off all of the leftover soft and residue. Leaves my skin feeling supple, soft and moisturized..One of the best toners I’ve ever used. If there’s one thing you could only splurge on from this line, I would recommend the toner."
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,La Mer The Tonic - 200ml,"I like the product but the packaging is cheap. I don't think when I pay $95.00 for a toner, that the silver around the top should flake off. I am about 1/3 into the bottle and noticed I had silver flakes on my fingers and face after using the La Mer Toner. Looked down and realized the silver around the top opening of the bottle was flaking off. I am so disappointed and frankly angry that now I have to be careful using the Toner not to get these silver flakes everywhere. I won't be repurchasing."
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,PRICEY!,Why is it so expensive? What is the secret? The tears of Jesus?!
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,Gotta Be in It for the Long Haul,"I think many misunderstand that this product is a long term investment. 

For reference, I have very dry skin. When I purchased this product to compliment my cleanser, my skin care regime included once a week exfoliation, a hyaluronic acid based cleanser on the daily, moisturizing two times a day, and using sun screen religiously. Initially, I was shocked and pleased at how much residual makeup this toner picked up that the cleanser left behind. My skin was noticeably softer as well. However, the product had yet to really blow me away like some of the other skin care items in my arsenal and I seriously was contemplating not repurchasing. After all, I was still experiencing a hormonal spot or two every now then; I just didn’t see the dramatic change I had been hoping for.

Then, a couple of months in and half way through the bottle, I was staring in the mirror one day and to my surprise my face was “glowing” as it never had before. To add to that, I suddenly realized I had bypassed Zit City that month too. I found the effect quite stunning and it was at that moment I became a convert. Absolutely a must have for anyone truly serious about skin care."
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,Hydrated Skin,After cleaning I use the La Mer Tonic or La Mer Treatment Lotion (or layer both) to bring back hydration on skin. Feels great. Follow with La Mer Cream or SoftCream (pat down thin layer). It locks down hydrated skin and no breakout.
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,La Mer The Tonic - 200ml,This toner changed my life!!! My skin has never been better!
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,OBSESSED!!!,This is the most amazing tonic. I feel instant satisfaction every time I use it. My skin feels soft and plump. One of my favorite parts of my regimen. Will continue to repurchase!
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,Made me dry and oily,"May just not be made for me. In the recent years, my skin has turned from dry and oily to normal (not dry, not oily, just very balanced) probably from all the great skincare I've invested in the recent years. When I used this, it made my foundation look dry and oily again! I use the La mer foundation and La mer Treatment primer and LOVE both, so thought I'd try this.. but it made the la mer foundation just sit on top, look powdery and after 2 hours I was so oily! Next day I had 3 tiny red bumps on my face, irritation maybe? I waited awhile to let it dry down on my skin, but it still had a sticky finish. Going to stick with my Korean and sk2 toners."
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,La Mer The Tonic - 200ml,This product is okay. There is nothing special about it. I use La Mer cleansing water in the am and was hoping for this to be a pm toner. I will save money by getting a cheaper toner for the evening. And splurge on other La Mer products. I will say this would be good if you don’t want a drying toner. This does not dry out your skin at all. I also feel like it doesn’t do much.
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,THE BEST,"This is my can’t live with out product - seriously, I have traveled before without taking the big bottle on the plane, and my skin was a wreck after just a few days without using it. I have super sensitive, oily skin with rosacea - yay me! EVERYTHING irritates my skin, but not this. I use it with an exfoliating cotton pad every time I wash my face - it removes makeup residue or just dirt, and hydrated and calms my skin! Worth every penny!"
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,Glow that comes with a price tag,"This unfortunately makes my skin glow, the unfortunate being the price of course. The formula is very hydrating and after using it for the past 2 months I noticed a certain healthy-glowing complexion on my skin. 

Will look for the dupe in the meantime but I am very open to repurchase the product in the future if I don’t find anything as good as this."
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,Buy! Buy! Buy!,I was using seabreeze to get that “clean” feeling and try to keep away acne and I took a chance and added this to my LaMer skincare regime and I absolutely love this. It balances the ph levels of my skin and completely got rid of what acne I had especially around my hairline on the high points of my cheekbones. It doesn’t irritate and I have severe eczema! Definitely a repurchase and recommend. Worth the money!
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,I’m in tears,"I was hesitant to buy this because of the price and negative reviews I read. I have to say it has done miracles to my skin within 2 weeks of using it along with the La Mer treatment lotion. I have a skin picking disorder and I’ve always had ugly scars, dark spots on my face, huge pores and some acne due to picking. My skin has aged so much over the years and I’m only 22 years old, it’s sad. Today my skin is glowing and my pores look way smaller, scars are finally fading away. I literally couldn’t believe my eyes when I stood in front of the mirror this morning, for the first time in 14 years I see an improvement on my skin! I tried other similar products, the “best” out there with no luck. This might not make a difference for you if you’re skin is not damaged, but mine really really was. I’m forever thankful for La Mer!"
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,Good product,This product calms the skin and it's not irritating at all. I don't know if it helps with reducing breakouts but so far it hasn't done anything wrong.
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,La Mer The Tonic - 200ml,"You guys, this gives me life everytime I use it. Not sure what it smells like but it's honestly so good. I've been using it twice a day for a month and I'm just under halfway through the large bottle. It's at my limit in terms of justifying being a recurring customer but that smell is intoxicating. It feels great on my skin and seems to help control oiliness, definitely helps with pores, and is just such a pleasant and not to mention alcohol free product to use."
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,i like it,Removes any residual traces of makeup after cleansing and leaves me feeling hydrated. Getting ready to repurchase
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,Liquid Perfection!!!,I have super sensitive skin and have tried sooo many products.  This one is perfect.  I had no breakouts or red skin due to use.  I love it and will certainly be ordering again.  The cost is high - but worth it!!!
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,La Mer The Tonic - 200ml,Not for sensitive skin! I had a terrible tingling sensation after trying this on some areas!
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,La Mer The Tonic - 200ml,I was looking for a replacement for the toner I was using and I decided to try this out. This toner is incredible. Before my skin would have maybe a pimple or two. Now it has been perfectly clear since I started using this toner. It is incredible. I highly recommend trying it out!
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,Not worth.....,"I have used La Mer for like two years and recently switched to Cle De Peau. Not because the cream and serum is bad, your skin will get tired of the same skincare product that you have been using. Among all La Mer products, I'd say this one is the most useless one. NOT WORTH IT!!!! I have very dry and sensitive skin, this toner literarily does nothing...... And it smells a little weird to me..... I would suggest the cream and also the treatment lotion, but don't spend that much money on this toner!"
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,great all in one,Great toned works well as a toner and remove make up after the gym
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,Not the best,"Why does sephora not post my review on this??
I've written one four times now.... Anyway, this seemed to give me little bumps and blemishes and was a tad drying. Its a miss for me."
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,Pricy but love it,It is expensive for a toner but I really love it. It helps clean my skin and make sure there is nothing left over from cleansing. It does not burn or strip my skin like other toners. This is a staple in my skin care routine and my skin has been the best it has ever been.
LA MER-The Tonic,USA,Wonderful!,I was worried about spending so much on a product but this stuff is with the hype. It's an amazing toner and makes my skin look smooth and even. It also works super well as a sheet mask using dry sheet masks or peelable cotton pads. I'm really pleased with this. The price is steep but the product is great.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,Malaysia,An okay product,It does not give me such a big impact. Not negative and not positive. But kind of hydrating but nothing change much in terms of skin barrier or moisturizing.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,Singapore,Okay Toner,"This is an okay toner. It does not irritate my skin. However, it has a weird smell. I am not sure if this is the aloe vera natural smell."
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,Singapore,Mario badescu ,Mario badescu aloe vera toner fulfills it's basic function as a toner . It feels gentle on my skin and i  did not have any adverse reaction . value for money 
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,Singapore,Average,"Giving this a 3-star review as it doesn’t really make a difference. It’s a very mild toner so don’t expect too much. I’ve used this mainly because sometimes I have sensitive skin and develop rashes on my forehead and this helps to calm my skin down. Other than that, it’s an average product."
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,Malaysia,ok,"Not hydrating enough, feel like I’m just wiping my face with tap water. Overall it’s worth for its price, but will not repurchase. I would prefer this face mist over this one
"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,Singapore,cooling toner,I Bought the toner  during the promotion to try it out after hearing much about this brand. Not much impact on my skin and it feels like a typical off counter toner. Not sure if I will buy this again.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,Singapore,Pretty Good Toner,Am a fan of MB. Especially love their toners. Value for money if we’re talking about quantity and quality of product as compared to other brands with almost the same product quality but pricier tags. Will alway come back to MB toners if I’m on a budget.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,Singapore,toner,"i have used quite a number of other type of toner but this one seems the best one of all...........
it suits for all types of skin....
this is my third purchase. 
confirm will repurchase. "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,Singapore, Good product but...,Good product & mild on face  but this is not suitable for my type of sensitive skin.  I don't this so I will be purchasing this again. my skin turns red
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,Malaysia,not bad ,"It is very gentle to skin. Thus, very suitable for someone with sensitive skin. Otherwise, I never saw any difference it made to skin. Don’t think will repurchase it again"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Just a normal toner,Just trying out this new aloe Vera toner. But I prefer the Mario badesco rose water toner. It’s more mosturising. I will just finish this bottle and won’t repurchase this again. 
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,toner,the toner is just okay for the purpose of make skin refreshed and less dry but not the purpose of cleaning like mirecellar water did. still have makeup residue. 
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,toner ,"First try , Smells good and suit for my skin , because i have dry and sensitive skin . I had tried many brand of toner before , but this is the best toner ever to me "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,2nd bottle,"Finishing my second bottle soon. I don't see any significant changes, but it works well as a toner. No breakouts and the price range is okay as compared to toner from other brands."
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Good but....,"I bought this product thinking it will help me achieve the skin that I prefer. I’m really not sure if it works. Like aloe vera gels, it gave an instant moisture & soothing effect on my skin.

It’s good but I don’t think it’s the best. There’s probably a better toner than this one. "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,No frills hydrating toner,I've always liked Mario Badescu products but this is a pretty average toner but I think it's worth its value. It worked well hydrating and prepping my skin after cleansing but doesn't seem to do much besides that. 
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,mario badescu aloe vera toner,"simple no frills toner. smells pretty good iirc. light, probably good for sensitive skin but doesn't exactly provide great hydration or do much for my skin."
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,At first- it stung. But now it works wonders.,"I bought this product on November 2018 but since I live “overseas” (the products came from Singapore)- I received it 2 weeks after (around December). I bought this with the Acne Facial Cleanser. At first- it hurt my skin since I was not used to using toners but eventually, my skin got used to it- and I saw noticeable results. My skin got smoother & it felt much rejuvenated. I recommend purchasing this product- and I bought another one last week since the one that I ordered is now almost empty. :’>"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,recommended ,"Repeated purchase, probably my 3rd bottle.  Good for sensitive skin.  Light.  No strong smell or perfume.  Price is average for its size.  Recommended."
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,simple tonner,Just simple toner. I feel not very moisturizing. No alcohol is a plus but doing not much difference to my skin. There are better toners in the market better than this for the same price. 
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Nice and light,The toner was refreshing but I didn't feel like it cleansed my skin so much of the residual dirt after washing with a cleanser. I prefer to use it as a mist to keep my face hydrated throughout the day rather than as a cleansing toner.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Very badic,This is a nice basic to have when you want to dampen the skin after cleansing before using a serum or moisturizer. By itself it does not do much but I like it when my skin feels sensitive.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,decent smell,"This is my first try on this brand. I really love the smell very light and pleasent. I am looking forward to try others like cleanser, moisturiser and such. Worth the price 😁"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,ok.....,I bought this for my sister and she said that it did nothing to her..........so I doubt I'm purchasing this again.......There's better alternatives in this market.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Soothes skin,"my cheeks are naturally a lil flushed from skin irritation and it did help a lil but not as much as I thought it would be. It's a lil moisturizing as well but nothing that really wow-ed me. Oh and if you have sensitive skin, it doesn't cause a break-out!"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,like a normal toner,This product did nothing to me just like a normal toner but for that price point it’s disappointing. So far mario badescu products some are ok some are really bad. 
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,The best so far,I have been using this product for a year now and i must say this is an effective product. My acne prone skin tamed down and now i feel so confident and has that healthy skin glow.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Good Toner,"I needed a toner that has no alcohol and fragrances and this was what I came across on. Works well with my skin, it has been a month plus and no breakouts even when I am PMS-ing. 
There is little to no smell."
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Good for skin,Has been used about 3 months. Really good for my skin. Highly recommended to my friends. Definitely will repurchase again. Totally Worth to buy and  satisfied.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Mario badescu,"I sooo love this Mario Badescu Toner, because of its mild and alcohol free toner. Its perfect for everyday use,without strong smell and strong ingredient for a face toner. The price is just so right for a big bottle.
My son, whose a teenager also uses this for his face and it lessens his pimples.
For sure , i will buy again this product once i consume all my first bottle.
"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Love this,"I Love the mild cucumber scent. I also Love that its alcohol free so it works well for my dry and sensitive skin. Price is okay too, not too expensive for the amount of Product you get. Dont like the cover though coz it spilled a bit in transit. Other than that, I will definitely repurchase!!!"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,great for combination skin!,"The best part about this toner, is that its alchohol free!!! Doesn't sting your face as compared to other brands, leaves a matte and smooth finish. Felt that my face is cleansed instead of having more product stacked on top. Repurchased my second bottle👍"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Love or hate,I cant say if I love this toner. tho I think its only purpose is to moisturised the skin. There are other toners out there that can do the same job. I would rather use my aloe vera mist than this.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,great for sensitive skin,brought this toner on behalf of my boyfriend as he have really sensitive skin which results in having oily skin. initially brought it as I'm aware that aloe vera is good to relieve senstive skin. was really glad that this toner has similar effects as using real aloe vera.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Good,"First of all, it soothes the face after cleansing. With the quick-absorbing texture, it leaves a fresh feeling while hydrating the face. It is even better to apply using a cotton puff. "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Good Toner,This toner has helped brighten my skin. I don't give it 5 stars as sometimes it dried out my skin too much and I had dry skin but overall it did help me with acne
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Gentle toner,Gentle toner that doesn’t dry out my sensitive and dry skin. The price point is also a plus. I always recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin as it is alcohol free.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,10/10,super gentle on the skin because it’s alcohol free! makes my skin very smooth and removed excess dirt. subtle smell! already using my 4th bottle. highly recommend to any one who’s looking for a toner that’s gentle on the skin 
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Best value for money,One of the better toners. I have been using this. This is my 5th bottle. It is gentle and hydrating toner . It doesn’t sting and helps to tone down redness too! Sometime I decan it into a spray bottle as a hydrating spray. Value for money for such a big bottle! 
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,so-so,It doesn’t have any smell but i made my skin hydrated and becme more soft and clear . Its a great combination if you use this with MD silver powder for pores ❤️ will repurchase this for sure . You can feel it on ur first try 
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,"gentle, good for sensitive skin","very gentle toner, good for sensitive skin. mild fragrance. one down side is that this toner does not effectiveness remove any residual dirt or makeup like other toners as it is very gentle, have to make sure face is cleansed properly."
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Decent toner,"My skin type is combination skin, my skin tends to get oily in the t-zone area...however this toner help to gently clean and soothe my skin and does not cause irtitation to my skin...But, as for my opinion, eventhough i finish whole bottle of this toner, but it does not provide the optimum result..."
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,fave toner for dry skin,"The Mario badescu aloe Vera toner is my favourite toner, I have dry-normal skin and when I put this on it feels super refreshing. 1 bottle lasts me months and I keep ordering more for back up so I don’t run out"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Meh,it's a good hydrating toner that works but i dont think there is anything special about it. i just finished the bottle and i practically used it for everything just so i can say that i used it. this is not something that i will buy again cos i dont think it's worth the money. there are many toners with lower prices that work better than this one
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Good as a morning toner.,It's very light and just refreshing. I think it is best to be used in the morning specially if your face will be exposed a lot of time to the sun. It's really good for sensitive skin and those who has a skin type that easily gets dry.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Aloe-allied!,Toner is not harsh on the skin and most importantly does not dry up my skin. The aloe is gives a calming effect to the skin. The toner scores another point as the toner does not have strong smell to it. 
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Water?,"It is very mild. Too mild that you feel like you are using water with slight smell and color.
I would not repurchase because I do not feel my skin being clean afterwards unlike what you know a toner should do.
"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Refreshing,It feels refreshing and nice after washing my face. Skin feels soft especially after it feeling dry. It also helps with removing excessive dirt. It takes more than three months for the bottle to empty. I would think that it is worth the price.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Gentle Toner,"I don't see any changes on my skin, but at the same time, I don't mind it. It does what a gentle toner does, it wont dry your skin or anything. The cucumber smell is barely there at all. I can see myself purchasing this again, but not straight after I finish this bottle. "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Great toner!,"I have oily, sensitive skin. I'm not a fan of toners because they tend to dry out my skin too much and end up breaking me out further. I gave this one a go after reading some good reviews and good thing I did! It's gentle, doesn't sting on the skin and eyes, non-drying, and makes my skin feel even more refreshed. I use this after washing my face with the MB Glycolic cleanser and I think the two goes well together. My noticed that my skin condition improved as I don't break out as much anymore even on *those days. Will definitely repurchase!"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,smells good! ,This toner helped clear my face and neck because I had visible acne scars and this toner helped me achieve a clear skin! I love this toner and the smell is not strong. Worth it and lasts for a long time. 
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Soothe & calm sensitive combination skin,"This aloe vera toner calms and soothes my sensitive skin. I have combination skin and my skin felt ""balance"" after application as it was oil-free without any dryness or tightness. I was delighted that I gave this toner a try and would recommend it. "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,mild,very suitable to be used to sooth skin after heavy routine such as scrub and mask. leaves the skin feels clean and fresh! does not irritate the skin and i have a very sensitive skin. but it does not give ang significant rwsults yeat. mybe too early just using it for 2 weeks.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Regular toner,"Nothing much to shout about, as this feels and works like a regular toner so the price is a little steep for a bottle that won't last beyond months. I prefer the glycolic acid toner but it was out of stock so I purchased this instead."
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Gentle on my skin,My first time trying this brand but I'd say it's gentle on skin and worth the buy! Doesn't dry out my skin and I use this without worries! This bottle lasts me quite a while. I wished it'll be a little more affordable though. 
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Light Cleansing Toner ,Lightweight toner that works with my sensitive and acne-prone skin. It doesn't agitate my skin. Skin feels very smooth and clean after using this. Been using it every day since Feb'17 and I'm halfway through the bottle.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Not for me,"Using this left my skin red for a few minutes. I have sensitive and acne prone skin. I don't have enough basis to say this is not good, but I can say it's not a good one for my skin at least.

And sephora wants 200 characters. "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Calming,This toner is much more watery than other MB toners. However it is very calming and soothing for sensitive and acne prone skin like mine. I use the special cucumber toner mostly but use this when I have a terrible acne breakout. I also use this when I'm out in the sun for a long time and I feel I need this to calm my sun exposed face. Overall an ok toner but I wouldn't use this as my main toner.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Just good.,"This does not really work for my skin. Maybe because I have an oily skin and this formula doesn't really work for me. I think its more suitable for sensitive skin :) However, I love the smelllllll soo soothing!"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Good. BUT...,"Nothing to shout about. Don't get me wrong, this was pleasant to use, BUT... I see no difference with a drug store-bought toner. Save yourself a few bucks and skip this (unless you're OCD and like your skincare as a complete set)"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Really light weight,"Love the product. It has no odd smell to it, and I can feel it hydrating and cooling my skin. Really light weight and great for all skin types. Have since quite a bit of improvement to my skin since trying this product."
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,There are better or similar products at lower prices ,"This feels comforting and soothing for my skin. However, I much prefer the body shop aloe toner as it is cheaper, more readily available to purchase and the overall efficacy better. I will stick with body shop of this product as I wasn't impressed with MB's. "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Nothing great!,I bought the toner because it seem to promise a lot of benefits plus no chemical etc etc... but I didnt find anything great about it. Also it felt very watery and as if I was just putting water on my face.I shall definately not repurchase this  product.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Plain and boring,I've tried all and this might be the worse toner from MB. Did I just bought water? The consistency is just like plain water and no supporting Aloe Vera scent. It's totally plain and boring for its price.  Maybe it is intended for the most sensitive skin but kinda good if they at least made it cheaper. I'm not recommending this.  MB Chamomile Lotion is way better than this but with the same price. MB Glycolic Toner is the best but pricey though. 
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,More Mild,"This toner is tend to be more mild than the Glycolic Acid. This one.. Skin feel refresh each time use,  but sorry I still prefer Glycolic Acid toner as I have an oily face, thus personally still prefer the Glycolic Acid (more clean feel)"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Nice,"This is so lovely!! I really do love this brand. It makes my face feel less tight after cleansing. It also doesn't make my face feel dry either as after cleansing it can sometimes feel like that. Instead it feels ""normal"" and smells nice too. "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Good... except for the paraben ingredient,"I switched to this toner when the other aloe vera toner I was trying out failed to calm down my acne and actually made it worse. Like the MB enzyme gel cleanser, I don't consider this a miracle product but I did experience some improvements on my skin after I started using it. It did not stop me from breaking out but at least it didn't make it worse. After trying out so many products I am almost willing to settle down with this one. Almost, because beware! This toner contains paraben. I still think though that for people with oily/acne-prone/sensitive skin this toner is worth trying out though despite the paraben ingredient."
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Holy Grail Toner,"So far this is the only toner that does not irritate my sensitive skin, i've tried a lot of toner to see if there's anything to replace it due to the price. But at the end, quality or quantity, definitely my holy grail toner."
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Great toner,"This is my first Mario Badescu, and it is definitely not the last! This toner is really calming and soothing. It does not irritate the skin or cause breakouts. And it is really affordable for such a big bottle! "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Makes my skin feel very refreshed,This is hands down the best toner i have ever used. It is so gentle and soothing on my skin and perfect for anyone with dry or and sensitive. A little goes a long way so its very good value for money. it works best on a cotton pad and removes any last parts of makeup you may have missed after cleansing
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Fresh!,been looking around on luxola for a toner and im so glad that i found this! :) i love how this toner is alcohol-free and is really gentle on the skin. this toner also calms my skin down and makes it look a look clearer and cleaner. i paired this up with another night cream from Mario Badescu and it became the best duo. highly recommended!
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Great for sensitive skin,"I have quite sensitive skin and I tried using a few other toners before and even though it's stated as ""alcohol-free"", I find them to be very drying. This aloe vera toner, however, feels really mild and after using it for quite some time, I actually found the black heads on my nose to be lesser than before. I even bought a few more bottles in case this is out of stock :)"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Pleasant but nothing WOW.,"This is a very gentle toner and it does its job but doesn't wow me. I guess it is just supposed to cater for sensitive skin so that it doesn't break them out any further. So far, it is very neutral toner that doesn't really wow me in anyway. I won't say no to buying it but i would try other products after finishing this "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Mario badescu,"Wasn't really a fan of this set.. The mask has a really weird smell and i hate it. But for the pimple spot, it was generally ok :) Something similar to one of my high end daily skin care routine. Can give it a try if you're just  a beginner looking for something v gentle. Other than that, nope.. wouldnt recommend it."
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Cheap and effective toner,"A simple and soothing toner. Works great as an everyday toner for day and night. A useful tip - soak a cotton pad in this toner, press and hold against any inflamed pimples or broken skin. It helps me to disinfect and sooth any angry pimples. Remember to apply a good pimple cream too - I love MB drying lotion."
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Normal toner,The Aloe Vera toner does the job of toning the skin. I wouldn't say it's the best toner I've used but it isn't the worst either. it's an okay toner for me all in all. And I wouldn't go rushing out to buy another when I finish this bottle.
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Great Product!,Great toner ! I have hyper sensitive skin and this is a suitable product for me ! It is unscented and skin feels more moisture after applying it. Recommend to use after cleansing your face. Will purchase more ! :)
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Aloe Vera Toner ,"I LOVE THIS TONER!!!!!!!!!!!!! For the price, it comes in 236ml which is super worth it. It's a huge bottle and if you're thinking of getting it, GET IT NOW. I have very sensitive skin and this does not break me out or anything. It is very mild and has a light scent to it. I use it twice a day. "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,"Gentle toner , okay buy","Gentle toner, not much effect on skin, but good for sensitive skin. A bit pricy, but you can use for a long time, given its such a huge bottle.

Must use within 6 months because of the expiry duration"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Gentle on the skin,Have finished this toner which i bought sometime and i love it as it is very gentle on the skin and my skin feels refreshed after using it. Am still waiting for this to be back in stock again! Will surely get it again when it's back!
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Love it,"this product is so light weight and it makes my face feels really supple and soft. doesnt have much smell to it and my skin feels very refreshed. for a person who wears makeup almost everyday, i love how this product preps my skin for makeup and skincare routine. "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Mediocre ,I have a combination skin type. Got it as I thought Aloe Vera will be good for my skin. It is quite a big bottle so I think I can use it for awhile. No smell nor any stinging feeling. Feel like plain water like the other reviewers mentioned. But I believe it's still good as it's always better for toners to be fragrance free right?
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,recommend for sensitive skin,"Bought this for my brother. From, his review, he said that this toner is  too gentle and it doesn't really clean the skin well. However, it is very refreshing and soothing. He thinks that it is better for sensitive skin!"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Mild toner,"I have mildly sensitive skin and this doesn't irritate my skin. However, the texture of this toner is very watery, and I usually have to pour quite an amount on my cotton pad before I feel that I am cleaning my face properly. Hence my toner uses up really quickly. Also, I feel that it might be a little too mild and it doesn't give me an extremely refreshing feeling after I use it. I think this should be suitable for people with more sensitive skin. "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Simply amazing,"I've really noticed the difference. Even the people around me says that my complexion has gotten brighter. For the past few days, I've stopped using it because I don't have the time as I'm always rushing for school & I've noticed that my face has gotten back to the way it was (dull & lifeless :c) & i want to get back to the routine of using it again! Overall, amazing product! "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,soothing effect,"a decent toner with soothing effect. When I have minor sunburn, I used it as a mask, the burn is relieved quite immediately. But I think it can be cheaper compared to the effect it delivers. Another thing I like about this toner is fragrant-free and paraben-free. "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Great ,"Heard great things about the Mario Badescu brand, and I'm so glad I found this toner! Very gentle for my skin, and it doesn't cause any break outs on my acne prone/sensitive skin. Perfect for daily use and my skin loves it. "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Great!,"This toner is simple and effective, it feels refreshing on my skin without making it feels dry. I do not like any cleansing products that has fragrance to it, and this is a great choice if you are looking for a mild toner!"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Good enough,I like this toner because it is very mind and gentle. But I dont really feel that my skin is being deep cleaned with this toner. This might be so because I have normal skin. This product will be best suited for people with dry skin. 
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,VERY GOOD,"I have very very sensitive skin + eczema problems (sometimes). I read up somewhere that aloe vera and a non-alcohol product will be good for my skin and thank god, i found both of it in this one fabulous toner. I definitely would recommend this for problem skin girls who just need something to soothe their irritated and sensitive skin. :)"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,in love with it!,"after i use this product, my skin get so much better. whenver i apply it i feel refreshed. i love it. i will not change my product skincare anymore. i will stick with mario bedascu. thank you mario bedacsu, thank you luxola"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Aloe Vera Toner 236ml,"This toner is great for my face. I have oily and sensitive skin, and this toner is gentle and leaves no stinging sensation on my face at all. My face also feels and looks cleaner after using this toner twice a day! I will definitely continue using this product. "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Aloe Vera Toner,"This is my first time using Mario Badescu, and it went really well. I started with the Aloe Vera Toner as  it was the safest, a mild and non drying toner. And it was really soothing on my sensitive skin, there wasn't any redness after using it. Would definitely recommend it for people with hyper sensitive skin who are prone to flare ups if their toner is too harsh"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Gentle Toner,"I did not have the habit of using toner but after purchasing this toner, I started to use toner everyday. It is a gentle toner which leaves the skin feeling clean, toned and refreshed. Will definitely continue using this toner!"
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Awesome,first time ever writing a review and puchasing Mario Badescu products! Now i understand why everyone is raving about these products. Its so gentle and exfoliate my skins well :) the best toner i ever used! No stingy feeling at all !! 
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Expected more,"This was an average toner for me probably because it's too gentle for my skin. I applied it to a cotton pad and wiped my face, but the cotton pad collected no dirt. When I did the same with another toner, the cotton pad picked up dirt. This might be suitable for those with sensitive skin."
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Not for me...,"This toner did nothing for me. It does not pick up any leftover dirt or dead skin cells after I've cleansed my face. It felt like I have just applied water to my skin. My face did not feel ""toned"". Definitely not gonna purchase it again. I have  since thrown it away."
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Aloe Vera Toner,"This toner is very light with nice scent. Moreover, it does not dry up your skin (especially those with strong alcohol toner). I have been using this for awhile and it works well on my skin. I used this twice daily."
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Toner,"Not a really impressive toner from Mario badescu. It did sooth my face but the clearing effect using a cotton pad is not that strong compare to my other toner, but it did the hydration job pretty well. "
MARIO BADESCU-Aloe Vera Toner,,Aloe vera toner,"I think it works just fine, nothing too fascinating or any wowing factor. Just a light and calm toner that doesn't irritate the skin. Good if you have sensitive skin. I use this every morning. No smell too which is good i guess!"

FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Australia,decent ,"idk man i like the honeymoon serum but i feel like this toner didn’t do much for me in terms of skincare. like it was a decent toner but i feel like it didn’t make my skin feel smoother or softer, didn’t make a difference with redness, pores, or acne. "

FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,BUY IT,"Feels great but it does dry out my skin, so facial oils after using this toner is a MUST. ALTHOUGH this toner does a great job removing excess dirt and leftover makeup even after my cleansing routine. My boyfriend who has sensitive and oily skin, also uses this product everyday and feels no tingly sensations. It’s cleared both our acne blemishes and continues to help us have cleaner and softer looking skin."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Not impressed,Meh. This is just okay. I have to go over my skin and use twice as much product as other exfoliating toners to see even half as much difference. I love a clean beauty option but in this case I’ll stick with my REN and Summer Fridays AHA exfoliating toners.

FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,Holy grail toner!!!!,"This toner is what made me fall in love with Farmacy. I have only ever encountered 2 toners: toners that burned my face off or toners that did nothing while irritating my face due to fragrance. I have sensitive, acne prone and combo skin. This toner makes my face feel so UNBELIEVABLY clean and soft and yet has magically not dried my skin out at all. I’ve seen a radical improvement in no more whiteheads along my chin and jawline which has been my problem for literally months. This will never leave my routine!!!!!"

FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,Works well but pricey,Been using consistently for the past year and it has kept my acne away aside from the one pimple around that time of the month. Recently emptied my fourth bottle and stopped using it for a month and started breaking out again. Hoping to find a cheaper alternative.

FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,My ride or die toner,"Lost count with how many times I've repurchased this. My skin loves it. As a Canadian I was tired of ordering across the border for the Paula's Choice BHA toner and this is just as good - actually, it's better. It's obvious when I don't use it - my skin stays so much clearer when using. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Favourite Farmacy product."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Think Paula’s Choice with Added Papaya and Scent,"The DEEP SWEEP toner Exfoliates + deep cleans pores with a 2% BHA (salicylic acid) + papaya enzymes. The papaya enzymes gently exfoliate and deep clean to minimize the look of pores, revealing a healthy-looking complexion.

I love this toner and think of it as a great gentle exfoliant. I personally use it as an exfoliant in my routine. It’s reminiscent of Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant (which I also love), but the FARMACY’s toner adds the Papaya Enzyme along with an amazingly refreshing scent.   Please note that though this product has a fresh scent to it, there is no synthetic fragrance added."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Singapore,Pretty good toner,One of my favourite toners in the rotation now. Decent AHA/BHA.

FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Australia,refreshing ,"This is so refreshing and doesn’t leave a sticky residue like some other toners. It helps with my large pores and oil control. I would definitely continue to buy it, but it’s been discontinued in my country "
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,Love it! I use it every morning before moisturizer.
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,Gentle but still effective,"I tried other alcohol free toners before, but I found them to be too gentle and did not tone my face well enough. This product however has the best balance of the two for my skin!"
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,too strong,"This product was way too strong and I don’t have sensitive skin. It broke me out and didn’t do anything for my skin. I know it was the cause of my breakouts because it was the only new thing I introduced to my routing and when I went back to my usual toner, my skin went back to normal. I usually love farmacy products but this one is a fail for me."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Malaysia,Love it!,"I love it! However, don't expext miracles like a noticable difference to the size of your pores. It does the job and seems that it is more 'natural' to the skin."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,"I’m now on my 3rd bottle so I feel like it’s safe to say this product is AMAZING! I love this toner. It’s not harsh in stripping, it gets the gunk out and my skin has never looked better!  I use it AM and PM and I just love!"
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Malaysia,Gentle ,So far this toner is doing a great job which is it does not irritate my skin. This is the one and only toner that has a very light scent ive ever tried. Almost no scent at all and really light in texture suitable for those with sensitive skin. 
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,"I bought the mini size and used it for about 6 weeks, I love other Farmacy products and had high hopes. Ultimately, though, I didn’t like this one. It never felt like it fully absorbed into my skin and always left a tacky, greasy residue. I didn’t see any improvement in my pores or texture, but did see an uptick in monthly hormonal zits. Before this I was using Glow Recipe’s watermelon toner religiously for over a year, but I wanted to try something new. I’ve since switched back to the GR and my skin already looks and feels better.

Also, the smell is horrific. At first I barely noticed it and it didn’t bother me, but it got to the point where I dreaded putting this on my face. I’m super sensitive to scents though."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,"Absolutely love it. I got the mini size and was pleasantly surprised at the amount you get and the fact that the mini also has glass packaging like the full size. I’m so glad I took the plunge and bought this. My pores are smaller, my skin is more even, and it feels refreshing to apply. It has a “barely there scent” which is great as fragrances don’t usually agree with my reactive skin. 100% recommend."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Malaysia,Gentle Exfoliating Toner,"I had never used an exfoliating toner before so after reading some reviews, decided to try this. The first time I used it, I didn't think that it was effective.  There was no tingle on my skin so I thought that it didn't work..I used to think that there needed to be a tingling sensation for any product to work! Anyway after using it for a little more than a week, I noticed that my skin was softer, smoother and the pores looked smaller. I guessed it is one of those slow and steady products. I really liked this and would recommend this to anyone looking for a gentle yet effective chemical exfoliant..as well as those who are first timers to the world of chemical exfoliants."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,Can't live without,"After using this toner for many years now, I truly believe this toner has single handedly improved my skin. Growing up I always had pretty large pores around my nose especially, and breakouts often in my t-zone. Using this toner has decreased the amount of breakouts I have on my skin significantly and its helped with absorption of other products so well. Now I wouldn't really consider my skin oily anymore, its gone to become more of a normal leaning dry, but I don't mind that now since my skincare routine is more geared towards nourishing my skin rather than trying to strip it all of it oils."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,"I’ve tried so many different toners, I first bought the mini size and panic bought the full size when I realized the bottle was empty. It is gentle on my skin but works perfectly! I’ll never use another toner"
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,it maintained my skin the way it was,"I put three stars cuz it didn’t do anything to my skin but didn’t do anything bad to my either. It maintained my skin the way it was , it smells really good and I like the glass bottle but I honestly don’t know what it did for me. The Paula’s choice one is still winning to me."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,"I'm not crazy about most toners, but this one is the exception.  I like to use it in the morning and it really helps my skin look fresh and clean without stripping it."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Gentle!,"This is not spectacular, but it does do what it advertises! It is definitely gentle enough to be used daily, and it makes my face a bit smoother and softer after use. My acne has been helped with this too! I still have a bit of congestion, but it’s a bit better. I give 5 stars not due to it blowing me out of the water, but it doing what it says at a decent price point. Lasts a long time, and my dry/dehydrated skin handles this well :)"
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,perfect!,"I love this toner, Just purchased my second bottle and I'm obsessed. It's almost as effective as the peace-out salicylic serum but with a better texture for using under makeup!"
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,No change in pore size,"I have combo skin with hormonal acne flares and large pores. The bad: I have used this toner in the morning for the past 2-3 weeks and have seen no change in the appearance of my pores. My acne this week is the worst it’s been in years, so perhaps this product does not work well with my skin or with the other products I use (I apply trentinoin at night). The good: love the glass bottle and the refreshing light feel of this toner. I wanted to try a clean ingredient option and this fit the bill. I just wish it provided results! Will not be a repurchase, and I may give up trying if my acne continues to worsen."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,Best toner hands down. You really do see the pores minimized after a few days of using. They should produce a larger size bottle.
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Singapore,not bad ,"Feels good using it, no allergy or breakout. Heavy bottle, too bad no refill. Might repurchase if on sale. Rather effective in controlling my acne if I use it with soothing product with nicinamide "
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,Loved it! Skin feels refreshed and hydrated right away. Ready to order my third bottle.
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,Obsessed with this brand including this toner. It is incredible and smoothes out your skin like crazy. I've already gone through two bottles over the past few months
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,"I love this product! Definitely my go to! I have combo, sensitive, acne prone skin and this clears it up so well. I’m super sensitive to things and I had no reaction. Smells good, easy to use, love the slight tingle, nice glass bottle, and LOVE the results! My pores look so much smaller. I will continue to repurchase this product!"
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,"LOVE LOVE LOVE. I have problematic skin (uneven tone/texture, large pores etc.) My favorite way to use this is on an exfoliating cotton pad. The stuff it sloughs off is unreal. It leaves my skin feeling tighter, firmer, cleaner, and smoother. Will definitely continue to buy."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,Goodies!,just the fact that there was a little sample inside as a bonus give it the merit of 5 stars. so excited to try this!
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,"This toner helped my skin recover from pretty bad acne. I have a much better complexion! It doesn't burn your face and has a very light, pleasant fragrance which doesn't irritate the skin."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,This toner makes me feel so clean and refreshed after each use! I have noticed my skin looking more vibrant. I like to change products once I’m done with them but I don’t think I’ll change this product in my skin care routine.
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,not harsh on skin,Feels nice but I’m pretty sure this made my pores bigger. Definitely did not improve anything about my face.
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,Easily my favorite Farmacy product. It's so gentle but does such a great job. I switch between this and the exfoliating toner from Paula's Choice. This one is my favorite of the two. And I love that it comes in glass rather than plastic.
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,Recommend,Amazing toner that cleans popes fast and noticeably minimizes pops too! I totally recommend this product.
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,not for me,Pass. Didn’t do anything for my skin and didn’t see a difference with daily use.
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Broke out skin,The toner broke out my skin on the cheek area. I was hoping it would help my pores but just made my cheeks look like a battle field of red bumps. Does not work for me but could work for you. I would definitely try a sample first before buying the whole product.
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,"I’m obsessed!!! Currently on my 3rd bottle, will probably repurchase for the rest of my life. 
I have extremely sensitive skin, a lot of toners are too harsh or cause me to break out in a rash - this stuff on the other hand is like a miracle liquid. I struggle with acne and rosacea, and while I don’t see a difference in the redness on my face, I do see a difference in my pores/texture. I wish this came in a jumbo size!!"
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,"so refreshing and light on the skin, definitely recommend"

I saw a noticeable difference in two days- and now I'm never going back. my skin looks brighter, clearer and it was so easy to introduce into my routine"
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,the rare toner that worked for my skin so far,"acne prone, oily and sensitive skin here. i’ve restocked this toner for many many times since discovering it in 2020 and it’s the only toner i used now. it’s not rocket science and won’t clear up your skin in a day or two, but might help with clogged pores and acne a lot over time (it did for me!). i love how it contains active ingredients yet still gentle on my sensitive skin and has never broken me out. definitely 5 stars!"
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,Love this product! Helps prevent breakouts esp from mask wearing and doesn’t dry out my skin at all!

FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,"I like this but I’m not sure it does anything for my skin. I’ve been using it for about a month and haven’t noticed much, but it definitely hasn’t made anything worse. I’ll finish up the bottle before I decide if this gets a permanent spot in my routine."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,GET IT.,"I have dry skin with some minor pimples and somewhat large pores.... this toner is incredible. It doesn't dry out my skin, it doesn't cause me to break out. In fact, when I use it, my pimples seem to disappear faster than if I hadn't used it. Doesn't smell bad either... would definitely recommend :)"
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,YES to smooth skin!,"I use it at night after cleansing. I don’t have acne or any blemishes luckily (I will break out if I don’t wash my face), I use this as an anti aging component. My skin looks smooth and bright the next morning. WAY better than the Paula’s Choice BHA toner, which I liked too."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,fresh feel and deep clean,The formula feels fresh and gives me a deep clean.
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 50ml,"Wanted to love but it was too harsh for my dry and sensitive skin, definitely would suit someone who is on the oilier side."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 50ml,"Prior to being this product, I was a bit unsure about investing in this product because of the reviews. I love the Farmacy brand, however, I was just so unsure about this product. Nevertheless, I was looking for a good toner, and decided to give this one a shot during the spring sale. Surprisingly, I actually really liked this product. I have always struggled with acne prone skin, and this product is a life saver. I use it in the morning and now that it’s a part of my skin care routine, there’s no going back. I also find that compared to many other products the brand makes, the price point is fairly decent."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,Gentle but effective. One of my favorite Farmacy products
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,amazing,Absolutely love this toner. Saw a difference in my skin away and even got compliments from coworkers on my skin!
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Not a success story for me,Broke my skin barrier after one use. I tried to give it another shot and the same thing happened. Also broke my face out immensely & I don’t break out often. I use BHA from other companies and don’t have this issue. I wouldn’t recommend this for sensitive skin.
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,A staple in my skin routine!,"Love the formula, the packaging. I have repurchased this product 3 times because after the first time my skin has been getting much better. Pores are smaller, when I get breakouts, the toner really helps blemishes disappear faster. There’s no tight feeling or stinging when product is applied"
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Might pill,"Overall, this product is effective. After a few days of use, I noticed that my pores appeared to be smaller and I had fewer blackheads. The only problem I found with this product was that I noticed my makeup would pill if I implemented this product in my AM routine. At first I wasn’t sure if it was this toner or the sunscreen I was using, but when I stopped using this toner (finished the product) I realized my makeup no longer pilled. This toner is good to use in your night routine. Not 100% sure if it’s worth it considering it pills. If I could, I would rate this product 3.5 stars."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,❤️,Very mild toner but work pretty well! Didn’t dry out my sensitive skin.
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Love,Love this toner no strong scents and surprisingly it does not dry out my skin nor does it burn
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,Canada,Farmacy Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner - 120ml,"I’ve never used toner. I used to work for Dermatologist and have use Cetaphil for years. I recently switched to the Clearly Clean balm by Farmacy and just started applying this afterwards as part of my nighttime regimen. My face was so shiny but not tight afterwards. Didn’t dry my skin out. I would buy again and again..
For a Clean beauty line, Farmacy is a good one that is suited for dry, oily and also sensitive skin like mine."
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,Gentle Toner,"I think I like this so far, i’ve only used it three times since I am unsure how often to use it. I like the light scent of it, I like the texture, haven’t seen huge changes yet but its only been a few days. I have sensitive skin and this didn’t irritate my skin!"
FARMACY-Deep Sweep 2% BHA Pore Refining Toner,USA,10/10,"First off, this toner is seriously sensitive skin friendly. I also feel because I mention that first some might think it’s not as strong, but it IS.
Sometimes it’s hard to find a product that isn’t irritating but does the job.. and this is it! Swipe over cleansed skin with a cotton round once a day and it’s wonderfully smoothing and clears pores."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,New Zealand,Affordable toner ,"Smells pleasant, nice and refreshing on the skin and not irritating. Don’t know if it does much, but least it doesn’t break me out or anything. Feel like it’s a better product for younger skin?

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,Australia,didn’t suit me,i have acne prone skin and it didn’t break me out.But I didn’t see any difference.I was looking for a toner which can minimised pores.it didn’t helped me.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,Australia,Average,"I was expecting brightening effect, but did not find any change in my skin.. A little good effect at the moment. Not so satisfied. But gonna try something different sephora
"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,New Zealand,strong scent ,This product feels great when applied refreshing and leaves no sticky or tacky residue. My only issue with this is the scent is very strong and I avoid this on my face where possible. Dispite that it does smell nice so if you like scent on face products definitely a good deal
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,Australia,soothing and refreshing,"Smells delicious. I added this to my routine and like how it smells and makes my skin feel fresh and smooth. My pores are smaller and the redness on my cheeks and around my nose seems to be fading. a more even skin tone and blurred pores is the outcome, although I do mix with a balancing tonic from Sephora and an exfoliating tonic from Alpha-H but this adds to the deliciousness of my routine because of the beautiful fresh passion fruit scent. at this price, I recommend and will be buying it when I run out. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,Singapore,Not bad,"I use this in the morning for a bit of a pick me up haha.
Love! Doesn't sting my very sensitive face and doesn't break me out. I use 4-5 drops for my entire face using a cotton pad and then put on my moisturiser and sunscreen. Not sure if it really has any brightening properties."

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,Singapore,Smaller than I thought,"I was expecting the bottle to be slightly larger, when it came I was a bit surprised at the size (about the height of a credit card, sans cap). It smells nice, I typically shake a few drops and pat on my face."

I would highly recommend this product"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,Canada,First step in my mourning routine!,"I ADORE this tonic, I use it as my first step when I do my morning skincare routine at my boyfriends.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,Canada,Buy this right now trust me!!!!,"I actually got the passion fruit vitamin C bottle. It works wonders! I’ve only been using it for about a week and it got rid of my under eye bags and makes my skin glow. I use cerave face wash, then apply this to my face using a cotton pad, then add some of the ordinary serum and lastly use the cerave moisturizer. My skin is the best it’s ever been and I feel great!"

Definitely love it, this is my second time purchasing it (I got the pink bottle last time) and will continue to do so. And at 6 bucks? Definitely can’t beat the price."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,Canada,a little goes a long way!,This does an amazing job in the morning. Hydrates and keeps it ready for moisturizer and sunscreen.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,USA,Sephora Collection Vitamin Tonic Lotion - Dragonfruit,In my opinion this product smells soooo good and I love the way that it leaves my skin. =)
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,Canada,I thought it was a sample,I am sorry I thought they sent me a sample size. This is useless I will have to buy one every 2 weeks if it lasts that long. Not even going to try it I do not have time to run out for toner every week or 2.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,Singapore,Refreshing,I got this on an impulse buy to get points but damnnn this baby really came thru. Super love how clean my skin feels after applying this and how u can really see all the dirt come off. It smells really refreshing too. My new fave tonic lotion
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,Australia,amazing,So I use this after I take make up off and also before I apply make up. the smell is great and doesn't have an oily texture. I highly recommend this product 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,USA,nice toner,It is good for sensitive skin. Does not burn at all. The bottle is little small for the price.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,USA,Good dupe for cucumber micellar milk water!,"I personally used to use the cucumber micellar milk water that they used to have and I will say in my experience with this product, it’s very similar and a good dupe for the discontinued micellar water."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,USA,GREAT FOR TRAVEL!,It’s the perfect price and perfect size for traveling! I brought the B3 to destine Florida and it was everything I needed for my skincare!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,USA,Sephora Collection Vitamin Tonic Lotion - Dragonfruit,"Tiny bottle!  It’s sized more like a deluxe sample, but my fault for not noticing the ounces before I ordered. Smells delicious, spot on passion fruit scent! I used for the first time today but as far as I can tell, it’s fab! I am using Inkey List Vitamin C serum and it has taken away the age spots on my face so I am using this in conjunction."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,USA,C & E,"Love it! Feels great on my skin after washing.
I use the C in the AM and the E at PM and follow with my fave moisturizer."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,USA,"Evens the skin, affordable, does the job well !","I use in the morning after washing my face. I love it and I have seen impact visible impact it has had with 3 weeks of use. I had some acne marks and the only addition to my routine was this Vitamin C tonic lotion, the scars are less visible now"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,New Zealand,Enjoyable to use,"Very cute little bottle, very nice and fruity smell too not empowering. I like to leave the bottle in the fridge for a nice cooling effect, it does feel very good on the skin after cleaning it. However, haven’t noticed any particular effect on my skin. Maybe slightly brighter? Still enjoyable to use."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,Australia,Basic and cute,Nothing special but smells nice. Cheap enough to try out. I haven't noticed a difference  but also haven't had a reaction. might try it on my body to see if it makes a difference
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,Australia,Smells great,"Smells sweet like lollies but doesn't last long. I don't think this does anything. I've used it for a couple weeks and didn't notice when I stopped. 
might try it on my neck or one arm to see if I notice any difference"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,Australia,3 out of 5,"I've used this for awhile and while it smells nice, like lolly water but not too strong or overpowering, I haven't noticed any lasting effects. My skin feels softer and hydrated at the time "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,Singapore,a tad to overpowering for me ,"I love how nifty the bottle is and it’s pretty. I had high hopes for this given the good reviews. However, I found the scent a little too overpowering and I think the formula may be too strong for my skin. I experienced some itch and have since stopped using it. This may not be an indication that this is not a good product, it could just be my skin. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Vitamin Tonic Lotion,Australia,Nice product,does what it says it does and provides a sheild from pollutions in the air smells nice also then again I love Dragonfruit and Custard Apples. The bottle is a small handy design
NUDESTIX-5% Citrus Fruit & Glycolic Glow Toner,New Zealand,Finally a toner that hydrates my skin! ,I have shopped around so many toners over the years from cheap to super expensive and I am going to finally settle on this one. It does such a fabulous job of both hydrating and clearing skin. My skin is so much more glowy and plump using this than other toners I have tried and it really makes your skin feel nice. 
NUDESTIX-5% Citrus Fruit & Glycolic Glow Toner,Singapore,toner,"It's jam-packed with hyaluronic acid to hydrate, but in a lighter toner formulation that can be easily layered under your other products. great for its moisturizing properties and versatility!!!!"
NUDESTIX-5% Citrus Fruit & Glycolic Glow Toner,Malaysia,HOLY GRAIL!,I can’t rave about this enough!!!! It is the best. My skin brightened up and became less dull within just days of usage. I use it 2-3 times a week and that’s more than enough. 
NUDESTIX-5% Citrus Fruit & Glycolic Glow Toner,Singapore,great,Saw it on sale and decided to try it. It was alright and smells good. I do like that the bottle had a press pump and that made it so easy to use with a cotton pad. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Singapore,toner,I have used it once and am in totally love with it. I bought this after the suggestion from one of my frnds...and it works well with my skin. I use it daily and my skin has become so smooth..will buy it again. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Australia,just okay,Just alright and normal toner. Nothing bad but nothing great. I feel that Sephora range doesn’t work it’s magic fast and doesn’t have fast results. Got it on sale so don’t regret buying it. Wouldn’t repurchase it again….
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,New Zealand,Ms,"To be honest, I don’t really like the fragrance of the toner, it smells like plastic things. It’s moisturising enough which is good, but I use it only at night as I prefer a lighter one in the morning."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,New Zealand,Nice,The sephora products are my one of the fav products.  The range is unbelievable. Looking forward for more deals and mini gift sets. Very exicfed for my next purchase. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Singapore,First time using toner,The toner definitely helped clean my skin as I can see it taking off extra dirt even after a double cleanse. I am not sure that it helped with anything else and I used it very quickly. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Malaysia,Feels good on the skin,Been using it and I have noticed that my skin is getting smoother when I use it consistently. I love how it work on my skin. I love the sephora collection overall.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Singapore,ehhh,"I don’t know if it’s this product that’s helping but I’ve been applying this before all the serums and acids on my face and it tends to absorb quicker. Maybe it’s this, maybe it’s not. I can’t tell. but I hate the smell for this, smells like saliva. Like applying saliva all over your face. Feels very yucky but luckily the smell gone in 30-50 secs. Skin still gets oily after using. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Singapore,good!,got this toner at a great price (Sephora NZ was having sales!) and it works well! first time trying out Sephora toner and hopefully it will continue to do good for my skin!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Malaysia,Nurjahan,It suits me a lot. I really loved this item

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Australia,Great feel ,"Has a subtle scent, nothing too strong. Feels light and fresh on my skin without drying it out. Good product 👌 i definitely recommend trying this if you haven't already "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Australia,lovely balancing tonic,for the price I love this. I mix with Sephora brand vitamin C tonic and Alpha-H tonic to refresh my skin after cleansing. it works well to take away the tight feeling on my skin and reduces the appearance of pores. my skin is clarified and perfectly ready for serums and moisturiser. would recommend 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Canada,Sephora Collection Gentle PH Balancing Toner - 200ml (Original),"I’m not really enjoying this. Been noticing that my skin, especially on my cheeks, has been feeling more sensitive lately since I started using this."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Singapore,love this,"I love using this toner, very refreshing on skin. I use it right after cleansing and before essence. My bottle is almost finish and will likely repurchase. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Singapore,S+ Gentle Ph Balancing Toner,"Good basic toner
I am just in need of a good basic toner and this fits the bill. It does sometimes tingle but that goes away really quickly. I have noticed my skin is smoother when I use this consistently.  I love the sephora collection, I can always buy good stuff even on a budget."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Malaysia,Great toner,"This is a great toner. Leaves your skin feeling amazingly refreshed and gives it a healthy glow. It is very gentle on the skin... It hydrates, smooths, and evens out the look of your complexion."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,USA,Great Hydrating Toner,Loved this. Sort of a thickish gel texture and I think it gave some hydration and PH balance after exfoliating at night. I’d buy again. I also use the Thayers toners and this had a comparable effect.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,New Zealand,works well,Sephora branded skincare products are amazing. I use this toner after cleansing and it has helped keep my face feeling clean and looking more healthier! 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Malaysia,Clean and smooth ,Love it. Works well on my skin and doesn’t dry me out. Clean and feel smooth. Will repurchase.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Malaysia,Nice ,I use this as my skincare routine and what can i say is.. this toner really helps my skin 🤍 you should try it if you have combination skin bcs it rly works well on me! 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Canada,Sephora Collection Gentle PH Balancing Toner - 200ml (Original),Just finished my first bottle and I love it. My skin feels more smooth. I have dry skin (and ezcema) and it's very gentle. I recommend it !
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Canada,Good Toner,Had effect after the first use. Has a nice feel on the skin. Wished it didnt have perfum.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Malaysia,Good,"My son is using this as his day time skincare routine. It is good coz it is gentle yet effective against pimples. As with all skincare, you kuat use it everyday. Value for money!"

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,USA,Sephora Collection Gentle PH Balancing Toner,"I enjoyed this Gentle PH Balancing toner, it kept my skin fresh and smooth."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Australia,toner ,I was impressed by the size of the product it’s much bigger than what I was expecting. It worth the price and it’s good quality. It makes my skin amazing. I recommend it product 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Canada,"Great Toner, Perfect for Mask Acne","So far, I really like this toner! A PH balancing toner is perfect if you’re getting acne from wearing a mask all day, so if that’s something you’re struggling with, I’d definitely try this out. I don’t love the smell and it isn’t revolutionary, just your basic toner, but it does leave your skin smooth and the price is great for a basic, day-to-day toner."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,USA,Excellent facial toner!,This works well the Sephora Triple cleanser. I am able to have a cleaning routine that helps my face stay clean and my pores stay open after I use my makeup.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Australia,Felt nice to put on but didn't do anything,This item was what you could call unnecessary step for my skincare routine it felt nice but when you don't have a very long attention span and skip steps in your skincare routine all the time it will not make a difference
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Singapore,mz,Not too bad a product. House brand is okay ! Recommend. Is not fragrance free. First timer Can consider buying this product with ease. Double “cleanse” my face after washing with facial soap. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Singapore,Great 👍 ,"Basic toner, nothing much to say about it. I used it with the rest of Sephora skincare. Gentle on the skin as advertised.

200ml goes a long way. No fragrance, doesn't feel Oily as I have Oily skin. 

Will I buy it again? I don't know, for the price maybe. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,USA,Sephora Collection Gentle PH Balancing Toner - 200ml (Original),"Got this for my daughter in hopes of finding a more budget-friendly option! (You know how teens go through stuff so quickly) :|
She actually liked it and has asked for mama to get her more! She did say it did help her skin stay clear and when her bottle got stolen (car broken into, gym bag stolen), she’s noticed a difference not using it."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Canada,basic toner,It’s okay not terrible but not exceptionally good either. I usually use it on days I can’t use my glow tonic toner so I don’t end up mixing products that I can’t mix.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,USA,Sephora Collection Gentle PH Balancing Toner - 200ml (Original),"I absolutely love this product. Love the smell!! 
Leaves my skin very soft."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,USA,Sephora Collection Gentle PH Balancing Toner - 200ml (Original),Works  great  leave  my skin  clean without  dry  feeling
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Canada,good for oily skin,it`s a useful product... the skin remains soft and smooth after use.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,New Zealand,Nice,"I bought to alternate with a Glycolic Acid, so I was looking for something gentle, possibly soothing and with a low PH. It's nice, I use it in the morning. no stinging, feels nice. It's fairly strong scented, flowery, and so I can't use it too close to my eyes due to sensitivities to fragrance (my eyes will water all day.... ) but that's me, other products do it to me, too. 
Fair price, reasonable sized bottle, is what it says on the package. Will last a while. I would probably re purchase, if I don't come across something else to try in the mean time 😀 "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Singapore,Not bad at all,A very gentle toner that is suitable for most skin types even acne prone or sensitive skin. Does its job. Has a pleasant scent. Good that price is affordable
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Malaysia,Good,I read the reviews on this product and they were all good. So I thought why not give it a try? It is a reasonably-priced toner. Wish it could be in a 400ml bottle though.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Australia,great results ,"I feel this toner really refined my skin, didn’t dry out or cause irritation! It left my skin feeling fresh! Really nice packaging and product would recommend and use again "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Singapore,does the job ,"Its an affordable toner that does the job, feels nice after use. Definitely gentle on skin that does not leave any uncomfortable feelings or dryness. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Malaysia,too much astringent ingredient!,Would not repurchase as the toner was too astringent and harsh on my skin. There was constantly a stinging sensation after toning and I would have to constantly layer on a soothing/ hydrating toner post this. This item also spilt when Sephora sent it to me so 1/6th was missing due to bad packaging. Suggest to purchase in store if you want to test it out and ensure your bottle is not leaking.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Canada,Good basic toner,"I am just in need of a good basic toner and this fits the bill. It does sometimes tingle but that goes away really quickly. I have noticed my skin is smoother when I use this consistently.  I love the sephora collection, I can always buy good stuff even on a budget."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Canada,Sephora Collection Gentle PH Balancing Toner - 200ml (Original),"Doesn’t irritate my very sensitive/damaged skin, just wish there was a larger bottle."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,USA,It does the job!,"I like this toner.  It removes any traces of left over cleanser, and closes pores.  I was surprised when I read some of the reviews."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Canada,disappointing,really wanted to like this but it made my skin burn and gave me several breakouts.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,USA,Great toner for the $!,"I don’t understand the bad reviews on this toner. I switched to this from the Indie Lee toner: I ended up liking this much better and it’s far cheaper. It isn’t really sticky, like some of the other reviewers say, and it provides a nice platform for the rest of my skincare routine. My skin is calmer and smoother since I started using it. Very happy so far!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Singapore,best toner,"i have used quite a number of other type of toner but this one seems the best one of all...........
it suits for all types of skin....
this is my third purchase. 
confirm will repurchase. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,USA,not for me,"i thought i liked it at first. sadly, it gave me a breakout"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Malaysia,smells good,I love the scent and it size.. smells good and it takes my face dirt after application. Just use about 2 weeks and feels skin a bit soft!! I use with this range serum too btw. Hope better result cominggg!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,USA,Good toner!,"I like this toner a lot! It leaves my skin feeling fresh and hydrated, although I haven’t seen a major change in my skin since using it. I like the packaging with the squirt-bottle cap too, it’s easier to apply on a cotton pad than the kind you have to dab. Plus the price point is amazing!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Australia,love sephora collection skincare,I've been loving the new sephora collection skincare. I already use the serums and matte moisturiser. this is a nice toner but I haven't noticed much difference with my oily skin
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,USA,I like it,"So far so good. 
Leaves my skin clear and refreshed. 
I don’t like the way it smells but I’ll get over it as it works on my skin"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,USA,burning!,"I so wanted to like this because of the price point, but after one use it immediately made my face start getting red and burn! The burning went away after 10 minutes but it's just not worth it to me!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,USA,Sephora Collection Gentle PH Balancing Toner - 200ml (Original),Really nice simple toner skin felt clean and refreshed a little sticky but my routine after sinked in nicely
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Canada,Sticky,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I got a sample of this to see if I would like it. It left my skin so sticky!! I was really disappointed since it looked like it could be an amazing product.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Canada,This works!,"This toner is actually pretty great! Didnt expect much, but calms my red-ness on my skin and doesnt feel dry on the skin. My moisturizer also absorbs much easier after using this. There is a fragrance to it. It smells clean, slightly floral, however Id advise sensitive skin people to avoid!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Gentle PH Balancing Toner,Canada,Heavy perfume,"i tried to love this product but it dried me out really intensely. Its kind of my own fault as i didnt check the ingredients and perfume is really high up on the list. The smell is good, and for someone with more oily skin this may be more suitable but it was a miss for my combo skin  :("
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,Canada,great!,The only issue I have with this product is the bottle itself. It kind of sprays in an odd way. It would be better if it was a little more of a mist. Other than that great product with solid results.
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,Canada,I Like But I Don't Love,It adds a nice boost of hydration before other products and I really do enjoy that. Application is easy also and it works well with the rest of my routine. It isn't absolutely necessary though and I have no issue skipping this product a lot of the times. Like 90% of the times. But it is worth the purchase I just won't be getting another bottle any time soon.
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Amazing Toner,"Best toner, worked well on my combination skin
Would definitely recommend"
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Solid purchase!,"It’s a nice refreshing toner that doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I do feel it’s hydrating and it dries flat, meaning my skin isn’t left feeling sticky. My only wish is that the spray was finer, like a mist. The product is 5 stars, but the bottle brought my rating down to a four."
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,lifesaver!,"Absolutely love. Immediate calming results for my sensitive, red skin. Will definitely buy again and continue to use as part of my AM and PM skin care routine."
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,Canada,DERMALOGICA Multi-Active Toner,"Love this, my skin feels so good after and I like that it's a spray! I really don't regret buying this"
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,DERMALOGICA Multi-Active Toner,I was hesitant about this one but it’s actually really really good! Saw a difference instantly! Not sure why but I’m not a fan of the fact that it’s a spray
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,Canada,get it!,"It’s great, Dermalogica is amazing. I love the bubbly sounds after the spritz!"
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,harsh but good !,"Burns my face as soon as I spray it but no reaction or redness to it. I’m thinking it’s a little harsh for my skin, but definitely a staple in my skin care routine."
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,Canada,DERMALOGICA Multi-Active Toner,"initially bought this on a whim bc i liked how it came in a spray bottle. after using it for several months, i kinda really like it. when i first put it on, it stung a little but i got used to it. i like how it bubbles on your skin for a bit bc it feels like it’s really doing smth. then when it’s semi absorbed in, i follow with my essence and i noticed that it absorbed the essence so much better! i’m going to be ordering a second bottle"
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Don't buy online! Leaks!,"I love this toner. Great great great. Everything. Love. However, HEADS UP if you are ordering online, this doesn't ship well. I have had multiple leaking bottles. Half the product is gone by the time it arrives. Get a replacement... same thing happens. I wish they would either figure out the bottling so that it can be shipped OR carry it anywhere near me. So frustrating."
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,great toner.,"So I don’t spray this directly on my face, I spray it onto cotton. Not sure why, but I prefer that. I got this initially at a facial a few years ago and have really enjoyed it and keep repurchasing it. I’m not sure it’s actually doing what it’s supposed to, as I’m not sure what a toner is for, but I like it, so keep using it. The smell isn’t too strong and it dries quickly. It lasts a while as well."
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Perfect,"I absolutely love this toner and am so happy to have found it! I have always had issues with uneven SkinTone and splotchy redness. This has helped to even put my SkinTone so much. I couldn’t be happier! 
Gifted by Dermalogica"
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,Singapore,Favourite toner,"Have been buying this toner for years, it is so refreshing and feels so nice and light on your skin. I hate the sticky or oily feeling some products can leave on your skin but this doesn’t do that at all and gives you a little hydration boost. I use before and moisturising/doing my makeup and also at night after taking my makeup off. Love love love. "
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Not a fan,I am not a fan of this toner.  prefer not scented toners. The smell is kind of strong and it is full of citric oils. I am sorry I wanted to love it because the amount of product is great! It can last you a long time but I will keep looking. Gifted by Dermalogica for reviewing purposes but all opinions are my own.
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Love it!,"Really loving this toner gifted by Dermalogica! The spray bottle makes it easy to apply in the morning and it gently hydrates before I apply my HA, moisturizer, and sunscreen. My face has been nice and hydrated as we approach the winter months. I think this is a really great gift for someone who has dry skin, or also great for someone who goes to the gym a lot and could apply post-workout!"
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Love!,I have been looking for a toner to add to my skincare routine and I finally found it!  This product leaves my skin moist and soft. It really does help my moisturizer soak into my skin which I love especially going into the winter time!
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Good toner,Great toner! It has a lemon scent and feels on the skin! There is a spray applicator for the products and it applies evenly onto my skin. There is a slight foam reaction when you first spray the product to your skin but that quickly goes away as the toner sinks into your skin. This toner was gifted by Dermalogica for my honest review.
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Great toner!,Couldn’t wait to try this toner spray gifted by Dermalogica! I have very dehydrated skin and this spray is perfect for my skin! I spray it all over my face and neck after cleansing and before moisturizing. It immediately nourishes my skin. Also I use it through out the day when I feel I need a little extra hydration.
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,DERMALOGICA Multi-Active Toner,This was gifted to me by Dermalogica for a review. I always love using a toner or essence in my routine so I was really excited about this! I really enjoy the light and refreshing scent and it gives me that boost of hydration my skin needs. This layers really well with my other products. I especially love to use it before hyaluronic acid. I noticed the spray nozzle doesn’t distribute the mist as fine as I usually like but that’s not a deal breaker for me with how it preforms and how much you get!
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,DERMALOGICA Multi-Active Toner,"I love that Dermalogica’s Multi Active Toner comes in a spray bottle. The mist is fine and evenly distributes product all over your face, unlike many other toners which let out too much product. My skin feels super hydrated after using this, and I really like to spray this in the morning for a refreshing feel! This was gifted by Dermalogica."
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,DERMALOGICA Multi-Active Toner,"Gifted by Dermalogica. This is a nice addition to prep the skin before you go in with your serum and moisturizer, especially during the winter months. It is definitely more than a toner, and it feels better on the skin. That said, I wouldn't consider it necessary. It The mist is not very fine. It smells like lavender, which I find very calming, but that might be an issue if you're sensitive to essential oils."
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,great everyday toner,"this toner is a perfect option for something not too crazy strong or astringent. it's moisturizing and slightly heavier, so you really feel it on the skin until it dries. love it as a mid day refresh over makeup!"
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Great Toner!,"*gifted by Dermalogica* 
I’m used to toners that I can apply with a cotton pad, but this one says to just spray on the face. So I did. And I actually loved this. It has a wide spray so it gets your whole face with like 2 sprays! And I don’t know the best way to describe it, it’s like bubbly when it goes on the face. Super nice and hydrating! It’s a little wet, so I have to wipe my lips off before applying moisturizer! 
Ever since adding this toner into my routine I notice increased hydration. My hormonal acne is also so much better!"
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,DERMALOGICA Multi-Active Toner,I’m obsessed with this toner. I have a combination skin and this works great for me. It hydrates and keeps the skin looking smooth. It feels good and refreshing when I spray it. I totally recommend it. Complimentary from Dermalogica.
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,DERMALOGICA Multi-Active Toner,I was gifted by Dermalogica. I love that it has a spray bottle to apply it.  I love this brand so much!! It’s  such good brand for sensitive skin!!! I truly can trust this brand with my skin!! I would totally recommend it for anyone!!
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,DERMALOGICA Multi-Active Toner,"I really enjoy the fragrance of this toner, it’s not overly perfume-y. I also liked how it felt on the skin. It did sting a little though and was slightly sticky which I wasn’t a huge fan of. Overall though this a good product. I don’t know if it really did anything crazy for my skin, but it has good ingredients. I was gifted by Dermalogica but all opinions are my own."
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,So GOOD,I don't use toners often but I have been testing out the Multi Active Toner and I'm impressed. It has helped remove excess dirt and oil and my skin feels hydrated after using it! Gifted by Dermalogica.
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,DERMALOGICA Multi-Active Toner,"I’ve received this product complimentary from Dermalogica and have really enjoyed using it. At first, I thought this was just a refreshing spray but it’s definitely more potent than that. I use it both ways - before my main skincare, and also sometimes through the day on top of makeup. I love the idea of spraying toner instead of using stupid cotton pads. Right after application my skin feels a little tingly, but the sensation goes away very quick, leaving the skin feeling fresh and hydrated."
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,DERMALOGICA Multi-Active Toner,I like how easy the spray makes it to apply but what I really love is  how hydrating and refreshing makes my skin feels.  Everyone should have this in their skincare routine. Highly recommended this product.
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Works well,I keep seeing all these things online saying that toner is an unnecessary step in your skin care routine but I have to disagree. Toner is one of my favorite steps in my skin care routine because I have combination skin and I feel that toner preps my skin and helps absorb all the other products. Dermalogica kindly gifted me the multi active toner in exchange for my honest opinion. A classic white and gray bottle with a spray top. I really like that it has a spray nozzle because it makes the toner easy to apply all over my face and then press in to my skin without making too much of a mess like I do with the others. This toner has a mild citrus scent which I don’t mind and works well with my other skin care. I do prefer a toner with exfoliating properties though
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,DERMALOGICA Multi-Active Toner,"i have tried different toners however i feel like this one is my holy grail because is hydrating and love how easy is to apply, also how it feels on my skin and that it takes just a few seconds to absorb i definitely recommended"
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,DERMALOGICA Multi-Active Toner,Does not absorb as quickly as I want it to be. A bit too wet for my liking and not recommended for acne prone skin.

DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Love a good spray toner.,I have really been enjoying this toner. The bottle is a nice big size and having it be in spray form makes it so easy.

It’s very refreshing on the skin and leaves it feeling hydrated. I have enjoyed this so far. Gifted by Dermalogica
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,DERMALOGICA Multi-Active Toner,"I am obsessed with the fact that you feel it working as soon as it’s applied on your face. Its like a small suds effect which feels like it’s getting in every pore. It’s lightweight, refreshing, and it creates the perfect base for your daily serums and moisturizers. I use it everyday with vitamin c and their active moist moisturizer and it keeps my skin hydrated all day!"
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,DERMALOGICA Multi-Active Toner,"This product was gifted by Dermalogica. I was excited to try this because I love mists/toners in a spray bottle. However, I was underwhelmed because the nozzle doesn’t distribute the product evenly, leaving larger droplets on your face. While, that’s not a huge problem when I’m just applying my skincare, but it’s a problem if I have makeup on. I like using my mists/toners throughout the day, so this isn’t versatile enough to do that because this doesn’t have a fine enough mist."

To be quite franc, the Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner left me very pleased. The product is everything it claims to be. The spray applicator is very convenient to use, I don't need cotton pads anymore, it releases a fine mist; the formula is very light and delicate on the skin offering me much needed hydration and getting my skin ready for the next steps.

I need to use it longer to see long-term differences but my face definitely felt cleaner, healthier after using it."
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Great Toner,"Great toner if you have dry, sensitive skin. I typically avoid toners because they are either too drying or irritate my skin but this one is amazing! Adds extra hydration while brightening, reducing redness and soothing your face after morning washing. The bottle is large and well worth every penny!

I am absolutely adding this to my regimen, I just wish I had a purse sized spray to carry with me."
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Must have!,"First let me say, I love the idea of a spray toner. There’s something about a spray that’s so much more refreshing rather than swiping a cotton ball over your face. Not to mention less wasteful! The smell of this is out of this world. The mint element worried me, as I feel like that can be overwhelming in skincare. Not this one! It’s a delightful blend that smells like clear, clean skin! 10/10 recommended! 
This was gifted by Dermalogica"

This has quickly replaced my go to toners and I can see myself continuing to use this until it’s empty. Love!"
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Would recommend,"*gifted by Dermalogica 

The best thing about the Multi-Active toner by Dermalogica is that it comes in a spray form. The nozzle is perfect and let’s put a fine mist that covers the face evenly. My only issue is maybe I used a bit too much because I noticed that I started getting dry patches around my mouth but the rest of my favs was fine. It says to immediately follow up with a moisturizer so I did each time I used it. I would wake up with extremely hydrated and glowy skin but the skin around my mouth would be so dry. Not sure what that is about but nonetheless I would recommend this toner."
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Gentle tingling effectiveness,I’m VERY impressed with the quality of this toner. First off it has a divine scent that wreaks or freshness that’s not at all overpowering. The mist disperses in a way that drenches my face in its hydrating goodness! I love how gentle it is when it spritz’s across the entirety of my face. It feels like gentle bubbling tingles too which is so awesome because I’ve never felt anything like it!! Basically it spritzes into VERY light droplets that dissolve into the skin. My skin feels soooo hydrated and fresh after use. I really like how it makes my skin glow too. I love it and definitely need more! I don’t want to run out ever.
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,So hydrating!,Dermalogica gifted me this toner.Omg I love dermalogica products and this toner doesn’t disappoint at all!

I love using it at night to help prep & dampen my skin, so all of my products can really sink in! My skin hasn't been irritated in any way, & definitely love the hydration that mists provide. Not an ""essential"" step, but one I very much enjoy, especially when the products make me feel good like this! The mister doesn't dribble out or splat product out - it's a fine mist so it's very refreshing. While the price isn’t my favorite thing about this mist, you have to admit this is almost like a jumbo size mist compared to others!"

DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Deeply Hydrated Skin,"Dermalogica gifted me their Multi-Active Toner. The product is soothing for my dry skin and works well under makeup to leave my skin deeply hydrated. My only issue is the spritzer. It is very harsh and squirts out the product rather than misting it lightly. Besides from that, the toner is excellent. They just need to refine the spray nozzle on the packaging."
DERMALOGICA-Multi-Active Toner,USA,Refreshing and Hydrating,"This face mist is incredibly refreshing! It has a bright and light citrusy scent. It isn’t too strong or overwhelming and it disappears quite rapidly. The mist is fairly fine but quite strong so, you will get a good dousing of mist across your whole face. It’s immediately refreshing and hydrating! It really gives the skin an immediate boost of hydration and glow. I love to use it right before my serum because it helps my serums sink in better and seals in more hydration. The large bottle is so nice because it will last a really long time! I like sticking it in the fridge, it makes the mist even more refreshing! This mist really feels nourishing and the vitamins make my skin look and feel so healthy! It’s a great addition to any skincare routine but it’s especially great for dry and dehydrated skin, like mine. I can’t recommend it enough! Gifted by Dermalogica."

It is superior from your regular toner however in that it’s not harsh on the skin and does the effect of a lotion in that it doesn’t dry out the skin and leaves it feeling refreshed and moisturized. I highly recommend it and it has become one of my favourite products from this brand.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I use this as a toner. I use it with the Clé De Peau Beauté cotton. It leaves my skin feeling softer and refreshed. The scent is light and not too strong. I was worried that toners like this could irritate my dry sensitive skin, but it didn’t. This is probably my favourite out of all the Clé de Peau Beauté."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Overall good,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I am surprised with how hydrated and fresh my skin feels after this product. It is a light lotion and keeps the skin breathable. I don’t know why they call it lotion when it is so liquid. It does feel sticky at first so I used a cotton pad to apply to my face. Overall good product.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Skin benefits and clean feeling,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I feel like this product was made for me! There is something about how the consistency feels very hydrating and if anyone needs cell turn over it is me. I needed a product that can chase away that dead skin cells and show me a polished aftermath. I really enjoyed it and I think out of everything from this line it is my favourite!
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Less lotion more toner?,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It doesn’t have a strong scent which I’m very happy with. At first it felt sticky on my skin but after it was absorbed my skin felt bouncy. It’s very liquidy and feels more like a toner than a lotion. It also did not have any tingly feeling on my sensitive skin which is a huge win for me. My skin did not like it at first but it did feel more hydrated after. I would recommend this for more mature skin.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,I love it,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I got a sample size from influenster to test out, I love this product! very light toner, there is no irritations and is good for my skin type,  been using for 2 weeks and my skin feel soft right away when i use it. But don't see any benefits yet."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Hydrating but application can be tricky,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I was confused about this product as it claims to be a lotion but fits more in the toner category. It maintains a healthy skin barrier however I found using it with a cotton pad wastes a lot of the product. I applied directly in my hand and onto my face for this reason. Overall loved the product but cannot justify the price point.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Liquidy but hydrating,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This does what it says it does - it's a hydrating lotion. It's surprisingly very liquidy for a lotion but my skin was hydrated after use as it was intended to be. I did not feel any dryness after using it.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Lotion feels light which I like. Really moisturizing and makes skin feel good.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It is a luxurious and hydrating lotion. I applied it directly on my sensitive face, and it works well. However, it’s quite pricey, which this might be the only down side for this product."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This was way too liquid for my liking. I applied before my makeup and my makeup melted. So not the right product for me.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is very hydrating and does not strip away much natural moisture. I’m giving this 4 stars due to the price being high but if it was lower I would definitely purchase it.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Nice,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Giving this toner four stars because it was hydrating and does not strip away too much natural moisture. I have tried applying this with a cotton pad and it felt luxurious. If it wasn’t too expensive, I’d definitely get this toner."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Hydrating and clean!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I like it! I have extremely dry skin and I felt like it was refreshing to put on. I wasn't quite sure how I felt about the smell. Is it unscented? But it grew on me after a couple of uses. It felt hydrating and my dry skin thanked it after the extremely drying cleanser. I definitely would recommend, but it is slightly pricier than a majority of brands that I feel have the same results."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Two things I love about this:
1. Made my oily skin not as oily
2. Unscented
This is a 3rd step which seems a bit confusing as it’s labeled as lotion. Most lotions are final step to any skin regimen. But nevertheless, I would recommended it only if it’s a bit cheaper."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Not drying & left my skin feeling moisturized,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I did enjoy this lotion/toner as it left my skin feeling more moisturized & not tight feeling as most toners seem to do on my oily skin. Lightly scented & easy to apply.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Not a fan,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I didn't like the fact it was a liquid with no dropper or any way of putting it on my face then pouring it all over my hand. Also  there are no instructions on how to use products. No scent which was nice.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Pretty good as a lotion, went on easily and didn't feel too greasy after"
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Hydrating and gentle.,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Hydro-Clarifying Lotion is a mild toner that hydrates and does not leave the skin dry or rough. This is the third step in the skincare routine and honestly it has made my skin look so fresh and clean. Highly recommended.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It made my skin feel nice and soft. Feels nice on the skin. It kept my skin feel hydrated and smooths out my skin and gives me a nice glow.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Great product for clearing pores,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really like this product. I could feel and see a noticeable difference in my skin after using this product for a few days. It’s mild enough that my skin did not turn red or irritated after using it. I would get this product again.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Not really for a dry skin gal. This left my skin feeling tight and dehydrated, as well as the smell was very strong."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is the 3rd step and I don’t know if it’s necessarily needed but I suppose it aids in dryness.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I use this lotion as part of cle de peau's 4 step regimen. This is step 3 after applying the serum and I use it with the cotton pads for better skin absorption. Some lotions/toners have a “bite” to them where it dries out the skin a lot and does not feel supple. I did not get that feeling with this lotion.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Dried my skin,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) My face feel itchy it dried out my skin.I will not recommend this to oil skin.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I’m not one to use such a watery product in my skincare routine as my skin is on the dryer side and need extra hydration but this was not too shabby! It was nice to add to my regular routine but I dont feel like I need it. It feels a little tacky aside from that, its an okay product!"
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Mostly hydrating lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I was skeptical of this lotion at first as it’s a liquid, but I did find it to be quite hydrating. I did, however, find the area around my mouth because dry after a few hours"
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Lovely and light toner,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Firstly I am in love with the packaging (even though it is a small deluxe sample size). It has a very watery consistency for a toner which helps cool and soothe the skin and absorbs well. I applied it with my hands and pat it all over my face after cleansing. It did not leave any greasy or sticky residue and kept me feeling fresh and not dry. For reference I have extremely oily skin and this suited me well and did not break me out. #TheEmpowerOfThree #complimentary @Influenster
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Mediocre,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product I found to be just mediocre considering the price I expected it to be a lot better, magical, but it really wasn’t anything out of the ordinary. It was moisturizing and helped with some dryness, the scent was minimal which I appreciated."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product sounds really interesting but my skin was not happy. It felt incredibly dry afterwards and sticky as well. The smell is a bit much for me as well. I did use this with the cotton each time and I enjoyed the ritual of it. I’m not sure if it was my rosacea that was the issue but it did flare my skin up pretty bad so I had to stop using it.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,It's an ok toner/essence,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is actually more of a toner/essence than a lotion, I was initially so confused as I received a sample from Influenster so I had to check out the product online. For the price, I expected to be wowed a little more though."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I enjoyed how this product felt, especially when paired with the cotton from the same brand! The smell was a bit much for me however."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I do have oily skin, so I think this product worked really well for me! I love the texture of the lotion feels very hydrating on the skin"
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Great product,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this from influencer! Great lotion, it  can leaves my skin feeling refreshing and hydrated for the whole day! Easy to absorb into the skin, I would highly recommended this to my friends and family!"
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Hydrating toner,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This toner is very lightweight, refreshing and hydrating. It works great for my combo skin as it is hydrating for my cheeks while keeping my t zone in check."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Great for smoothing out skin,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is so effective for picking up any remaining impurities/dead skin left on your face. It felt very refreshing and gentle. I feel like it definitely helped smooth out my skin texture.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Great essence/toner,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It’s called a lotion but it’s a water toner essence type product. I really liked the texture on my skin, it’s not sticky and doesn’t dry your skin. It’s hydrating and a great step to add to your to routine before other lotion and cream. I think it did help prevent oiliness and dryness throughout the day!"
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is an amazing product! My skin feels soft and is well prepared for the next step in my skincare routine. It has a light and pleasant scent. Also helps clean any impurities that are left on the skin.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Amazing feeling skin,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this deluxe product as a free sample, I have totally fallen for this one.

This Lotion is more like a toner that dissolves dead skin cells and lifts impurities while instantly hydrating skin. It can be used in the morning and at night after serum. It’s extremely how my skin soaked it up. It  feels real light on the skin. Leaves my skin super soft and smooth with freshing feeling.  It doesn't cause any breakout or dryness. It has a very slight fragrance not irritating on just a bit sensitive skin like my own. It is a perfect first step after cleansing to brighten, moisturize and prep my skin for my other smoisturizers. I think it's making my other products work better. Overall, I really love Cle de Peau Beaute's skincare and makeup products that I have tried until now."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Great alcohol-free toner for combo/oily skin. It helps balancing my skin and hydrating the dry area, while not making other area oily."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,A drink for my skin,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It’s cool and refreshing. A great drink for my dry skin. Left my face so silky. 
Too bad they test on animals."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,beautiful texture.,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product somehow helped both my dry spots and helped reduce oils in my t zone area with out drying me out more or making me break out. It has a light, clean fragrance that feels luxurious with out smelling like perfume. This also helped hydrate my skin. I look forward to seeing long term results."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Clarifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) A light toner that absorbs easily. Smells luxe and a joy to use. Best of all, no alcohol!"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Glamglow SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,"The super mud mask is a must have product for me and part of my weekly skincare regime. Using a facial steamer then go in w/the mask, it gives me beautiful results. I’m 42 w/combo skin. Super mud mask cleans pores like k other and brightens/evens skin tone. It works so well for me I decided to try this toner and am so pleased with the results. The combo of acids does it for my skin!

GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,NO,"No. This was so drying and irritating. I just had a sample, and I was absolutely a no. Not worth the price, I wouldn’t even use it if it was free."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Malaysia,HG Toner,"I love this toner even despite the fact it has fragrance. Honestly, at the beginning, I was apprehensive since the fragrance is quite present but after numerous bottles of this, I love it, I look forward to starting off my skincare routine with this after washing my face. It helps keep my face clear. It is a strong acid toner so if you are starting out trying acids this is not the toner for you."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,amazing!!!,"Re purchased 3 times now, best toner on the market"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Glamglow SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,"The product worked great for the first two weeks dissapearing some pimples, after that, I started breaking out because it was too drying. The fragrance is also pretty strong but since my skin is not sensitive at all that was not an issue for me. After the breakout issue, I started using it as a spot treatment on the last step of my routine and worked great."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,MAGIC,Seriously loving this product!!! I see a difference in my skin after just a few uses. I feel like my skin is brighter and has a healthy glow. Not the best smell but ingredients do some magic on the skin. If you’re hesitating on buying this product… what are you waiting for?!

GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Singapore,super,one of the best toners I have used. Leaves skin clear and glowing. May tingle slightly. recommended
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Amazing for Hormonal Acne☻︎☻︎☻︎,I struggle with hormonal acne and recently had a terrible break out… I have always used the SUPERMUD mask and has done wonders for me… Because of how bad this breakout was I decided to add 2 more products from the same line: SUPERTONER & SUPERCLEANSE…And all I can say is thank you GlamGlow!!!! I have finally found the combination of products that actually deliver results!! I use the toner and cleanser twice a day and the mud mask at night… every morning my skin is looking better and better… the pics below can speak for themselves… best money ever spent!!!
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,best toner I've used in ages,"I used some points to try a mini sample on a whim and ended up buying it with the sale, I'm 41 but still have oily blemish prone skin and this toner feels amazing. I'm not a big review writer but if you have oily skin young or mature this toner makes your skin feel so fresh and smooth and tight! I love it, I usually bounce around when it comes to toners because as long as it helps clean out my pores I'm fine, I've used pixi clarifying river recently and it's nice but I'm fully hooked on this one 5 stars!"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Singapore,glowing skin,"Harsh at first but day by day my skin got used and feel it quite gooey nowadays, so would recommend even for sensitive skin like mine and despite the strong smell!"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,Skincare Staple,"Got this as a sample and then purchased it full size, now it’s a staple in my skincare routine! I usually use this toner first thing in the morning and find that it takes any extra dirt, oil or even extra makeup off my face and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed (for reference I have very oily skin). I usually just shake it up to activate it fully as per the instructions, put a small amount on a cotton pad, and swipe it along my face. I have also noticed that it I’ve had less small breakouts since starting it and don’t get as many little bumps underneath my skin. It’s a little on the pricey side, but well worth it if you are looking for a solid toner that can do it all. It also has a really nice light minty smell that is not offensive in the least."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Don’t do it,"This product made my skin worse. I have true combination skin. Gets flakey patches, but also pretty oily. I’m prone to cystic acne and blackheads. I’ve been using the tatcha line for about six months with great results. I completely got rid of my cystic acne with that line and had great tone and texture, however I still get a decent amount of blackheads. I still use the glamglow supermud mask to unclog my pores when I’m starting to notice a lot of blackheads, which is a holy grail for me. I was hoping this toner and serum would have a similar effect without having to sit with a mask on, just a time efficient part of my daily routine rather than weekly or biweekly mask. It did not do that. Immediately after I began using this it gave me some of the worst cystic acne breakouts that I’ve had in a long time all over my chin, nose, and even pustules on my forehead, which I never typically get since I was in puberty. It made my skin visibly oily. Very oily. Like when I used to use stridex pads in middle school. It smells horrible and doesn’t leave your skin with a pleasant feeling either. They even warn you that it may give you an unpleasant sensation. Not a good sign!! Your skincare shouldn’t sting and make you wince when you apply it. If it does, it is damaging your skin. Stay away. I’ll keep using the mask, but these products are losers in my book"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,One of my favorite toners,Feels refreshing and cleansing. There is a strong scent to it.
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Glamglow SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,"I absolutely LOVE this toner! I received it as a sample in the subscription box and after a couple of days was sold! I have combination skin and rosacea on the cheeks which can be very sensitive to new products and this toner did not cause a flare. In fact, it has helped tamp them down when they do flare up. I recommended this to a girlfriend and she was sold as well!"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,Love this!!!!,Best toner I've had. I will definitely be purchasing again
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,Glamglow SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,I really like this I could feel it working but like it didn’t burn or anything and it makes me acne areas turn red which makes it easier to apply spot treatment
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Malaysia,SUPERTONER,Love this product! I wasn’t sure at first what it really did but when I stopped using it I was getting back random small acne’s all over my face. It’s a good product to add to my routine to keep it fresh and clean and keep my pimples at bay. It’s tingles slightly but it goes away within seconds and you’d don’t feel it eventually. This toner is underrated! 
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Singapore,Strong,This stuff is very strong so I only recommend it on breakouts or areas prone to breakouts. I stop when skin is healthy again. Its on standby mode now. 
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Singapore,wow!,"I hesitated buying this because of the price! But after reading the reviews I went ahead. And I love this product. It’s too good until u try it. My dark spots have lighten and it clears my face really well. 

"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Singapore,add into my skincare regime,I’ve been using exfoliant toner for quite sometimes and i really love the results that gives me the glow the uneven skin and everybody compliment my skin. 
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,BEST TONER EVER,I’ve been using this toner since July 2020. It is AMAZING! Me and my boyfriend both use it and love the cooking effect it gives. The chemical exfoliation has made such a difference in my skin and it’s definitely my favorite part of my skincare routine. Kinda pricey but 100% worth every penny!!!
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Glamglow SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,"I don't know but this is my 2nd bottle on this and my skin loves it!!! I do use it morning and night and I also have the matching face wash. I use my clarisonic and wash my face, come out and use this. It makes my skin feel fresh and clean. I do still break out and I do have blackheads on my cheeks, nose and chin and I feel like it does help a lot. When I don't use it my face gets worse and I get bigger cystic pimples. So, so far so good. I most definitely say give it a try and you must be consistent!!!"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,LOVE IT!,"I've bought this toner twice now and I can't imagine my daily routine without it! I feel like it really gets into my pores, cleansing my skin. It doesn't leave my skin feeling dry at all and it helps shrink my large pores (though they don't disappear completely). It does not keep me from getting oily throughout the day, or stop me from getting the few pimples I get sometimes, but it definitely makes my skin clean and fresh before applying moisturizer make up, which I wear daily."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Glamglow SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,"I never write reviews, but I had to for this product. I was getting deep cystic acne that looked horrible! For my 40 year old skin! This is the only thing that has cleared my skin and kept it clear. It is amazing! If you are having trouble with acne get this!"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,Amazing toner,"This is the best toner I have ever used! I am on my 4th bottle and it is still working wonders for my skin. I am 36 years old and have had very sensitive skin my whole life. At age 30 I developed adult acne and have been searching for a toner that will work with my sensitive skin but help get control of my acne. This is it! 
It is very refreshing and has drastically reduced the size and visibility of my pores."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,For how much I dislike Glamglow I LOVE this toner,"I am obsessed with this toner! As others have mentioned, Denat Alcohol is the second ingredient which isn’t necessarily a good thing. HOWEVER, this toner has transformed my skin and kept it looking amazing. I am n the drier side and it did not dry it out even more like some other exfoliating toners I’ve tried. Nor did I get some of the irritation I’ve experienced before. I am typically not a Glamglow fan but I will be keeping this on hand. When I first started I used it night and day. Now that my skin has cleared I only use it at night and a different one in the day!"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Great for acne and oil!,"Minus the smell, this product is AMAZING. My skin is naturally oily and acne prone (thanks PCOS) and this keeps my skin clear without totally drying it out."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,Surprisingly effective,"I would give this product a 5/5 for results but I took a star off as the ingredients seem insane lol. I have heard many licensed estheticians nix witch hazel and I feel like 5 acids in 1 product is quite harsh (although I could be wrong given some in here are more ‘gentle’ than others such as lactic acid).
HOWEVER! The results blew me away. I get painful, huge cystic zits on my chin when I PMS. I also have a little regular acne on my cheeks as well. I regularly use a full skincare routine including exfoliation with Dermalogica microfoliant or a prescribed a benzoyl peroxide from a derm. This keeps my skin at bay, but every month the cystic PMS zits still come.
 I felt one forming last week and thought I’d just try to blast it lol. I used the Glam Glow super mud mask and then I left this toner on overnight. The next morning, instead of the zit being formed as usual, it was almost gone. I iced it and used this toner every other day for the week I PMS’d and the cystic zits never came... it was unreal.
(I applied this on top of my CosRX snail mucin and The Ordinary HA and then put on Cerave moisturizer + healing ointment and my dry, sensitive skin wasn’t too damaged). I’d say it’s worth a shot with a very hydrating routine"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Singapore,Hmmm,I’m very neutral on this one as I am not quite sure if it is effectively keeping my skin toned and I find the alcohol scent too strong. Will not repurchase it.
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,Love how it works.  Dislike the smell.,Love this product.  Taking a star however because of the smell.  I’m not a fan of black liquorice and that’s all I can smell.  But thankfully my other products I use cover up that smell after application.
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Singapore,my daily routine ,"My forth time buying this product, and it becomes the first step of morning and night skin treatment routine. My pimples disappear and it makes my skin look brighter and cleaner. Will continue buying this. However, For those who did not try acid product before, this might be too strong for you."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Amazing HOLY GRAIL,"It’s my holy grail - perfect for acne prone skin. Helps with my acne, oiliness, and pore size. HIGHLY recommend even for the price tag!"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,ANCE GONE!!!,"I have never written a review and I buy so many products but had to write about this one!!! I’ve tried EVERYTHING to clear up acne and make my skin flawless, nothing worked until this!!! FIRST DAY I saw a massive difference. It’s week 2 now and literally my face looks better than ever. This is a game changer and worth every single penny!!"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,LOVE,A favourite part of my skincare routine!! Works great for my skin!
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Singapore,great for oily skin,"I have extremely oily skin and this works great on it without drying it out. The exfoliating effect is apparent too and very helpful. The brand is expensive, so I usually wait for sales but definitely worth purchasing. "
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Malaysia,Good,"I love the cooling sensation when applying it on my face, the scent smells like alcohol to me, but still can accept it. Feel my face is soft and smooth after using. Good but expensive"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Incredible toner for breakouts!,"Received this as a sample and absolutely love it! If I feel even the slightest blemish coming, I apply this toner and it immediately clears my skin up. Even my husband started using it, he is much more prone to breakouts, and it clears his skin up over night. Buying a full size and keeping in stock in my house!"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Rebound oily skin after use,"I love GlamGlow products and use the serum,  cleanser & moisturizer.   I wanted this toner to work for me so badly that I kept at it, almost finishing the bottle.   The pros: my pores are smaller and there is an immediate fresh clean feeling after using it.  The Cons:  BIG CON for me is probably due to the alcohol in the formula, I got oily skin just about 2 hours after using.  I tried leaving it out of my routine several days and it was definitely the culprit.   GlamGlow has some great products, but this one may not be the best for you if you have oily skin like me."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,eh,It’s a very strong chemical exfoliate. Best for oily skin would definitely not work for dry skin. It reeks of alcohol which doesn’t rlly bother me and is fairly stripping to the face.
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Highly Effective Exfoliating Toner,"I really love this stuff. Does not bother my sensitive, Rosacea-probe skin and helps with texture over a fairly short period of time. In my experience does not cause a burning sensation but works like a strong exfoliating acid product."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,must buy,"This stuff keeps my skin looking and feeling amazing, I’ve tried to find another toner that compares for cheaper but there is nothing else out there that compares."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Cleared up my skin!,I initially tried this product as a sample from Sephora’s “Play” monthly makeup subscription box. I loved it so much and purchased the full size.  Ever since I added this to my face routine my skin has been pretty much blemish free. I apply a small amount onto a cotton ball and sweep all over my clean face especially on my T zone where I tend to be a little more oily. I follow with a moisturizer after and have not had any problems with dryness.
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,FANTASTIC!,This is such a great toner.  You shake to activate it and it makes your skin tingly fresh. It leaves my skin feeling extra clean and almost feels cooling when you apply it.  It's nothing like I have ever tried before.. it's fantastic.  Will keep repurchasing it.
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,No!,The ingredients in this are terrible. Alcohol denat is the second ingredient along with witch hazel. These two are terrible for the skin and are very drying. Aviod!
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,cooling and cleans well,"Been researching for a strong toner that provides both AHAs and BHAs and this one looked like it fit the bill. Granted the dark color did turn me off a bit but the charcoal just stays on the pad you’re using. Had a couple occurrences of minor acne with the summer heat and mask wearing so adding back a deep clean toner into my routine. So far on first use, skin feels clean and there’s a cooling sensation after sweeping across your face. Hopefully after a week’s use we can see the acne pop ups under control."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Singapore,can feel the tightening,"Got this on sale did not regret the purchase. I use it as a night toner and the skin tightening effect is definitely there, which is what i want. Will need to use it for a longer time before i can determine its long term effecta. "
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Too drying,"I have combo skin that is often sensitive. I bought this toner because I was looking to combat the acne developing due to wearing a face mask 24/7 as a healthcare worker. For the first day or so, this worked great! I only applied to problem areas, my skin felt clean, and the cooling sensation is lovely. But after day 3 or so of using this toner, my skin began to burn and peel. I've used acid toners religiously before but this one really messed up my skin...don't buy it. You'll spend more time (and money) fixing the problems it causes."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,loveee,"an amazing product to add to your beauty regimen. i don’t use cotton balls, i simply pour a bit in my hand and rub my hands together and apply."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Great Acid Toner for beginner,"I started with two samples of this product since parts of my face is very sensitive. After finishing the two samples U have, I found it won’t make my skin irritate or whatever and did significantly improved my acne situation."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,Glamglow SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,"Amazing toner, that actually made a visible difference in my skin. I received a sample of it, and didn’t even think twice about it and was sitting under the sink for a few months. I took it on a trip, and used it for a week and my black heads disappeared, i knew then I needed a full bottle! My skin has never been better my entire adult life! Holy grail!! 10/10 will repurchase"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Great Toner,I never stuck with using any toner until trying this last year. I use it every day. It leaves my skin feeling nice and clean without any tacky or sticky feeling at all. Keeps blemishes away and definitely improves skin texture. I actually like the way it smells.
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Brightens and Glows,I was hesitant at first to buy this product because of the price. I purchased this and the supermud mask in a moment of desperation and I’m so glad I did. My skin feels so much better after using both products and the toner in particular has helped brighten my skin and help keep my pores clean. I can definitely feel a difference after a week of using this product.
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Holy Grail Product,I have been using this product for over a year and it is my holy grail toner. i use it every morning and its not drying and I love that afterward my face has a noticeable glow after. I love that it is exfoliating. I have not found a toner like it. I am obsessed.
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,helped with my large pores,"I have large pores and since I’ve been using this toner it helped clean my pores, helped with my texture and I don’t get acne anymore. I tried the small size from the set and now buying the full size."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Saved my skin,"Saved my skin! I have fairly sensitive skin and take medication for my acne, so I don't use every day, but I do use it often now that my county requires masks. I use it on the trouble areas (under my mask) at nighttime and to keep clean if I've picked at anything. Seriously has helped my skin so much. If any acne is open, try to avoid the bump itself or it will hurt, but it helps around the area. A little on a cotton ball or pad goes a long way! I'll forever be into this product!"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,sad that it didn’t work for me,"dried out my skin, took me so long to recover it :("
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Deep cleans!,"Great product! I use an expensive  facial cleanser in the shower. I applied this after and was surprised to find how much dirt was still left on my face. I often feel like I need to rinse after a toner, but this left my face feeling really clear."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Singapore,so far so good ,Feels very clean and astringent which is good for my oily skin. However the smell is just.... unbearable. It has a cooling sensation too but sometimes when I use too much I can feel my skin drying out. 
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,"Amazing product, helps with keeping acne at bay.",The only toner I use that proved to be helpful in clearing out acne. Cleanses the pores well and removes any dirt the face wash had missed. I use it daily paired with the mask of the same product line which clears my skin from acne within 48-72 hours. Highly recommended.
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Keeps My Skin Balanced,"I really feel like this helps to keep my skin nice and balanced bc since I started using it I have no breakouts.  I finished a bottle and stopped using it and the breakouts came back... I bought another bottle and the breakouts have gone away again!  So yes, it is drying but i always moisturize right after I swipe the toner on my face.  And you can use once a day or twice a day.  I know my skin and I can tell when I may need it twice that day and I know when my skin would be fine only using at night time.  This works for me."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,For that Fresh face feeling,So I’ll be honest I did not see a drastic difference when I used this toner compared to my regular toner. However this toner leaves your skin feeling amazing and if you have oily or combination skin I love to use it right before I ally my primer.
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,BEST TONER EVER,Best toner everrrr!! It removes everything! And it makes my face feel soooo clean afterwards!!
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Singapore,good exfoliater ,"This is a product that works. Helps unclog pores and therefore make them look smaller. However I do want to mention that it is very strong and has some stripping/ drying ingredients. As such, may not be a good idea to use it everyday as it may dry out the skin with too much use. "
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Glamglow SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,This clears my pores and gives my skin a fresh tightening without stripping my skin. I use twice a day. My skin feels better and my skin isn’t dull. Certainly worth the price.
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,SMELLS SO STRONG,"The smell is so overwhelming that I have to hold my breath while applying.  The smell is waaay stronger than the super mud mask which I absolutely love.  It's really disappointing that I can't get over the smell because other than that the product works well.  It leaves my skin feeling nice and soft. If you can get past the smell, it's a good product"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Singapore,smells like chocolate mint ice cream with that icy feeling,smells like chocolate mint ice cream with that  icy feeling after application. My face feels clean. Give that whimsical bottle a lil shake and u see the charcoal and shimmer swirling. Pretty cool. My first bottle so have to wait to see result but willing to give a 4 star review
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Go-To during breakouts!,"I have dry skin, but get really severe hormonal cystic breakouts on my chin. This has been a newfound lifesaver. I use this in conjunction with the Mario Badescu Buffering Lotion, and my cystic shrinks overnight and is gone by the 3rd day! It does have a strong smell, but it doesn't bother me. The combinations of active ingredients definitely work for targeting my breakouts. I do not use this as a daily toner."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,this is your new best friend,"This product is EVERYTHING, let me start with that.

During the winter I started noticing I was getting VERYYYYY oily skin (it’s winter shouldn’t I be more dry? lol). I was out of this toner and I had another “oil control toner” in my cupboard that I wanted to try anyways. Welpppp that didn’t work at all. I noticed my acne was coming back very strong and my oily face was getting worse. So I decided to order GG toner again and I WILL NEVER leave this toner again. It is an essential for anyone with acne prone, textured, oily skin. It has everything in it you need. 

Now I only use this once a day, before bed. And that’s all I need. I know black liquorice is a love/hate smell so if you HATE it, this may not be for you, but I promise you this product is amazing!

Only only put a 4 star because it’s a little in the pricey side. Usually my toners cost around 28-34$ CAN, but I’ll still keep buying this anyways because it’s the only thing that actually works in my skin!!"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Can't Live Without,"My skin is impossible.  It's super sensitive and oily in the t-zone.  I still have cystic acne (in my mid-50's!) and rosacea, and of late have started developing seborrheic keratosis and sebaceous hyperplasia growths :(  I am prone to allergic reactions and rashes from tons of different things.  I also still have very old, deep acne scars from my cystic acne.  I first used Pixi Glow Tonic (a glycolic acid) and liked it but didn't notice any big difference in my skin so, I started doing research on facial acids and realized I really needed multiple different acids for everything I was trying to accomplish and found this gem.  My t-zone is oily but the rest of my skin is normal and I use this EVERY morning and have no problems.

First, it's easy - Shake it (really important to activate it), put it on a cotton round, smooth it on, wait 30 seconds and move on to serum.  Second, I haven't found any negatives.  I don't notice a smell, my makeup goes on perfectly over it, and my skin does not get itchy or rashy or anything else.

Second, and best of all, my skin condition has RADICALLY improved.  My old acne scars are not as deep and my skin is just much smoother overall.  I didn't tell anyone I was using it and my daughter was the first to comment that my scars were less visible.  I will admit that I don't think it did much for my existing seborrheic keratosis or sebaceous hyperplasia (found Paula's Choice 9% BHA for those!) but I am completely in love with this product and will never be without it."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Glamglow SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,"I’ve been using this toner for over a year now (I’m on my third bottle). I now realize how amazing it truly is and how much I need it in my routine! I revamped skincare routine a year ago so I used a bunch of new products at once. I saw huge a huge improvement in my skin. I’ve always had tiny bumps on my forehead. The bumps completely cleared a year ago with my new skincare routine but I couldn’t accurately say that it was because of this toner because I was using so many new products. Fast forward to two weeks ago when I stopped using this, my forehead bumps were back! I quickly started using this toner again and my bumps are gone again. This is a must have in my skin care routine! It actually works!"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,my favorite toner,"I love this toner.  it exfoliates my skin and evens it out.  it might be too strong for sensitive skin, but works well for my combination 44 year old skin."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Glamglow SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Love love love the way this makes my face feel. Totally recommend it
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,Super strong.,"I bought the whole glam glow line because charcoal, and their products in general, work really well for my skin. But, this stuff is strong. If I have any blemishes on my skin they basically turn into scabs after I use this. I’ve switched to only using this in the am if I don’t wash my face because if I wash my face and use this it is way too irritating."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,Favourite toner so far!,"This is my favorite toner so far and I have tried a few. It has been one of the only products to clear up my occasional acne. Every other product I have tried gives me pimples!!! I recently tried the Ole toners, and they suck compared to this. Tried to find something new, but I found myself purchasing my third bottle today."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Out with the Oil & in with the Clean!,"Received in my BeautyInsider box. I have incredibly oily skin & whenever I use this, I feel so refreshed, clean, and revitalized to start my day! This opens up my pores and has even helped unclog some painful pimples overnight! Would’ve given 5 stars if it was $10 less."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,the best toner,"Awesome toner, really enjoy using it. I can really see a difference it makes after I use it. Makes me feel very clean and ready for my moisturizer."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,Glamglow SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,"Honestly, best toner I have found for my skin. Because of the pandemic I had to switch to a different one and I broke out like crazy. When I was able to get another bottle my breakout was gone in a week! Love this is"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,WOW!! AMAZING,WOW!! ive had breakout problems for years now and ones i stated using this toner my breakout has never been better! I've been using it for 2 days and my regular breakout spots have learned up while my other breakout spots seem less red and inflamed. I couldn't recommend this toner enough to someone with combination skin.
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Nah... duped by the sample,"Purchased this cause the sample I had was amazing. How can salicylic acid toner harm skin so bad? I
End up breaking out the next day or two."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,New favorite toner!,I love this stuff - such a unique formula/product and I’m so glad I tried it! My skin feels incredibly clean after this toner. I use it as part of my nightly skin regimen and it’s been a great addition to my routine. I have combination skin and am prone to breakouts in my oily areas but this stuff has really helped to keep my skin clear. I’m also sensitive so I do I think this would be too drying for my skin if I used it AM and PM. (I use a different toner in the AM and this one at night.) I seriously look forward to using it every night!
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,GlowGlam<3,"Throughout my skin journey, all the ups and downs and whether I have been aware or not.. a key element of any successful skin regime is a toner.This toner is amazing: how it feels and applies as well as the results. I have dry skin so I use this at night only followed by a moisturizing toner. Amen GlamGlow, this one has potential."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Buy it!,"This toner is AMAZING! I'm so sad I waited so long to try this.  it's hard to explain, but your face feels so amazingly clean after using this!  I don't think I will switch back to any other toners I've previously used."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Great pore cleanser,My skin feels refreshed after each use and is much clear. I love this formula
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Glamglow SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Love this stuff!!! It has really helped clear up my face. I use it every night.
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,1st try.,"So far so good. I received this in my birchbox. I was afraid to use it because of the smell. I read the reviews on how to apply and how it works. I do have pores. A light tingle on my chin, but I put it on my nose, chin, head, and cheeks. I do have dry skin, but I will be applying serum and a moisturizer like Kiels. I will give a better review once I've used it for a longer period of time or until I run out."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,Glamglow SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,must have product! Best toner if you have pores and if you want a clear skin.
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Get This!!!!,"Wow!!!! Some time back I received a sample of this as part of the rewards points with a purchase. I put it aside and forgot about it. Fast forward a bit, I found it in my beauty drawer and started to use it. It has been so effective on my face helping to keep it clear and smooth my face. My make up looks better on and i see clear improvement. I purchased the full size bottle."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Glamglow SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,"Love this toner! Smells a tad like licorice, but works great. Skin feels clean, and is super soft after using."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,MUST TRY FOR CLOGGED PORES,"I've used so many different toners (not even exaggerating), and this toner is by far the absolute best. I struggle with clogged pores around my chin area, and this toner in the matter of a few weeks has really sucked out most of the gunk. The more and more I use it the better my face gets. It leaves my face very smooth as well due to the exfoliating factor of the product. If you suffer from clogged pores this is a must try."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,favorite toner so far,"I LOVE this toner, I’m almost done my first bottle. It really made a difference in my skin, it feels so clean. I experienced a slight tingling sensation the first few times I used it and now I don’t, I use it every day in my night time routine, after double cleansing and on a cotton round. It just really feels like it’s working when you put it on. the smell is interesting smells like jager so using this when your hungover is a little rough haha. I went on vacation and brought a different sample size toner and it just wasn’t working for me like this one does, my skin wasn’t looking as good as normal. I was happy to start using it again when I got back home. The reason for 4 stars is the pricing, it is worth it but just expensive."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,Glamglow SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,"Compared to other toners I have used, I have seen the biggest improvements in my face with this toner."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,THE BEST TONER I'VE EVER USED IN MY LIFE!!!,"You have to shake the bottle each time before you use it, because the charcoal powder inside, sinks to the bottom. When you shake it, it's so pretty and looks like glitter. I love that not a lot comes out at once, like other toners, so precious (expensive) product isn't wasted. It has a very tiny hole that you shake the bottle to get the product to come out a drop at a time. I needed like 5 or 6 shakes for my cotton pad. I used this Supertoner after the GLAMGLOW Supercleanser that it's supposed to go with. I love that this toner does not burn even though it has 6 different acids in it. I popped a pimple before using the toner and it did not burn. The toner smells like mint and mattifyed my oily skin. My skin is so clean, soft, and smooth right now, without any oiliness. It's so amazing. Yes, this was $42 but this is the only toner I know that has all of these great ingredients in it, so I'll accept the price. I'm 85% sure that I would repurchase this. Literally, the only turn off is the price. I highly recommend this though, because it's a strong toner that doesn't burn and the packaging is so cute on my bathroom shelf."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Canada,It Works,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This toner makes your skin feel actually clean! You can feel The difference when you use this on your face is amazing, you feel so clean! I love pretty much every item from GLAMGLOW because it actually works with instant noticeable results. When it comes to skin problems I think that’s what we all want!"
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,supertoner is right!,"I used an entire mini that came in a set,  and I already put an order to buy a full size. This is the best toner I had tried so far, with this toner I don’t have the need to apply a chemical exfoliator any longer which it will save me money in the long run. I don’t think it has a burning sensation at all. Smells like the supermud mask."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,Singapore,So so,"For this tonic, I really love the feeling and smell, it’s very cool and fresh for me. But it’s not working on my skin, no helping. Won’t but it again, there have many other cheaper and good product."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Best toner I’ve tried,"I really like this toner.  I initially got it as a trial size and I liked how it made my skin feel.  It’s sort of a tingle, not a burn like some products can be.  At first I wasn’t sure about the smell, but I have gotten quite used to it now."
GLAMGLOW-SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,USA,Glamglow SUPERTONER ™ Exfoliating Pore Clarifying Acid Solution,"I do like this product because of how intense it is, but at the same time I also don’t like it because of how intense it is, lol! Let me explain.. its great for really oily, acne prone skin... BUT it’s extremely drying. When you put it on your skin it feels like it’s burning as if you’re putting straight alcohol on it. It does have a strong licorice smell like the rest of their “super” line does so I expected that (even though it’s not my fav) but my skin always gets so flakey, red and dry afterwards and I think they could have made this product a little less harsh while still getting the job done! I don’t think I would repurchase, which is a first because I am a total glamglow junkie!"
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy Lotion Light,Malaysia,moisturising,Bought this for my cousin. Preps the skin with moisture without stickiness or tackiness. Lightweight texture and does not clog pores. She prefers the light version over the moist one. 
ESTÉE LAUDER-Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Radiant Energy Lotion Light,Malaysia,light!,Love the smell and the texture of the lotion. Noticed good change in the skin from being pale to having a slight flush. Slightly expensive but worth it. Considering my second bottle
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Micro-Pore Mist,Canada,Dermalogica Clear Start Micro-Pore Mist,"Fantastic mist, feels refreshing and reduces my pores and redness, I highly recommend it!!"
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Micro-Pore Mist,Canada,So Underrated!,"This product is so underrated and I wish more people knew about it/used it! It has helped even out my tone/texture, breakouts, redness, maskne, you name it! HOWEVER!!! I find the trick is to not spray it directly on your face…I spray one spray into my palm and take my other fingers and dab/press it into my skin. I find it actually works itself into the skin much better and I see far better results. For the quantity and price point, it’s awesome!! Will continue to keep this as a yearly staple!!"
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Micro-Pore Mist,Canada,Dermalogica Clear Start Micro-Pore Mist,Really good product! I have combo skin with a lot of oil in my t-zone. I use it in the morning and at night and it has reduced my redness and helped with some of my breakouts! I love how refreshing it is and I love the smell! Definitely recommend! I haven’t noticed anything around the pores in my nose so that’s why I didn’t give it 5 stars!
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Micro-Pore Mist,Canada,Dermalogica Clear Start Micro-Pore Mist,"I like using this product before make up, I do see a small difference with my pores but it’s not long lasting."
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Micro-Pore Mist,Malaysia,Just a normal mist,"Not a must-have, IMO, especially for that price. Has a very strong cucumber fragrance, cant really see any discernable difference. Just using it up, wont repurchase. "
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Micro-Pore Mist,Canada,Miracle product,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Got this as a sample from Sephora and will definitely be purchasing. Price point is amazing and it did in 4 days what retinol couldn’t over a one year period for me! I usually just spray it on my hands and pat it on my face as that way I can control where the product goes and not near my eyes. I’ve dabbed it on a breakout and it’s made me it completely disappear by morning. Can’t recommend this product enough for anyone struggling from mask acne!
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Micro-Pore Mist,Canada,Dermalogica Clear Start Micro-Pore Mist,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) just got this as a free sample and i'm obsessed. balanced the tone of my skin & noticeably shrunk the size of my pores. i have naturally larger pores, and oily skin, and hours later i still am noticing the benefits. 100% buying the full size."
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Micro-Pore Mist,Malaysia,It stings! ,Perhaps one of the ingredients is not suitable for my oily-sensitive-skin as it stings and dried out my eye area. Tried it few times hoping probably it’s the first time but not. This is just not for me. 
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Micro-Pore Mist,Canada,Dermalogica Clear Start Micro-Pore Mist,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I recieved this as a free sample, and after usage, it immediately reduced the size of my pores. It has a nice, fresh scent as well. Waiting on my full size!"
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Micro-Pore Mist,Canada,Dermalogica Clear Start Micro-Pore Mist,"I love dermalogica.   I love all their products.   I’m unsure if I got a bad bottle but when I spray it, it shoots in a horizontal line across my face, drips too.   I have their ultra calming mist and it actually mists your face.     This bottle does not.   I will be reaching out because at this point I will return.   Will need a second try to actually review the product because it’s not usable right now"
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Micro-Pore Mist,Canada,Very Refreshing,Purchased this about two weeks ago. I have oily skin and large pores. After a shower ill spray this on my face and it feels amazing and I notice my pores reduce in size afterwards. Wouldn't spray on top of moisturizer as it can cause more oil production.
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Micro-Pore Mist,Malaysia,Face Mist,I don't like the strong smell of cucumber. It really make me feel uncomfortable whenever I sprayed in on my face. Not gonna repurchase or use it anymore
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Micro-Pore Mist,Malaysia,Wasn’t expecting that,"It was my first try with facial mist and this brand. Been having issues with maskne under my chin due to longer use of face mask. But after applying this to my face, I’ve seen almost instant results. After a week, my maskne was gone. For real. No more maskne around my chin area. My face felt smooth n soft. The smell was refreshing. But have to give it 4 star due to the price and the size of the bottle. Other than that is’t just perfect. Might consider buying this for the result it gave. "
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Micro-Pore Mist,Canada,great toner,"Great toner. Because of the mask, I had pimples and scars on my chin. Since I’m using this product, I have less blackheads and my chin doesn’t « sweat » as much when I wear my mask. It also helped me with my scars, they are less visible each day! Personally, I think this product is more effective when you spray it in your hands and then put it on your face. For the price, you should try it :)"
DERMALOGICA CLEAR START-Micro-Pore Mist,Canada,Hydrating and soothing for acne-prone skin,"Saw this was a new, reasonably priced Dermalogica product so had to try it! Overall, I’m satisfied. My morning toner I was using in the summer started feeling too drying on my skin now that it’s getting colder in Ontario, Canada. I switched to this one a few weeks ago. It felt very soothing and hydrating. It’s very calming with a nice dose of niacinamine. Can’t say I’ve seen dramatic improvement in my skin, but it is also just a spray toner. That said, don’t buy this product with the expectation that your pores and blackheads will completely disappear. If you’re down for added hydration with a nice lil boost of niacinamide in your routine - I say go for it! :)"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,I am in love with La Mer's Moisturizing Matte Lotion!!! A little truly goes a long way. Doesn't leave my skin feeling too greasy or too dry. It's always just right. Definitely recommend & will be buying the full size.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,Singapore,best moisturiser for me so far!,love how this product feels on my face. i have sensitive and oily skin and it helps to control oil throughout the day. my skin looks brighter somehow too. however it might be too costly a price to pay for beauty 😂
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,A great alternative for oily skin,"The Moisturizing Matte Lotion has a beautiful and lightweight texture. A little goes a long way, absorbs quickly, and doesn't feel sticky on the skin. Make my skin soft and hydrated. It's perfect for oily skin because doesn't feel heavy at all. It has an overpowering scent for my acne-prone skin. It's a great lotion but not my favorite."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,"This lotion is great. It was my very first product from the brand, and I liked it. I would give this one 4 out of star for the reason that my skin felt slightly irritated as it was absorbing the product because of some of the ingredients."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Gives a nice matte finish,"I received a small sample of this product in exchange for an honest review. And I am a big fan not of this moisturizer! My skin does not feel as hydrated as it does when I use other La Mer products. I do like how it gives the skin a matte look though. 

I would not recommend."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,"this was the best lotion i’ve ever tried, and i wish i could use this more often because the results with one night use are incredible. now i know why it’s a favorite for celebrities. it has a faint fragrance but nothing overwhelming."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,"This is a really nice moisturizer, especially for oily skin. I love that I only need to use a little bit when applying and it leaves my skin feeling really soft. I also really like the fragrance and don’t think it’s too overpowering."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,It sucks that I got only a sample because this moisturizing lotion is amazing! It glides so smoothly onto my skin and makes it super plump without making it oily at the same time! Highly recommend but it’s expensive!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Great!,I have been so picky with moisturizer for the fact it can cause me to break out so quickly if I use one that contains too much oil. But this one worked wonders it hydrates the right areas without making my oil prone areas any oiler!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,I do think this lotion is great. It smells so great and luxurious! I do like the packaging. I do not understand why it's so pricey. I think it's great but I do not think I would spend the money on this product.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Nice but the fragrance is strong,This moisturizer feels really good on the skin and leaves your skin super soft and smooth. It’s a great priming moisturizer to use before makeup. My only issue is that the fragrance is so strong and it lingers for some time. It would be great to see a fragrance free version of this!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,"Amazing lotion! This is a great primer for makeup which helps with pores and making easy, smooth makeup application. My skin is so soft after using it! Loving this for my makeup routine. Definitely recommend, 10/10!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Love!,Absolutely love this moisturizer. It wore great on my skin under my makeup and improved the overall texture of my skin after several days of using. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a new moisturizer
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,This is a must have if you have texture you’d like to conceal without makeup. The matte nature of this product makes me skin look tighter and firmer. A little bit goes a long way so only put one or two pea sized drops and pat it in!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,applying it feels SO good,"I was really hoping this lotion was just extremely overpriced moisturizer but it's actually amazing for my oily skin. It even accounts for any facial oils in my skincare routine and, without looking dry, leaves me with perfectly matte skin all day/night. Has a very light scent. I'd say it's worth it if you can afford to incorporate it into your daily routine. If not, I wouldn't break the bank for it; although it is also perfect for special occasions"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,A must have for oily skin!!,"As someone with very oily skin, I must say I was very impressed with this lotion. It glides on the skin sooo nicely and doesn’t leave a shiny/oily residue like other moisturizers do. I’d also like to add that a little goes a long way!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,"I have never used anything from la mer before because it is a luxury brand, however I always said is one brand I would like to try one day, and this was it! I love the lotion is nourishing, absorbs very quick, feels luxurious to the skin and provides a matte finish !"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,Lamer doesn't dissapoint.   This is such a good cream.  It applies beautifully.  The smell is beautiful but not overpowering.  It absorbs fast. There is no greasy feel at all. This cream is perfect for  upcoming winter months. This is a very luxurious cream. After application my skin feels velvety. Couldn't love the feeling more. Highly reccomend
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Love it!,"I am new to La Mer's products but I am in love with this! When they say a little goes a long way, they mean it!!! The smallest drop will moisturize so deeply and will help nourish your skin. I can't wait to try more of La Mer's products!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Great product,"Overall, I really enjoyed using this matte moisture lotion made my skin look really great with and without make up on it didn’t leave my face to dry. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. 10/10"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Scent will be an issue,"It’s probably a great product, but I can’t get past the scent. Like many high end products this has a strong rose scent, while it didn’t bother me too bad, the scent does linger and will 100% bother those sensitive"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Perfectly matte and combo skin friendly,"I’ve always struggled with finding matte moisturizers suitable for my combo skin, as I either find them not moisturizing enough or not matte enough. This product erased both of those concerns. It is moisturizing but keeps the oil around my tzone at bay. While I do need to reapply powder after 6 or so hours, I definitely notice it keeps my tzone matte for much longer than other comparable products I have tested in the past."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,"A little goes a long way! The scent of this is comforting and nostalgic - that classic, clean smell. It absorbs nicely and leaves skin soft and moisturizes. It doesn’t get greasy or pill! Pricey but would recommend"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,"I recently got to try La Mer’s moisturizing matte lotion. It was a small sample but you really don’t need much of it because it goes a long way. The moisturizer is a light, which was a plus. It also dried matte. It didn’t leave your face greasy. It does have a strong fragrance, which I’m not typically a fan of. The moisturizer was nice and but I typically like more moisturizing products. I would not purchase."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,amazing product,"I love La Mer, my mother worked at the counter at Neimain's for years. We always had this at our house. A little goes a long way with it. It is luxury for a reason. I can tell a difference in my face texture right away. I love the refreshing fragrance as well."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Good but pricey!,"I love this brand overall.  The scent is so nice and light, smells so good.  Super light lotion that makes my skin feel really soft, and has a nice matting so that I can still use makeup over it.  Doesn’t feel greasy or tacky like other have.  Love it, but I don’t know if I could afford to keep purchasing."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Okay,"This is my first time using La Mer products I am not to impressed it’s a okay moisturizer, it has a nice texture and i It give you a finishing  Matte that is good for oily skins also this moisturizer improves the appearance of the pores . But I think you can find a better option out there doing the same"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,My skin is loving this!,"I really love the way this product makes my skin feel. A little goes a long way which I enjoy in my products, especially my skin care. It’s quite smooth, not tacky, and has a great light scent. I have been using it every day, and I can feel that my skin is noticeably softer."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,A Must For Oily Skin,A must for anyone with oily skin. It literally mattifies the second it touches my skin and keeps me looking oil free all day. It has a similar effect as a blurring primer but also gives my skin hydration. It really does a phenomenal job of smoothing and plumping out my fine lines but that took a little bit more time to notice. The price is steep but a little goes a long way and the way it makes my skin look and feel really does make it worth it.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,"Hydrates and makes you matte, but",This La Mer product was the one that impressed me the most. It hydrates and it makes your face matte without taking away the moisture. This sat nicely on makeup and alone. I felt like my skin well taken care of. I just feel like there’s better options out there that can do the same.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Great,This is a great lotion find. I love that it’s matte because I can use it underneath my makeup in the morning without my skin looking oily and slick. I also love that a little product goes a long way.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Luxury Skincare!,"Honestly, I think this product is pretty good! The scent is very nice. I like how hydrating the product is and how moisturized my skin feels after using it! My first time using La Mer. It definitely lives up to the luxury hype!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,"I absolutely fell in love with this product. I have very dry skin so I have to use a lot of moisturizer, but I hate that it can make me look greasy at times. This gave me hydration without the extra shineI"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,Ive been looking for a matte lotion that doesnt dry me out & I feel like I’ve finally found it. This one has a matte finish but doesn’t make me look dry. It smells amazing & blends out like a dream!!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,I used this lotion on a few dry patches starting around my nose and face. It helped blur the flakiness and redness. A little goes a long way! The consistency is on the thicker side.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,"This moisturizing matte lotion from La Mer is super lightweight and is great for my combination skin. I tend to get oily in the t zone, so that’s where I concentrated this product when I applied it underneath makeup. While it’s definitely on the pricier side, a little does go a very long way, so I think this can last you for a long time!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,Singapore,Good but expensive ,This is the first time I purchased such an expensive moisturiser. This moisturiser really makes my skin matte. I minus half a star because the price increases. Even though it is good but I don’t think I will purchase again due to the high price.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Great for oily skin!,This moisturizer is very light weight! A watery cream consistency. Very lightly scented. It has a slightly fresh powdery smell. It’s mattifying when my skin is oily but also hydrating. A little product covers the surface area of my face. Approximately a pea sized drop on each check and forehead does the trick. No sticky or greasy finish!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Not worth the price,I love a good matte lotion especially in the summer when my t zone gets real oily. This is great product does exactly what it says it does. It doesn't vreak my sensitive acne prone skin out. Now would I repurchase this product no way. It's very overpriced. U cab get the same results from a product thats way cheaper.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,Canada,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,"complimentary from Lamer. Good moisturizer. Nothing special. Very hydrating, Though the smell is not my favorite. too fragrant for my liking, I don't know if I would purchase it. there are better creams out there"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,"Such a great product! It’s so luxurious, smooth, and not oily at all! My skin just drank it up! Definitely my favorite La Met product that they have. I will definitely be purchasing this product in the futute."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,"First off I'd like to note that I love the scent, however I can not justify the price of the product. I feel like you can get a product that's similar without the hefty price, but if reccomend it if you like getting luxe skincare"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,So creamy and hydrating yet at the same time mattifies enough to leave the skin balanced with not so much oil! Very pleased what it has to offer I mean it is luxurious 101 thank you so much was able to try it out!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,Wow! As someone with oily skin this lotion is perfect for my oily skin needs. I’ve tried this under makeup and makeup days and it’s helped loads with oily control. It works well in conjunction with my other products
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Good so far,This is my first time officially using a La mer product. I have combination skin with oily t-zones. I use this cream once a day with a vit c serum and sunscreen. I would recommend if you have similar skin.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,IT IS SO GOOD! Skin feels super luxe and smells divine! Works beautifully as a makeup prep over the La Mer Hydrating serum.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,The best cream I ever used! Super matte so your face doesn’t look like an oily mess!!! Perfect for acne and rosacea !!!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,Malaysia,oily skin,"I am oily skin and looks for a better matte lotion. Once I try Lamer Matte Lotion, I just gave up my all previous matte lotion, really cannot compare in terms of quality. It helps your skin stay matte and dry without dehydrated your skin. "
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Worth It,"This is a great product for oilier skin types. It never made me breakout and gives my complexion an overall “glow”, just healthy looking skin. It greatly reduces the appearance of my pores and I love this stuff."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,Malaysia,cant live without it,i have combination skin. i recommend this if u have combination skin. it work to help with your dry skin but at the same time u have oily skin to counter with. but this moisturizer wont do any good to u if u’re thinking this will give ur skin the wow effect like glow effect or anything. nope . its just a normal moisturizer. if u are looking for something to make ur skin glow . go for sk2 . lamer product only suitable to help cure ur dry skin. anyway im doing commissions potrait paintings. visit my ig thats underscore deee
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,NOT FOR DRY SKIN,NOT FOR DRY SKIN! I have somewhat dry skin. I use their creme and love it but it does make my face shiny and was hoping to use the matte lotion for a matte look for pool parties/pictures. This is super drying and piles up even without make up over it. Just horrible. The product description says moisturizing and hydrating so I figured it would still work with normal or dry skin but I was wrong.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Instant Matte Finish!,Great for oily skin! It instantly matte's your skin for the entire day without needing to reapply! Highly recommend!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,"Oil absorbing, anti-aging MIRACLE!","My skin has always been excessively oily, even into my forties. I gave up on oil-control lotions a long time ago, and relied more on primers, mattifiers, and setting powders to keep shine at bay. I've also never been wowed by La Mer products, including their previous oily skin gel...but this Moisturizing Matte Lotion changed everything! From my first days of using a sample, my face was immediately less shiny - and the shine that did break through later in the day appeared more 'glowy' than greasy. More importantly, it also offers legit anti-aging effects, plus the texture is soft and creamy, and it truly does moisturize the skin (oily skin needs moisture too!) I had no problem plunking down the cash for the full size when my sample ran out! This is a TRUE all-in-one skincare solution for oily skin, the first I've ever come across. About to buy my second bottle. :)"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,"I’d say it’s just so so. It’s not a bad product but it defeats the purpose of la mer creams. If you have combination skin I’d recommend the soft cream and if you have oily skin, then the gel cream would be better than this one."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Perfect for daytime and oily skin,I’m really loving this product. I have oily skin and this is one of the few moisturizers I’ve tried that moisturizes effectively and leaves my skin with a matte finish even after hours of wear under my makeup. This is a perfect daytime moisturizer with my other skincare layered underneath and my sunscreen over top. I dropped a star because I dislike the fragrance and wish it was fragrance free. Luckily the scent goes away in less than an hour.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,Ok I have to say this after reading all the reviews for the dummy’s who decided to buy a MATTE lotion when they have dry skin! It’s for people with oily skin people!!! It helps with the oils but it’s not life changing.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Highly Recommend,"After 25 years of trying different face lotions, I decided it was time to spend some money and see it La Mer lived up to the hype. Seeing as I have combination, sometimes very oily, fair/sensitive skin with occasional breakouts, I have never before found something that I LOVED. But this product is wonderful. Not only does my skin just look better, it causes zero breakouts and my skin has not been oily once. I should also mention that the last time I had a facial the technician told me that my skin was as soft as a baby's."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Don't waste your money on this if you got dry skin,"I have dry skin and this is not moisturizing enough. It rolls up on my face even if I don't apply makeup, which makes using this under foundation impossible. The few times I tried a had to go wash my face and use a different moisturizer instead."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,meh,"I've been using the classic La Mer moisturizing cream for awhile and find it very hydrating and do minimize pore efficiently. This lotion is def NOT as performative as the classic cream version like it claims. It does absorb fast and does not leave any shine like the classic cream but it has also lost the magic power of La Mer. In general, works as a day cream but not worth the price."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,Finally a La Mer cream for the Combo/oily skins!,Truly a miracle worker. You get all the benefits of the miracle rejuvenating broth of la mer in matte! No shine no film left after application. The product is quickly absorb and leaves your face looking doll like! Better than a primer! I don't understand the other reviews about this cream being greasy?! I'm combo/oily and acne prone. This is the best out there!! Finally! Thank you La mer! Also this is perfect for the younger crowd too!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,great for oily skin,I bought this hoping to control the shine & Tzone. Works great. I have been using during the day & have been using for 3 weeks. I have the softest skin & starting to get wrinkles gone. It's expensive but I'm sure I have spent more money on finding the best. So far I have.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,good but doesn't control shine,"I have oily skin and I'm always looking for moisturizers to control oil. This is a good moisturizer but it doesn't control shine. I was just as shiny if not more shiny after using this. I tried for several days with same result. Not a bad product, but doesn't control shine well."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,love it,This lotion is moisturizing without drying out face too much. Very light weight! I love it
LA MER-The Moisturizing Matte Lotion,USA,The Best Matt lotion EVER!,"I got Lamer's all lotions and I am a huge fan of Lamer, I got almost all their products and This is the best lotion I have ever had!!! So so perfect for summer, and it makes the makeup flawless as well:)"
PHILOSOPHY-Microdelivery Resurfacing Solution,Canada,Fine Line Wizard,"I got a little sample of this, and at the time I was living with a lot of stress and started developing so many fine lines and creases for the first time. Within a week I saw my lines minimized drastically, and my overall complexion just looked more even and my skin tighter. The sample lasted a while, but when I ran out it SHOWED.. so now this is a product I can't live without."
PHILOSOPHY-Microdelivery Resurfacing Solution,Singapore,Effective exfoilant ,"This product is very effective in exfoliating. However, daily use is not recommended for users with sensitive skin. Minus points for unpleasant fragrance."
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,Malaysia,BF enjoys it,Bought for my bf and he likes it. He has sensitive skin with blemishes and redness. This helps soothing the skin with the redness overall a great product for sensitive skin 
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,Malaysia,glow effect,love this product. Very mosturising and refreshing. I work at constuction site and its very helpful for my full skin. I dont know its do the job or not but worth to try. Trully amazing. 
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,Singapore,Dr Jart Cica,"Moisture locking toner with ingredients that prevent water evaporation!

Highly concentrated bottle-pool extract helps calm sensitive skin quickly and moisturize it. 

* I recommend it to someone like this.
- Skin requiring sedation and sudding
- Pulling skin with a deep dry skin
- Sensitive skin exposed to micro-damage"
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,Singapore,okay product,A toner that does its job but nothing really special. I think there are a lot of other products that do the same. The packaging is quite unique though.
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,Singapore,New try,I have also been a fan of DR JART+ facial masks. They suit my facial condition which is combination nature. Hence I'm going to try their toner. Hopefully it will suit me well too 😊
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,Malaysia,Ms,"My holy grail toner! Normally my skin will acting up whenever I’m using toner. But not with this one. Really loving it! Also, paired with the calming gel, my skin is glowing."
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,Singapore,does its job but a little pricey.,"does its job to calm my skin down and prepare it for the serums and moisteirser that I would apply after the first step. however, it's a little pricey for the function. there are toners which give similar effects outside at cheaper price range."
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,Malaysia,good,can last long..like it....😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,Malaysia,Owsome!,"This toner suitable to my skin. Teksture liquid  is not so sticky and fast absorb into my skin. I will repeat again. I use everyday in morning, evening and night before serum"
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,Malaysia,Works really well in combination,"The toner is a little bit on the expensive side and I finally got it to try during Sephora Member Sales. My boyfriend has really red and sensitive skin and after using this, coupled with the other skincare from this Cicapair series, namely the serum, ampoule in a mask and gel, really saw great improvement. His skin does not break out as often anymore and redness decreased. Will repurchase."
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,Philippines,Faaaave!!,"I used to be a non-believer in toners, although Youtube got me into trying this lol. I find that it works well on its own too! As a moisturizer in warmer climate, under sunscreen. Plus, super value for money, I’ve been using this for 3 months already and am still not even halfway thru the bottle. Will definitely repurchase!"
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,Singapore,Great toner for sensitive skin!,"Bought this to try as Ive been trying out Dr Jart products. All I can say is I’ve been loving its products be it the Ceramidin line or Cicapair line. The Cicapair line is great for sensitive/trouble skin. I really like this toner even tho I didn’t see any changes to my combi normal skin while using it, but at least it didn’t broke me out. Will definitely repurchase but not from Sephora cause it’s too pricey."
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,Singapore,great toner to soothe skin,helps inflamed acne skin and works really well for combination skin. Would definitely recommend and repurchase this product. It lasted me about 6 months and my skin has felt much nicer after use
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,Singapore,nice scent,Although I am New to this brand but bought it after seeing good reviews and since there is a sale! Hope it works well with my skin type! Nice scent though 🤩🤩
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,Malaysia,love this cicapair series ,My skin was all along very good but suddenly I started having small bumps and red spots! Recommended my Sephora staffs and friends I decided to try this out and I am loving this. I cannot live without this serum now. Am using this every day and night. My skin is back to normal and even better than previously. Definitely recommend! 
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,Australia,very calming,"the applicator for this product is a bit unusual but i found the toner to work very well on my skin tone. sometimes after using face masks my skin feels sensitive and the cicapair range always hydrates and calms my skin down. this is not sticky nor thick, it has a watery consistency that sinks into the skin effortlessly"
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,Malaysia,sensitive and acne skin type,"Okay so I bought this after wanting to try a new toner as for my bodyshop previous tea tree toner and realise my skin was getting really dry and have bumps that form quickly. After using this product like for over a month I have not seen much changes for sensitivity but as for hydration it helps keep my skin smooth and fresh after applying it.. i would not repurchase this as i dont think it worked on me and would find another toner. The bottle concept is what i love the most about this product, no leakage etc "
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,,Ms,"Love this toner! The nozzle is unconventional but not hard to use. It is fresh smelling and the redness of my skin has gone down. The only thing is that its a little sticky on the skin but if it helps my skin, I'd deal with it!"
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,,Bought it for my sister,My sister has an acne prone skin and i bought this for her. So far her skin condition had become better and the acne reduces. Recommend to use this product if you have acne prone skin.
DR.JART+-Cicapair Toner,,Calming and soothing goodness!,Does exactly what is expected. Reduced redness and inflammation for my sensitive skin. Love everything in the cicapair line and will repurchase  when it runs out. 
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion,Malaysia,hydrating lotion all around,"A great addition to clinique family and this works well on my skin. No bad reaction and no funky smell at all, so its already a win in my beauty arsenal "
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion,Malaysia,Ms,"Fast delivery and received in good condition. Can’t wait to use it. However, I’m purchase for full size but didn’t get the 15ml moisturiser free gift."
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion,Canada,Good hydrating toner,"It's hydrating, effectively preps my skin for serums, and never makes my skin feel tight or stripped down. It's a watery lotion with a milky hue that works either when applied with a cotton pad or your fingers (press into skin for extra absorption).

When I am consistent with using this product, I find my skin stays smooth between treatments (every Sunday) and I don't have any dryness around my nose or forehead (those are my concern areas). I also find that my serums and moisturizers seep into my skin more vs. sitting on top.

Overall, I've been using this toner (Clinique calls it a lotion) for about 1.5 years and I'm happy with it. I think it'd work great for most people and would fair well for those with sensitive skin."
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion,Canada,Clinique Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion - 200ml,"I got this product as part of a bonus kit when I purchased my usual skincare faves from Clinique- I would have never thought to try it but I'm so glad I did! I thought it was one of their step 2 toners, as the packaging is similar, but this is like a watery lotion you apply before serums/lotion. A couple drops gives my skin an added boost of moisture, which I always need during harsh Canadian winters! My fav way to use this is actually after I apply my makeup- I use powdered makeup and sometimes with the winter air it just doesn't look as amazing. Moisture sprays or setting sprays were my norm but a couple drops of this patted over top of my makeup is life changing. It doesn't move my makeup and it lasts way better than a moisture spray would. You can also create a super dewy look that lasts all day if you apply a little bit more. I also love that this product has probiotics in it, my acne prone loves it!"
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion,USA,Clinique Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion - 200ml,This hydrating lotion is great for my dry skin. I love all of Clinique’s products.
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion,Canada,Clinique Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion - 200ml,I use this morning and night under different moisturizers. I can't live without it now! My skin drinks it in and feels so soft afterwards.
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion,USA,Perfect Prep,My serums and moisturizer just sink right into my dry skin after applying this product!
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion,Canada,Clinique Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion - 200ml,This is a great essence for dry and sensitive skin. It’s fragrance free and really moisturizing. I’ve recommended to many friends and they all liked it. Worth trying!
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion,USA,"This stuff is great, but not what you might expect","I am so happy Sephora is finally carrying this lotion. I use it everyday on my sensitive, oily, acne prone, 40+ skin. It’s lightly moisturizing and calming. My skin loves it. I apply it after washing and toning by placing some in the palm of my hand (sometimes I add a couple drops of niacinamide or B5 serum) and rub my hands together then slather on my face, neck and decollate.  Then I apply my beauty oil or whatever I’m using. In warmer months I’ll just use this as my moisturizer, but dryer skins types will likely need a little more moisture. There’s some kind of pro-biotic ingredient in this stuff that is incredibly soothing and helps me battle acne flare ups. I notice a big difference when I don’t use it. Keep in mind this is a watery lotion, almost like a serum. It can be used to prep skin before serum like a toner or as a light moisturizer or moisture booster that calms the skin. If your expecting a thick creamy lotion, this isn’t it... I think this would work for all skin types because it is a very versatile product."
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion,USA,Dry skin must !!!!,This  is one of my favorite Clinique products.  I use this along with dramatically different cream moisturizer and moisture surge  gel for my very dry skin.  I also add a sunblock.
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion,USA,Sensitive breakout prone skin,I have super sensitive skin that breaks out easily. This is AMAZING!! Can't live without it!!
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion,USA,AMAZING!!!,"My 1st review of a product it's that good! This has been a total game changer for me as I'm perimenopausal, therefore my skin is acting crazy. My skin: prone to breakouts, dehydration and a sensitivity to many natural ingredients. I primarily use light facial lotions, essences and hydrating toners. This product is definitely one of the best ones I use, as it most definitely helps with dryness, sensitivity and dehydration. You can apply it with cotton pads, however I put a few drops in my palm then apply to face by lightly pressing. The biggest win is it's fragrance free!! Amazing!"
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion,Canada,Okay but might cause breakouts,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Tried a sample that I got after purchasing mascara and it was really nice, made my skin feel hydrated and super soft. Only problem is I broke out after."
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion,USA,Super hydrating and moisturizing!,"Just for reference, I have combo skin with rosacea that is prone to dehydration. I originally got this as an alternative to my moisture surge gel cream because I find that it pills up when I apply my adapalene gel over it. Ever since I started using this, I’ve noticed my skin has been so soft and hydrated, and the flakiness I get this time of year is much improved. There’s been no pilling when I apply products on top and it hasn’t caused any negative reactions or breakouts. I highly recommend this if you’re either looking for a lightweight moisturizer to use on its own, or if you wanted to up the hydrating and moisturizing ability of another moisturizer you currently use. It’s really helped my skin out, and I will definitely repurchase!"
CLINIQUE-Moisture Surge Hydro-Infused Lotion,USA,breakouts,It is hydrating and makes your skin soft. unfortunately i wouldn't recommend for people with sensitive skin as it broke me out.
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Singapore,gotten rid of blemishes significantly ,This product is a saviour when i had bad break outs. You can see any blemishes shrinking. It alsi lighten scars as it brightens the skin overall. Bought the small one to test and now i will grab the big size. 
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Singapore,it works! ,"Got it during the sales and Have been using this for a while now and I Felt my face cleared of blemishes, my pores tighten and skin  Brighten. The vinegar smell isn’t that strong. Will repurchase it again! "
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Singapore,Face Toner,I bought the small size to try as it’s slightly pricer than other toners out there. It makes my skin sting on days when i have more sensitive skin. Will not continue to repurchase it as i don’t feel any significant usefulness from using it.
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Malaysia,exfoliate,"pure raw 
my face become red for the first trying
but after the second time it's going well
my skin recover and really efective
gonna repeat soon 
i was hoping for sale "
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Singapore,Not Great,"Toner caused breakouts on combination skin, and did not have any positive effects per the other comments. Have used other probiotics facial products but this product just did not work for me. "
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Singapore,trying it ,Saw and heard many great reviews for this product so decided to give it a try! Its quite pricey for a toner in my opinion so not sure if i will repurchase or stick to my current one which is cheaprr 
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Malaysia,cantik,Baguss walaupun nampak biasa Tapi product nii sangat best. Dia tak harsh di kulit saya dan kukit saua kadi sangat cantik kalau ada pimple boleh pakai 
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Singapore,Great toner for probiotics benefits…,"if we believe there’s even a thing for that for the face lol. Feels nice during use, not entirely sure about the probiotics claims but I enjoy it so that’s what matters. There are other toners out there that’s nice and more affordable but without probiotics so to each their own. Will repurchase this when there’s a sale."
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Malaysia,Excellent,A classic in my skincare kit - Have repurchased so many times. Doesn’t smell the best but keeps skin’s microbiome balanced and skin looks  and feels healthy as a result. Highly recommend
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Malaysia,It’s good,"Smells tolerable, no bad reaction and absorb fast on the face. However, I won’t recommend to use it everyday as I feel my face quite drying after everyday use. Since then, I only use this toner once in three days. "
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Singapore,Love the smell,I love the smell of vinegar and this did not disappoint. I don't use it everyday as some of my moisturisers contain AHA and I'm not sure if it would be too strong overall. A good toner nevertheless. 
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Malaysia,Did Nothing for Me,"I have blemish prone, combination skin. The slightly vinegary smell was expected, and not a dealbreaker, but this toner did absolutely nothing for me! I finished an entire bottle but did not see any change or improvement in my skin. Disappointing :("
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Singapore,not for me,Was looking for a natural and gentle toner. This one stood out as I was drawn by its ACV content. Love the Brand’s ethos but sadly the product did not do much for me. 
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Singapore,wished it worked on me,Entirely confused tbh. Is it even possible for breakouts to happen because of the toner? Isn’t probiotics supposed to be good for the skin? I’m just wondering like what went wrong..then again skincare is a journey. Might not work for me since I have sensitive acne prone oily skin.. maybe it might work out for other skins since everyone’s skin is different.
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Malaysia,So far so good,"Do not feel specially good or bad. It did not cause break out and fast absorbed. It soften the skin for the next skin regime. Will continue to use, hopefully can see better result."
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Singapore,Can’t tell,"I bought this because my usual lotion had been sold out for a couple of weeks and I had run out. I tend to break out and with my usual lotion, I break out less. With this product, it’s “break out as usual”. May work better with other people.
I’m a dry/combi skin with sensitivity to hyaluronic acid
"
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Malaysia,Mr,"it is a very mild vinegar taste like toner, however it does sweep away accumulated dead skin cells providing vibrant n radiant skin texture, love it so much, a good try from this product"
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,Malaysia,DAILY RADIANCE PEEL,"This is my second bottle. I love that it has prebiotic AND probiotic. I cant use most AHAs, my skin would turn red. With this I can enjoy benefits of an AHA since it's mild but still exfoliates a bit. Perfect for daily use but preferably use at night only. "
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,,interesting product,"I am not sure of the effect of this toner. I bought it because of the sale and interesting feature. This brand is promoting the use of enzymes in the ingredients. However i don’t really like the smell of the product, it is such a throw off for me."
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,,loving it,suitable for all skin type. I shared it with my hubby and we both loving it. would repurchase again. suitable for all skin type. I shared it with my hubby and we both loving it. would repurchase again.
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,,Stings so bad,"This stings so bad i can feel my skin heating. Used this for a week and i had breakouts on my forehead. I thought it was supposed to be gentle because it has lactobacilli, but it felt like a dose of acid on the skin. "
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,,Quite good & affordable. ,"It’s hard to come by a product w probiotics benefits on the market. It’s still fairly new. Love love the effects on my face. It’s Moisturizing alongside w all the probiotics benefits. It says vinegar, but it does not leave any stickiness on my face. Love it. Love it even more that it’s affordable. "
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,,Mr,Not really the best vinegar toner available in the market. Does the job in clearing blemishes but no significant improvement on pores. Nonetheless I’m satisfied with the results considering the price tag.
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,,Great start to Galinee skincare line,"Bought this to test out Galinee's skincare line for its emphasis on the benefits of multibiotics for skin. This is a great toner to calm down any irritation I get from my BHA blackhead liquid, because I prefer using it everyday (although it is not recommended). I use the toner after any acids during my skincare and I have noticed a difference. My skin isn't drying up after acids and the toner returns my skin to the normal pH level and I can proceed with my serums and moisturiser. Will repurchase"
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,,Face vinegar,Tried the product for a week and did noticed that skin is clearer and pores looks better. Maybe a bit drying so better to follow up with a good moisturizer. 
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,,controls my oily skin,Was apprehensive about using a toner labelled as a vinegar but results speak volumes. My skin does not become as oily during the day as before and my pimples are starting to clear up. Slightly pricey so half point off. 
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,,Probiotic!,"I'm beginning my probiotic skincare journey with this one. I'd be using this in my night routine, right after cleansing and follow up with facial oil. so far so good!"
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,,Love it,"Absolutely love this toner!! My skin is so sensitive so really picky with what I use on my skin, Feels so fresh on the skin and it really brightened my skin up! Its also helped with my break outs! love love love it :))"
GALLINÉE-Face Vinegar Toner,,Will buy another bottle once this runs out,"Will buy another bottle once this runs out. my face feels very clear and clean but not dry after using this. It is great for sensitive skin and smells really nice. I use it in the morning after waking up and in the night after showering, washing face and removing makeup. 
During mid-day if I'm at Home and my face feels oily, I use this to clean my face as well. "
LANEIGE-Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Essence Toner - For Normal To Dry Skin,Singapore,good for gift,"bought this as a gift for a mature skinned person, this brand is good to help skin keep hydrated and may be better suited for those living in non humid climates"
LANEIGE-Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Essence Toner - For Normal To Dry Skin,Singapore,Hydrating ,"This toner is great. Hydrating, yet doesn't leave a sticky residue. Will repurchase for sure."
PAI SKINCARE-Century Flower Lotus & Orange Blossom Soothing Tonic Lotion,Singapore,Soothing,"very soothing toner and love the subtle smell of freshness!
just the volume is too little so it was finished super fast, wish they had a bigger bottle"
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Singapore,Grapefruit cleansing lotion,The grapefruit is effectively remove impurities from my face with light makeup.
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Malaysia,okay,"Bought it during 50% sales, still doesn’t understand fully on the function/purpose of this. It smells nice tho. I just spray it over my face n neck when I want to look fresher up. But doesn’t know even it that works 🤣"
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Singapore,Refreshing but not special,"The product smells nice and feels refreshing but I don’t feel significant difference or special about the it which is consistent with the price. If you are looking for sth casual, this is okay!"
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Singapore,Good Exfoliating Lotion,This is a good exfoliating lotion without drying the skin too much. Price is reasonable too.
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Singapore,love mario,i am quite a fan of mario’s products because i feel that their products are more natural and contain less fragrance. skin feels clean and refreshed after using their range of skincare.
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Malaysia,ms,Its really good if your intention was to clean your makeup. Maybe not good to use as a toner. But it really clean your makeup just for one swipe! So far okay.
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Malaysia,It’s okay,"This cleansing lotion is alright. I was expecting it to have a refreshing scent (considering that it’s grapefruit) but it smells almost like a medicated product. 

It’s not a miracle. It gets the job done (although may be a tad drying for my skin, and I have oily skin) - just like any other toner I would say (there are better ones you can find)

For the price of it, I guess you get what you pay for. "
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Singapore,Fresh Cleansing Lotion,"I use this Lotion to remove the excessive makeup or residues after cleaning the skin in both morning and evening. After using it, I apply serum and moisturizer. The lotion is fresh and can control oil. I love it."
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Singapore,great for bacne ,where i’m stressed out i tend to get white heads on my back. this has definitely helped! my bacne isn’t severe so i can’t say it’ll work for really severe cases. but pairing this up with glycolic acid toner really helps. i love the scent and how gentle it is on the skin 
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Singapore,Mild toner,Bought this mistakenly as I thought it was a makeup remover rather than a toner/lotion sort of thing. The scent is pleasant but it doesn’t do anything for my skin. 
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Malaysia,Indifferent but a good stand in ,"As a stand-alone skincare step, I’m not sure if this is a groundbreaking game changer, but it is certainly effective in removing the last traces of makeup right before diving into your routine for better absorption. My skin feels extra clean with this but I think it can be a bit stripping for anyone with drier or sensitive skin. "
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Malaysia,mrs,Bought several items under this brand. Internationally standard but price is reasonable as local products. Love the face scrub and hopefully this toner make me feel better.
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Malaysia,my face feels so clean,i bought this as my p.m toner and i think it does well to my skin. i don't have any issue with the ingredient (perfume) because some of the reviews says this toner smells too strong. i would recommend for someone who has combination/oily skin to use this toner 
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Malaysia,refreshing,the toner is refreshing with a citrus smell. its also hydrating. skin feel softer after using. reduces dryness and moisturising. but the product is kind of orangy when apply to the facial cotton.
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Singapore,gentle,"I have only used this toner for a couple of weeks so far but finds it not leaving any harsh feeling on my skin. I am however disappointed with the scent. it does not have that fresh citrusy smell but will still use this toner.
"
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Malaysia,Alpha Grapefruit cleansing lotion,Another product from Mario Badescu that I have tried. I used this along with witch hazel & rosewater toner in which I use this at night and rosewater day time. I don’t see any differences of using either one of it but I love the smell though... and perhaps I feel cleaned and moisturised.. I would say any toner from MB is good so far
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Malaysia,Usual toner ,"using this for quite sometime, i feel its just a normal toner. the fragrance is too strong for me at the beginning... i dont think i will continue. rated 4 star coz it doesnt coz any breakout to my skin"
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Malaysia,Soothing,"So refreshing and definitely love the smell. Very light and I felt it does absorbed into my skin quickly. Even after i apply my moisturiser, the smell is still there. Not sticky at all. "
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Malaysia,okay product,i use this with the enzyme cleanser. been using it for a week now. so far no breakouts or whatsoever. a good amount of product for its price and will repurchase
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Singapore,It works!,"it works well for my acne prone skin. i use twice daily religiously. can see results within weeks. it last long. nice secure bottle. no need to apply a lot, I just pad it gently with my finger to all over face."
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Malaysia,Its ok,Nothing to shout about. Just a normal cleansing lotion and isn't very memorable. Used it up nonetheless as it didn't cause me any issues..A so-so product
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Singapore,does the job ,"Just a normal cleansing lotion. Gets the job done and doesn’t break me out. Worth it for the price as well. Also smells good. Other than that, nothing special! "
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,Malaysia,Citrusy Heaven,Love it so much.My skin feels so soft after applying it and i love the smell!! It smells so good!!!!!! The bottle is quite big.For me it's very affordable.Must have it. 🥰🥰
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,,Not so bad,"It’s great, love how they highlight its anti-aging properties while being less aggressive than the Glycolic one but probably won’t purchase again simply because I started looking too young after using all Mario Badescu products from cleanser, to this toner, to their mask, & eye cream. Weird right? But it’s just too much, I’m just in my late 20’s & I started to look like how I looked like when I was 16yo. Is it just me & my Asian genes? Idk but I’ll probably just stick to MB mask & eye cream after this bottle. Good buy tho, love this as an adjunct or as an every other day thing."
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,,hmm? ,Been a week since I started using this toner and I’ve only just started to notice some changes. It smells nice and doesn’t tingle on your skin and I saw no difference the first 3 days but it’s been a week now and after using the toner I find my skin kinda glowing and it’s reduced the small bumps on my skin and even noticed the fine wrinkles around my forehead started to fade. The product works but it takes a while for you to see results so just be patient. The price is reasonable because you get a full bottle that can last you a long time.
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,,love this lotion toner,"First time trying this bought the big size because seen a lot of good reviews which is true! I love the scent and when I apply on my face it leaves a smooth texture, and it feels like essence to my face, no breakouts. I think this helps to disapear my pimple marks. Will recommend this product! :D"
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,,I love it!,"Love the scent in this toner, it's very gentle and helps to moisturise my skin . It does brighten up my complexion too, I can see the results after using it a couple of times. "
MARIO BADESCU-Alpha Grapefruit Cleansing Lotion,,Not So Sure,"It feels refreshing, but unlike other toners I've used. I don't like the use of colour. I'd rather it be a colourless or naturally coloured solution. I don't know how I can say it has affected my skin as there is no difference before when I used a different toner. The smell is nice. "
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,smells weird,i don’t know if it’s just me but it smells weird. i sprayed it once and i couldn’t spray it again because of it. i plan on taking it back. normally i can get over smell but it was really bad and hurt myhead too
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Malaysia,Great toner and convenient use,Love this toner simply because it's so easy to apply. Smells great & does what it claims. Would buy it again!
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,New Zealand,"Lovely product, but overpriced ","This was a lovely product which I would love to continue using, however it loses a star because of the price point. Maybe I came into this with too-high expectations, but this product feels like glorified scented water. It smells lovely and was a great product to use during the Summer heat, but I went through my bottle so quickly because yes, I did love using it, but couldn't justify paying so much when I used mine in 4 weeks. Maybe I just use product too quickly (used twice daily) but this did not suit my personal preferences. "
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,Wonderful smell. Evaporates quickly if kept in the bathroom/shower. Doesn’t do any miracles but is a good toner.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Drying,"Cute and amazing like candies roses…however it’s very drying. It feels like an astringent more than a toner or moisturizing mist. My skin is tight and dry after use, so I wouldn’t recommend this for everyday. It doesn’t feel good. Witch-hazel itself can get me better and cheaper!"
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,Iconic. Such a lovely product. Kopari does a lovely rose-coconut scent and this toner is a personal favourite.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Singapore,Effective ,This product make my skin so smooth and soft. I saw a 'visible' difference. Most worth it to get during 20% sale. 
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Strong chemical scent,"This product smells awful. It’s a strong artificial chemical/plastic scent that is only partially masked with coconut. It works fine, but I would never purchase again due to the smell."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,"smells like roses and a little of something else, can't tell what. the scent doesn't last long at all so doesn't bother me. love how I can use it with my day and night routine without any trouble. i have extremely dry skin with oily nose. I think its a pretty good toner. no miracles but does the job."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,complexion got better,"Used one bottle, great stuff for me. I’m combination skin mostly oily. Super easy to fit into my routine and made my complexion clearer"
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Burns skin,Burns and irritates skin. My skin did not like this product at all
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Australia,MUA,"Smells amazing, clears my skin and is so soothing"
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,It does not plump my skin neither hydrate it. I am very disappointed. It makes my skin dry dry dry ! Never again…
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,"Wonderful scent. Refreshing and toning to the skin.
The bottle is so cute!"
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,"I find this toner very hydrating. It’s a little too hydrating for my current skincare routine, but I would repurchase if I didn’t have access to my regular, intensely hydrating moisturizers. 

Right now I’m actually using this on my body, and it seems to help with the acne on my back. I actually also use this as a natural deodorant, and it works surprisingly well. I feel like my underarm skin has improved; it feels smoother with less of that rough texture that comes with years of shaving. Quarantine may also be improving the texture as I shave a lot less now.

Concerning the smell, I actually like it. It smells clean and natural, which is good considering it’s fragrance free. It would smell better with some fragrance, but that would make the product less effective and skin-healthy, and I wouldn’t purchase it. It’s unfortunate that this product gets some bad reviews for something that I actually think is a bonus."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,"I don’t know why are there so many good rates of this toner that’s why I bought it, but the smell is really bad and strong and I couldn’t bear it at all."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,Smells amazing and feels great on my skin. Hydrating and refreshing.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Amazing Multi-Functional Spray,So so so good! This toner is perfect to use before/after your topical skincare product application or even for setting your makeup! It gives me the most radiant glow when I use it as a setting spray WHILE minimizing the look of my pores and pockmarks (acne scars that look like little crevasses on skin) . Certainly will be buying again.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,"A bigger, more affordable Luminous Dewy Skin Mist","If you like Tatcha's Skin Mist but don't love how small and expensive it is, this would be a great alternative. I'm not a fan of the smell, but it's tolerable."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,"Great product!!! Smells great, a tropical escape, not drying or irritating cruelty free too .  Would like to try the deo too."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,This toner smells amazing and dries quickly with no feeling on the skin. It's worked wonders for my pores and keeping the winter dryness away.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Depending on how many times I use during the day,"A number of reviews commented negatively on the scent. I don't mind scents and this is no different to me. It smells like rose and something else and it is a scent I find comforting. So far, I've used it as a replacement for my drugstore setting spray (worked well) and spritzes during the day. I found it gave me a bit of a tanned glow (I'm light olive). The first day I was a bit more conservative with the number of time I spritzed. The second, I was a bit more liberal and spritzed a few times and by late afternoon, I looked a bit shrivelled up? I am not sure if it's the witch hazel, or other environmental factors? This product for me is about balance, so I'll revert to day one usage and am so far satisfied."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,Great mist for during the day or after exercising but just ok as a toner.  Not used to spritzing toner on a cotton pad or on my face.  Nice scent but it is more floral than what I’m used to in a toning product.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,don't buy it,Hate it. The smell is too strong and my skin broke out. I have redness and it made it worse. 2 stars for it actually working for hydration.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Couldn't handle the scent,"I just couldn't handle the smell. Moisturizing enough but the rose smell just made me nauseous. It's a matter of personal preference. If you like the smell of roses, go for it. The smell dissipates after a minute; but that's too long for me personally."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,so far pleased,I don’t understand the bad reviews regarding smell. This is what pure and natural rosewater actually smells like (plus you get the coconut scent with this). And it does not linger. I’ve been using it for a few days so can’t judge long term impact but so far I like it. It didn’t break me out or irritate my skin or dry it out. Feels refreshing and a nice addition to my routine.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,The scent is nice and light. Very refreshing as primer and spritzer throughout the day.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,smell is too strong,"The mist is ok, it gives some hydration to skin. however the smell is very strong and last a long time, make me feel uncomfortable. Too bad I had to eturned it."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,this product is not good for sensitive skin. my skin doesn't feel any different. vitamin c spray form bodyshop is far much better n cheaper than this. smell is awful and its expensive too.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,soothing and comforting,"This is heavily fragranced so if that bothers you then this is not for you. However, if you do not mind fragrance it smells amazing! Coconut and rose are soothing scents for me and I use this everyday. I spray it on after washing my face and give a light spritz to set my makeup. It helps alleviate redness for me and just feels like it makes my skin happy! I do want to try other toners but I keep coming back to this. I am almost ready to accept giving into this being the one and only toner for me! If you don’t mind fragrance it is absolutely worth a try! So what are you waiting for?? Hit add to basket!"
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,way to fragranced,The product itself likely works fine I only used twice found it slightly tacky but The reason i am returning is I  get over how powerful the smell is if you like powdery floral scents ... on your face well this is for you ... not a fan at all
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,I love this toner! It's so refreshing and smells great too! Extra points for being clean as well :)
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,"I have combination skin and I’ve been using this toner for a long while now, and I can say this doesn’t do anything for me, literally. It’s not bad, but it’s not good either. It’s just... meh. Like I don’t see any difference at all whether I use it or not. Nothing has changed."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Not for acne prone skin!,"It smells great, it feels great...but made me breakout every single time...and I do not have sensitive skin. Such a disappointment :("
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,I really like this product. Yes it has a strong smell that is pretty sweet smelling but it fades quickly. If u want a quick spritz to freshen ur face up when u have all ur makeup on or ur face feels a little dry and ur too lazy to apply moisturizer- this is a great go to item. It’s 25 bucks but at a few spritzes a day - it’ll last awhile.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,like,"good toner! the scent is pretty strong, that's the only thing I don't like about it."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,the SMELL,"this smells so so strong, I can smell it hours after spraying it on my face. no noticeable benefits for my skin"
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Was Okay,"So I had bought this forever ago and my initial reaction to it was awful, it seemed to make my face breakout and so I subsequently stopped using it (I now believe it to be due to the rose ingredients in it as I find rose products tend to flare up acne for me). After some months I rediscovered it under my sink and braced myself to get break outs again upon reuse, but it ended up being ok! I found my skin tolerated it much better (I don't know if it's because it sat dormant for so long and the potency of the ingredients had died down at this point). When I did pick it up again it worked well with my skin and did all the wonderful things as advertised. So it was the definition of a hit or miss for me, being both.

I personally did not repurchase this, but perhaps it may work better for you and your skin.

Also worth noting, the coconut scent is very strong so if that isn't your cup of tea, would not recommend."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Heavy on the witch hazel,"Smell is too sweet and dries down fast than I would like in a ""soothing"" toner. Probably due to the witch hazel. Threw out about half way through since pores were looking a little larger than usual."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,overly sweet smelling,Couldn’t get past the overly sweet fragrance. It is like a super sweet candy smell.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,love this,I absolutely love how this product smells. so light & doesn’t linger too long after being sprayed.  it makes me skin feel so plump & hydrated. will definitely repurchase
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Best Toner,"Obsessed. I find myself spritzing this a few times a day as a pick-me-up. The smell is light and rosey. My face feels lovely after using this. If I feel extra dry or like a blemish is brewing, I will spritz this on my fingers and pat in vs just spritzing on my face. Works like a charm!"
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,lovely vanilla coco rose scent,"This smells lovely and delicate and is a nice refresher during the summer. I keep it in my fridge. The mist could be a little finer, but I’m picky and have high expectations when it comes to facial mists- LOL. I adore Caudalie beauty elixir and Lilah B’s Aglow mist but I am underwhelmed but Tatcha luminous dewy skin mist (which everyone loves)... so if you know what I mean, you’d likely love this mist. And it has clean ingredients, it’s not too expensive, and will last awhile. Note: I don’t use as a setting spray- I use as part of my skincare routine and as a midday pick me up - barely been wearing makeup the last several months so I don’t know how this rates as a setting spray."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Australia,nice,I do like this hydrating spray but I think I'll use it more in summer! it is good to use as a fresh up during the day to keep your face hydrated and make up looking and sitting nice on the skin :)
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,Love this product. Light and refreshing. The scent is relaxing.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Absolutely love this toner,"I was searching for a new toner, and landed on this one after reading the reviews on Sephora's website.  I wanted something that had the ""Clean at Sephora"" stamp, which this has.  I love that I can just use a spritz or two on my face and neck without having to use wasteful cotton pads.

It has a great smell and texture.  It's very light and doesn't leave a sticky residue on my skin.  It's very refreshing.  For reference, I have sensitive, combination skin."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Australia,overpriced,this product is nice but it is full of witch-hazel which is a cheap ingredient and not too good for your skin. plus the product has coconut oil in it which also isnt too good. 
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Australia,Nothing special,The smell is more rose than coconut and not great but not too terrible. Doesn't do much overall. I have tried better toners and setting sprays and won't be using it any more.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,I bought a Sephora Favourites with a sample size of this in it two years ago and i have been repurchasing this product since then. leaves my skin feeling hydrated and i see a difference with how my other skin care absorbs into my face.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,strong scent,"Not a bad product at all just very strong scent, a little too overpowering for my liking. It’s not a bad smell, just strong for something going on my face and scent lingers throughout the day. It is very cooling though and I love using it as a face primer before makeup."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,"i don’t love the smell of this toner... the rose scent mixed with coconut is too sweet. it also leaves a slightly sticky texture to my skin after using. i love kopari, but not this product."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Not sure what to make of it.,"I like this product but I can’t say it’s doing anything for me. I can’t say my face looks any different with it. Smells nice and I like the mist, but not sure it’s doing anything."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Great Product!,"At first I was hesitant, having a rose and a coconut product all in one. But they work really well! I usually use this in the morning after washing my face. And the evening before bed. During the summer it is my go to because it leaves my face cool and relaxed. I usually spray it on my face. No drying up of the skin and it also doesn't leave my skin oily as I have combination skin."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,"Third bottle of this!  I can’t finish my makeup without it!  I use as a setting spray, let dry, then take a loose kabuki brush and lightly buff everything so I look more natural.  Even had a coworker comment how lucky I am to only need mascara and lipstick since I have “perfect skin”.  Haha.  This takes it from “made up” to naturally flawless.  Can’t be without it!"
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,So-so,"I love Kopari products, but this is one I can definitely live without. The scent wasn’t my favorite; I thought it smelled like cupcake. It feels refreshing like most face sprays, but just didn’t seem to have any sort of impact on my skin. In my opinion, not worth having in your cabinet."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,My one and only toner!,"No drying alcohols, no artificial fragrance, and a good price? Sign me up! This product helps balance skin's sebum production with witch hazel without overly drying the skin thanks to the many hydrating ingredients. And the product is 5.1 oz, so you get a good amount of product for the price. I recommend you give it a try~"
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Australia,Love it! ,The smell is amazing yet not overpowering and my skin feels so good and fresh after using it.  This toner lives in my gym bag.  If only it came in a smaller more compact size.  
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,Love this product! After my go-to toner was discontinued I decided to try out Kopari. My only time using their products prior was when I use their deodorant and I really was not a fan so I was a bit hesitant. This toner absolutely changed my opinion of the brand! It is so gentle and leaves my skin feeling buttery smooth. The smell is fantastic- as if you are in a beach front spa. It doesn’t smell like baby powder in the least it smells like beautiful fragrant coconut with a hint of floral. If you are looking for a gentle toner this is going to be the best pic you find.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Fantastic Product,I’ve tried a few toners like The Ordinary and Lush brands but this is my fave. It feels for luxurious on the skin. When applied it feels like velvet. It smells heavenly and it’s so great on my skin. This is an amazing product for the price point.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,A very versatile product,This is a nice refreshing product and I love to use it on days when I'm feeling lazy because it's so convenient. Spray bottle toners are my go-to when I'm exhausted. This one smells great and can be used multiple ways. You can use it as a setting spray or to refresh your face throughout the day. It's extremely affordable and the packaging is really pretty.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Worth repurchasing...,Repurchasing this because it has become one of my fav toners. I switch between this and Mario B. toner. So glad to pick this up during the spring sale.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Worked for my sensitive skin!,"Gentle toner, but it still gets all my leftover make up off after cleansing! Definitely recommend. Just purchased my second bottle!"
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Caused breakouts,"Got this in my boxycharm premium box a few months ago and decided to try it out since I ran out of my Mario Badescu rose mist. I was weary of using a product with coconut oil in it on my face but decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, it made me break out and it smells like baby powder."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,avoid if you have sensitive skin + rosacea,"I don't know why but this product made me break out all over my cheeks. I have sensitive skin and rosacea, so if you do too you should avoid this product.
 I gave it to a friend and they liked it. It has a nice smell."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,"love this stuff. I never break out anymore after adding this to my routine, the benzoyl peroxide wash I use (only once a day!) dries my skin out so much! but this stuff refreshes my skin and it feels perfectly balanced afterward, especially after moisturizing. holy grail for sensitive & dehydrated, combination skin"
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Excellent toner,"I switched to this when Sephora stopped carrying my beloved Herbivore Botanicals Rose Hibiscus Hydrating Face Mist. It works just as well for me. I use this every morning as the first step in my routine. It is refreshing, smells great, I like the way it feels, and it really helps balance my combination skin. I also think it helps my serums absorb better."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Sensitive skin warning but smells great,"I have combination sensitive skin, this was way to strong for my face but it smells soooo good! I was breaking out like crazy. I wish I could use this on my face but I actually just apply to neck and body for a hydrating perfume mist.. then apply unscented lotion to seal it in. I like for this purpose only though."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smells great! Highly recommend for people with dry skin!
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Definitely recommend.,"Seriously amazing. Smells lovely, super refreshing, keeps me dewy all day"
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,I love love love this toner! I always have a back up of it. Smells amazing and makes my skin feel so nice.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,Perfect as a glowy primer as well as a spray to dampen your beauty blender to make any application more glowy.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,"My favorite thing about this toner is the scent.  While I haven't notice any skin benefits, I love the scent."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,I am on my second bottle. I absolutely love this product. The smell is amazing.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,meh,It hasn't done anything for my skin. It is like spraying perfume on your face.  It does have the tendency to burn if I have used adapalene or benzyl peroxide the day before.  I was using it to add extra moisture to my face but my skin still feels super tight and dry after using this.  The smell is nice and doesn't linger but I just can't see myself buying another bottle.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Caused breakouts,"I really loved this product at first, it removes redness perfectly and hydrates well too, I used first bottle in one month and got another one. Second bottle caused multiple breakouts in a half of a month of using. Probably it happened because of coconut oil in it, so be aware"
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,My Favorite!!,"I’ve tried so many face mists and toners. I wanted something that I could feel working on my skin but something that also hydrated it. This is it! I love the scent, I love the amount of product, and most importantly I love how it makes my skin feel."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,Leaves my face feeling refreshed and moist.  Does not dry out my skin and smells great too!
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,I'm addicted.,"I use this everyday, multiple times per day. It's my absolute favorite toner ever."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,,Refreshing spray toner,"This is my 3rd bottle. I love the fact that I can spray the toner instead of pouring it out. Smells wonderful, makes my face feels fresh after cleansing. No dramatic change, but I notice it helps balance my skin. "
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,,Coconut Rose Toner,"Feels very refreshing yet gentle on my skin. I have found it does reduce redness as it says. The spray bottle means less waste, and the spray dries quickly.
"
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,yuuummm,The best smelling spray toner ever!  Makes me happy to spray all times during the day!
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Refreshing,"I have to start with the scent, it's so delicious with rose and sweet combination that triggers my childhood memory and makes me feel refreshed. It also hydrates my (dry/ normal) skin and calming it after sun exposure.
I love it in general for summer but I don't think I'll use it for fall and winter."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Rose Rose Rose,This toner removes left over dirt and refreshes my face. It has a strong rose scent that’s why the four star rating.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,,good for redness!!,"I have noticed that my redness lessened, true to what it claims. However, it doesn't have any brightening effects, which I also look for a toner. Really good if your main concern is redness."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,Canada,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,I love the idea of having toner in a spray bottle but I HATE the smell. It’s like a mix of rose and bubblegum. I wouldn’t mind it that much if it was a subtle scent but it’s like spraying perfume on your face. I’m returning it.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,,Coconut Rose Toner,"This toner is super refreshing and it smells all coconutty! It has a little sticky feel to it a few second after application but the sticky feel only last a few seconds! If you have sensitive skin, you might want to be cautious but I would totally recommend this product!"
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,,lovely,"I got this after seeing some videos on YouTube. lovely light scent, it does freshen up my skin and dries up quickly. packaging is awesome too, I love the spray so I don't need to use cotton pads or my hands to apply. "
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Best smelling toner,My favorite toner! The smell is amazing! And I love the mister.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,absolutely must have,"This product is all that was promised. I have combination skin. Rose water and coconut are exactly what my skin needed. Apart from a very delicate scent, it is very gentle for my skin and is great for preparing skin for a serum, face cream or a sheet mask. I am recommending it to everyone. Side note for the producer: please introduce a mini size without value set. I travel a lot and every time, I need to put the product in a smaller bottle by spraying it into it."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Amazing Toner,Hydrating and refreshing. This toner is beautiful as a skin care step but is also great over top of makeup (super fine mist!). Love that this product is vegan and cruelty-free.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,,Fresh,"Use it pre/post makeup application or just as a barefaced refresher. The scent is nice. Not a holy grail product, but would definitely own its place on your skincare shelf."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Lovely,"This is a lovely toner. I love that it is a spray. The nozzle is a little funky on mine, so I don't get a clean mist (there is like one spot on my face that gets blasted). Honestly that's fine though. I don't know if all the bottles are like that. But I always start my night-time skincare routine with this, so in my mind who cares if I get a little more on my face? It does smell like coconuts and roses and it's very soft smelling. I don't think I will repurchase just because I discovered the Thayers Facial Toner in Rose which I adore and it's a bit cheaper. Although this is very fairly priced in my opinion. If you're interested, I'd say try it out."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Hydrating and smells sooo good,"I lovelovelovelove this coconut rose toner. My husband loves the smell so much, he started using it as well. It is so hydrating and I swear we both have a glow from regular use. It doesn't leave a sticky film but it does need time to dry before you move on to the next step. Totally worth it! I also use it on top of my makeup, for the hydration, on my very dry days. It's a regular in my regimen and I keep an extra bottle on hand."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Yet another great product,This is definitely one of my favorite spray toners. Most spray toners have a bit of a harsh spray but this one is soft and moisturizing. It feels so good falling on to the skin and Kopari has yet again made another great product.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Simply wonderful,With just one pump you notice the top note is rose followed by coconut scent...divine indulgence. Feels refreshing and light. Pamper yourself.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,Très bien! il sent super bon et très bon rapport qualité prix
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,Not very hydrating. Face feels dry again a few minutes after spraying. This toner makes it difficult to apply face cream and primer.
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,LOVE,"I LOVE this product. It's hydrating, the mist is beautiful and the smell is amazing. It also works as a beautiful makeup spray that melts all the powder into the skin."
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Kopari Coconut Rose Toner,"I don’t usually write reviews BUT I had to, ive tried many many products out there and was always missing that extra hydration no matter what routine I was using, I decided to purchase this along with the kopari coconut moisturizer so I can use together, let me say WOW! What a difference I’ve seen in my skin, it’s more hydrated, more smooth, it reduced my redness on my skin( I’m also currently pregnant so my skin has broken out and using this has calmed my skin) once I finish a product I usually like to change and try new products but I will def be repurchasing this little wonder along with the Moisturizer, it smells great my skin feels refreshed and best of all it’s clean :)"
KOPARI-Coconut Rose Toner,USA,Love it!!,"My skin has gotten very sensitive as I’ve gotten older so for awhile I stopped using toners as they were too harsh or made me breakout. Decided to give this a try because of the clean label and word of mouth. So happy I did, my skin looks amazing. Refreshed and more even. Obsessed. Love the scent! (I can no longer use scented items so it’s nice to have something smell nice that I can use!!)"
CLINIQUE-Clarifying Lotion 1 - Very Dry To Dry Skin,Singapore,great toner,"Barely has any scent which is great to clean or tone your face before or after make up. 
I normally use this at night before I apply any cream, and it’s really soothing on the skin"
CLINIQUE-Clarifying Lotion 1 - Very Dry To Dry Skin,Singapore,Great Toner for Dry & Sensitive Skin,"Just emptied this, works more like a refreshing toner than a moisturising one. If you are looking for a more moisturising one the clinique moisture surge lotion is definitely more moisturising compared to this. Always love Clinique as they are suitable for sensitive skin. Giving this a 4.5 because of the usage of cotton pad every time I apply on."
CLINIQUE-Clarifying Lotion 1 - Very Dry To Dry Skin,Malaysia,ok la,Sesuai untuk kulit kering...saya mempunyai kulit berminyak..jadi x berape sesuai untuk kulit saya...tapi masih boleh pakai..jerawat kurang naik...bagus untuk kulit yang mempunyai masalah kulit kering
CLINIQUE-Clarifying Lotion 1 - Very Dry To Dry Skin,Singapore,light and non-drying toner,"I have been using this toner for almost 5 years. Been a fan of Clinique for awhile. I like that this toner somehow helping to reduce pimple, and non-drying."
ALPHA-H-Clear Skin Tonic with 2% Salicylic Acid,New Zealand,Awesome,"I love using this, it is pricey however does wonders for the skin "
ALPHA-H-Clear Skin Tonic with 2% Salicylic Acid,Australia,nice,"I used this product for a long time. It works really well and helps to give glow on your lips. I want to say, it’s worth the price. And I’ll be buying this product. "
ALPHA-H-Clear Skin Tonic with 2% Salicylic Acid,Australia,best,"I have oily skin and hormonal cystic acne on my jaw line. This product after a week banished the small pimples I had on my face and reduced my cystic acne by half. I love the smell, it’s clinical but feels expensive. I recommend to any one with pesky acne. It is a bit pricey but for me if I can control even 10% of my hormonal acne with this, it’s worth it! "
ALPHA-H-Clear Skin Tonic with 2% Salicylic Acid,Australia,Perfect Toner,"Love this toner for oily skin, it sunk in so fast and didn't leave my skin feeling sticky (which a lot of salicylic toners have) used this under my face oil and noticed my skin felt so smooth and instantly less red "
ALPHA-H-Clear Skin Tonic with 2% Salicylic Acid,New Zealand,LOVE,"I live for this stuff, it has been a game changer for me with my combination skin. My skin just looks so much healthier taking this extra little step in my skincare routine. I just wish it wasn’t so expensive! "
ALPHA-H-Clear Skin Tonic with 2% Salicylic Acid,Australia,over powering,"It was so over powering, don’t use if you have sensitive skin, very drying and doesn’t go well if you wear a lot of makeup. If you suffer from acne it does nothing "
ALPHA-H-Clear Skin Tonic with 2% Salicylic Acid,Australia,clean and fresh,I love this toner so much!! Gets rid of any left over dirt or makeup after cleansing and just leaves your skin feeling tighter and cleaner then ever. Pairs really well with the hydration moisturiser.  
ALPHA-H-Clear Skin Tonic with 2% Salicylic Acid,New Zealand,Great!,Been using this for around two weeks and I’ve noticed a big improvement in my acne. Heads up- very strong tea tree smell. I use it at night prior to serums and moisturisers etc as it leaves a bit of a film during the day and I’m not sure how makeup would go over it but- all in all- will repurchase 100%. Its great. 
ALPHA-H-Clear Skin Tonic with 2% Salicylic Acid,Australia,clear skin tonic ,"First alpha-h product that I’ve tried, it’s gentle and non irritating on sensitive skin, like the herbal almost like medicine smell. Not sure about the price tag considering it’s a toner "
ALPHA-H-Clear Skin Tonic with 2% Salicylic Acid,Australia,Too drying ,This tonic is extremely drying on the skin and it’s got a very strong tee tree scent. I couldn’t use it more than twice because it made my skin very dry and irritated. Very disappointed! 
ALPHA-H-Clear Skin Tonic with 2% Salicylic Acid,Australia,Light and gentle,A great every day chemical exfoliant. Very gentle with no stinging or burning. Works well for every day use in combination with stronger exfoliants on alternate days.
ALPHA-H-Clear Skin Tonic with 2% Salicylic Acid,Australia,Clear Skin,"I have only recently started using Alpha-H Skincare after getting a few samples. It is one of the best brands I have tried. I have combo skin, normal-dry and an oily t-zone. There is definitely a huge difference even in the short amount of time of using it - my hormonal and stress breakout is basically gone which is so unusual and awesome!"
ALPHA-H-Clear Skin Tonic with 2% Salicylic Acid,,Obsessed!,This has cleared up my skin so quickly! I use it along with my other Alpha H products and they all work hand in hand to clear up my skin and make it feel and look so fresh
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Australia,Love it,"Feels very refreshing, my skin feels extra clean after using it and it doesn’t dry out my skin. Only minus half a star because it’s a tiny bit expensive despite not having additional benefits/active ingredients."
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Australia,Love it,"Feels very refreshing, my skin feels extra clean after using it and it doesn’t dry out my skin. Only minus half a star because it’s a tiny bit expensive despite not having additional benefits/active ingredients."
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Malaysia,Hydrating toner!,"I bought this product after hearing good reviews online. It hydrates my skin pretty well after cleansing, unlike other toners containing alcohol which leaves my skin a little more dry for some reason. I just purchased a larger bottle. Can’t wait to use it again! "
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Singapore,I love this.. holy grail,"I have been using Pixi's milky tonic since 2020 and I love it so much. It is hydrating, doesn't leave my skin feeling tight in between applying serums. When I found out that Sephora was selling the 250ml version, I immediately snagged it. I'm on my second 250ml bottle and I think it is worth the $48."
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Malaysia,loveee,i love pixi skincare range. i decided to try their mily tonic which i found suitable for my sensitive skin. it is soothing and hydrating at the same time. didnt sting my skin
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Singapore,my night toner,I like to use this toner for my night routine as it feels moisturising enough yet not too oily. Gives a refreshing feel. Occasionally I switch it up with some other toners. 
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Singapore,Hydrating ,"A nice comfortable hydrating tonic to use. Out of the full range from Pixi, I still love the glow tonic the most though."
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Singapore,amazing product,"Really love how this feels on my skin, bought it with an additional 20% off as it was 10.10 sale. Really worth it and it is hydrating to my skin as well, i use it day and night
"
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Singapore,okay toner,I just wanted an alcohol free hydrating toner with no any direct acids and bought this. I like it. It doesn’t dry out my skin. I use this after my cleanser only on the days when i put makeup on. 
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Malaysia,breaks me out,"I didn’t know what to expect from this toner as I’m just looking to try new ones. I’m surprised it’s scented, but it broke me out sadly. Maybe because I have sensitive skin too."
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Australia,good for winter ,It’s a nice hydrating toner for cooler weather when my skin needs more moisture. I love Pixi line and I find it to be effective and affordable. Will repeat 
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Singapore,Does not irritate skin,"I have very sensitive skin and this product generally does not cause any breakout, tear or inflammation to my face which is great. However, I do not find much differences in my skin condition (eg no glow or anything) after using this."
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Malaysia,2nd purchase ,"This is my second purchase. I really like it. After using it, my skin looks moisture and great. Before that, my skin looks dry. Can you upgrade the volume to 250ml, I really appreciate that."
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Malaysia,Mild to skin,Bought this since I need a mild toner to be used with BHA for my morning routine. Does the job well just that the smell isn't the best. It reminds me of chinese herbal
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Singapore,nahhh,Don’t see any effect. I breakout even more than usual. I think the other normal one is better even tho it stings. Price is too high for such a small bottle. 
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Singapore,Good product,"I used the glow tonic for my first purchase from Pixi. It was pretty good & when I found this milky tonic for oily skin, i decided to try. It controlled the oil quite well. "
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Malaysia,Nice product,Bought this to try it whether suits me or not. Luckily it suits my skin. I use it everyday day and night. No redness or pores occur after using it and my skin feel hydrated. Will repurcase.
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Malaysia,❤️❤️❤️,So far my face is having no problem w this toner but i would be please if they can bring in the big bottle. The big bottle is 250ml compared to small 100ml. I would probably but the big bottle twice as much 
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Singapore,Leaves skin smooth and moisturised ,Tried other Pixi products before and think this is my favourite! Leaves skin smooth and moisturised after each use and is gentle on skin. Only downside is the smell takes some getting used to. 
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Malaysia,okay toner,Not a bad toner to use. But don’t think I’ll repurchase it. I do enjoy using it but somehow I think I prefer other toner. Must remember to shake the toner before use
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Singapore,Gr8,"Been using this for a year now, i must say this is the toner i could go for. but i really hope they have a bigger bottle so i dont really have to keep purchase it... Good for sensitive skin and i use this with a facial mist. it works i guess. i could continue to purchase it till they have a bigger bottle. "
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Australia,Milky tomic,"I ordered this milky tonic instead of any of the pother options because i’m not sure if they feel oily and i hate the oily feel, how ever this one feels really nice and refreshing, and smells good. "
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Singapore,Good for sensitive and acne prone skin.,"This milky formulae is gentle and yet does the job well. My son has acne prone skin and this toner tone down his redness and clear up his skin fast. But the size (100ml) offered on the website is too small, pls bring in the bigger size bottle."
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Australia,love it,I love this toner. It was a new release so I wasn’t sure whether or not to get it. Best decision I ever made. My complexion is so different compared to before my skin feels way better now 
PIXI-Milky Tonic,Singapore,Refreshing,"Refreshing scent and super fast absorbent, leaves skin plump and hydrated, it is clear, the bottle makes it look cloudy, a little amount is enough, I use it with my hands and not cotton 
"
PIXI-Milky Tonic,,best toner in my life lol,i love the scent and it makes my face feel clean and refreshed ! it doesn't burn my skin and i really feel that it can clear any last remnants of my makeup just in case i did not wash off my makeup properly
PIXI-Milky Tonic,,ms,"Haven’t tried the milky tonic yet, but I’m a fan of their glow tonic and retinol tonic. Hope this is as equally good as the other pixi products!!!!!!!"
PIXI-Milky Tonic,,The best toner,"Great toner from pixi! It does not harsha to our skin, great for everyday use. Try it today, pixi have great products for healthy and glow skin. I trust all pixi products"
PIXI-Milky Tonic,,"mild, moisturizing toner","this is a very mild and moisturizing toner i shall say. i use the pixi glow tonic at nite and this one in the morning. it smells lovely and really moisturize the skin after cleansing. if you have sensitive and dry skin, this toner is great for you "
PIXI-Milky Tonic,,new ,"I like this product a lot, still trying to decide the best way to use and and what with. I’m hoping to get more information on this and all formulas - to find what’s best for my skin. But so far it has been pretty helpful as long as I don’t over use it and really moisturize afterwards. 
"
PIXI-Milky Tonic,,soothing,This is my second purchase. Pixi products are always a hit or miss for me. This toner is a hit. it's very soothing and calm down my acne prone skin. worth the buy 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,not bad ,this is quite a moisturising toner and has very nice rose scent. it is also a good product if you have sensitive skin. this toner doesn't give me breakouts
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,Good buy,Smoothes the face and allows makeup to spread well after. Nice smell. Was using pixi retinol but this is much better. Skin feels soft and smooth after use.
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,meh,I read so many great reviews on this toner but it doesn’t work for me. Instead it caused breakout on my skin and the texture is sticky. I have opt to use it once a week for face and more on my keens and elbows
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,Lovely for sensitive skin,"I first got this as a gift a few years ago. Bought it again when I was looking for a gentle, soothing toner. This product really helps to soothe skin and I found that it reduced redness. It's refreshing and has a lovely scent"
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,meh,"it was ok. smelt nice and felt some tingly fresh sensations but didn't didn't a huge difference in my skin. that being said, I jever really do with tonics and toners."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,rose tonic,Pixi rose tonic with rose essence is really pleasant to the nose and it does not irritate my skin. It cleanses my skin really well too. Will buy the bigger size next.
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,idk,"the smell is quite nice and feels refreshing when applied to the face. skin feels light and has a glowy effect after applying. 
I points so yes........"
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Australia,love it so much!,"finished it so quickly because I use it 2 times a day! too bad it always sold out everytime I comeback. very gentle on skin, no sharp smell, just suit my skin so well. "
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,good,Great product…make my skin clean after using cleanser. Pixi really good product and recommended…. Really enjoy during use this toner. It come out all dirty in my skin. 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,Love it!,"This is a good toner. i love the smell, it doesnt sting and does it’s job reasonably well. compared to the other ranges under pixi’s tonic, this is one of the best."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,Game changer!,I have a very dry sensitive skin. I've been using this for the past 3 years and my skin is never in a bad condition! I paired this toner with overnight glow serum! works perfectly! recommended!
PIXI-Rose Tonic,New Zealand,Not much impact on my skin,I would prefer to get the other variant which evidently you’ll see the glowing effect on your skin unlike with this one. Will still continue using this though. But not buying another bottle again.
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,Soft and gentles,I use this in my night skincare routine and this is my third bottles. Feels very very soft and gentle when i pat onto my face. Has a subtle smell of rose which is ok for me. 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,Nice product ,This hydrates my face and leaves a nice rose scent. Enjoy using it but I guess that’s all. A good alternative to those fancy expensive toner. This does the job as well.
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Australia,water,0 star mm no 🙄🙄 I think it’s pointless just like putting water nil benefit possible gimmick or trendy toner.. don’t recommend at all don’t waste your money or time
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,Highly recommended,Its very good tonic and highly recommended for those oily/ combination skin. I like the smell and texture of the tonic as well. It asborbs well into my skin.
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Australia,not good for sensitive skin ,"My only criticism is that the scent isn’t very suitable for those with sensitive skin! I had to stop using it eventually as it was giving me mild red irritation, and generally made my skin tone quite patchy. For those with normal skin, I’m sure it would work fine. Just a forewarning for my fellow sensitive skin ppl."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Australia,Pixi Rose Tonic ,This tonic is nice but for the price I’ve used better ones that are much less expensive. It has a lovely smell but that’s about the extent of it. I’ve used other products in the range which I really like so I was surprised when this didn’t deliver. 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,Ms,"i use the rose tonic toner to hydrate my skin before heading out to work and after i get back from a hard days work, it smells good and really works well with sesitive skin."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,Love it! ,"It smells really good and leaves my skin smooth and non-sticky 😍 But i wish the volume could increase more, i finished it in 3 weeks, it's kinda quick. Overall is a good product. "
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,Pixi Rose Tonic,Love this product as it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin and leave my face feel moisturised. I’ll definitely gonna repurchase this again after I’ve finished with this. 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,not suitable for dry skin,"this toner was just meh. don't think it's suitable for dry skin. Overall did not work well for me, but I think it may work for others with more oily skin."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Australia,beautiful rose water,"It beautiful rise water that will hydrate your skin, look after the pores it does have a strong fragrance so if fragrance is not your thing keep you may want to keep this one out of your vanity I personally don't mind it... It looked after my skin well"
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,Ms,"This product have a very concentrated scent of rose smell. If for those who loves scented, this may be a recommended product for you. But due to the scent, I have stop using after a few times."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Australia,Great toner!,I used this after noticing breakouts of tiny spots around my mouth and cheek and using this every morning has completely stopped these! My skin is generally much smoother and this toner cleans my skin without drying me out. Smells great too :)
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,Smells Good,"This definitely smells good, not overpowering. Works ok on the skin and not too harsh. Nothing much to gush about. A bit pricey for its just-okay performance. Go for Thayers’ if you’d want something similar but less expensive. "
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,Average,"it smells good, very faint rose smell which i like. dries up pretty well on the skin. but that just it. its not that bad, but not great either. just average. basic. there is cheaper rose toner that has better performance. won’t repurchase but glad i’ve tried it."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,My Morning Bestie,I never start my day without a splash of PiXi Rose Tonic. I love the way it smells and makes my skin hydrated in seconds. very good for dry n ageing skin as it helps in balancing the pH of skin instantly. love it and recommend. 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,New Zealand,100ml toner,Its not a bad product but I don't find it extremely hydrating so I didn't give it a higher rating. I dont think I will purchase this again because there is a very strong scent. Wish it just wasn't that strong 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,pixi rose tonic,My skin felt rough and parched after using it under my usual serum and moisturiser. Maybe i need something more hydrating. The scent is a nice rose fragrance which i quite like. 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,Ms,So far so good. The rose smell is pretty strong but when used on skin it dissapears. I have not had any breakout when using good so that’s okay for now. 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,love it,"Been using it for a few months now. Fragrance of the rose scent is lovely and mild, hasn’t caused me any problems so far in my current routine with other products. Will recommend."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,New Zealand,S good,I purchased a small bottle to try it out as I have never used pixi products before but i am very impressed. Love the smell its not too strong which is nice. 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,Pixi Rose Toner,Love this product! It's a game changer in my skincare routine. It smells just nice; not so over powered. I would be glad if you get a big bottle in house too. 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,My Daily Toner,I have been using the rose tonic every since and i would totally recommend it for those who is having a sensitive skin like mine..i does wonder and does not have that tingling after feeling that some toner mighy have!
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,The best toner so far,"I first tried this toner when I redeemed my points for the deluxe sample. I noticed that my skin looked more radiant when using this toner. Then I was trying out other toners but was not happy with the results as they didn't make any difference. So I bit the bullet and bought this toner. Immediately I can notice much improvements to my skin. Pores are less visible, skin looks and feel firmer, and overall my face looks more radiant. Best to stock up during sale."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,not overly rose smelling,"Have never been a fan of rose, but after reading reviews on Pixi and its line of toners I decided to try it. It’s pleasant smelling, not pungently rose, and feels refreshing on my skin. Just started using it, may consider repurchasing. "
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Australia,love it,Smells like heaven and is super gentle on my skin! It absorbs quickly and feels great after application. Only used a week but I am very happy so far. ...
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,Pixi Rose Tonic,"This helps to tone, balance pH, minimize redness and calm skin. It's alcohol free which I prefer with my skin sensitivities. This has a very strong rose scent (to me). "
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Australia,yumm,smells amazing and it does an amazing job clearing excess dirt from the pores and leaves face smelling absolutely gorgeous like actual roses. would definitely buy again 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,soothing & hydrating,a very good toner. it is soothing and very hydrating. love how it leaves my skin so moist yet not wet. a definite must try besides their glow tonic. I use this as part of my night time routine. few drops on my palm and I press it into my skin. 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,Smells good,"I love the smell, very fresh but not the result. I have been using about half of the bottle but nothing change. Glow tonic is better than this.  Not going to buy again."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,pixi rose tonic,"The rose scent is a little strong for me, something like a weak perfume. The first week of using it made my skin oilier than usual but after that it really hydrated my skin and made it feel plump and soft. I don't use a cotton pad i just shake it twice on my palms and pat it on my face "
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,Like it but not love it,"I love that it nourishes & makes my skin supple while toning it. Overall, just a basic toner with a light rosy scent. At least it doesnt let my skin have any breakouts. so that's a plus point! Would love Pixi to have more energizing properties in their products, with more goodness packed in  a bottle which elevates our skin care experience. (:"
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,Rose Tonic,Gentle toner that works well on my dry and sensitive skin. Been using Mamonde Rose Toner previously and this would be a good alternative. Wished that it could come in a larger bottle though.
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,smell was really pleasant!,"bought this to try when i was in australia, it is really hydrating on the skin & smells really good! however, only giving 4.5 stars cos they do not have the big bottle in sg :( "
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Australia,amazing,This pixi rose  tonic is amazing I love it mostly I use it in the morning it’s rose fragrance is so good so real and this toner gives glow to ur skin I am loving it now a days 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,love the smell,First reason i try this because i love rose. Nice smell. Light texture. Can be oily after long time to my combination skin. But can see a little glowing effect after few days. 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,I don't get it ,"No difference on my face whatsoever, I used it for almost a month, and can't really say if it's good or bad for my skin, cause it doesn't seem any difference than before I start using it. I don't like the smell, btw. I usually like rose anything smell, but not this, it's weird. "
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,smells divine,"I use this product during the day as a gentle toner, and the pixi glo tonic at night. It’s been great at clarifying my skin, plus it smells so good! Definitely a good buy"
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Australia,great!,"I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this toner is great. It doesn’t sting or make my skin red when I use it and still works. Definitely my new staple toner"
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,YES! ,"The soothing texture it leaves on your skin and the soothing scent, it’s a winning combination. It’s helped with the redness my skin is prone too. Will definitely purchase again. "
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,Amazing smell ,"It has a very nice and fresh rose smell. Will not dry my face, I always use it directly without cotton pad , and pat into my skin. Small and handy suitable for buy it as a travel pack ."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,Toner,"Been using this for few days. Able to remove the residual of the make up and I love the smell of it. 
Rose lovers might love this. 
It is affordable but I wished that I got a larger volume of the toner. "
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,Rose tonic,Fresh smell and does the job. Not the best toner for sensitive skin as it can be a little too harsh on skin if applied too much but overall its worth the price.
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Australia,awesome for sensitive skin,"I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this toner is great. No stinging because it’s alcohol free but still works. Will buy this product again in the bigger size."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,Love this!,A very refreshing toner that is rose scented. The smell is not empowering at all and toner leaves my skin feeling fresh and ready for serums and creams. Would definitely get this again.
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,basic toner,"It's gives off a very nice scent which tempts you to use it. It does not give off a refreshing feeling and therefore consider it as a basic toner for anyone. Possibly suitable for Normal skin. A travel friendly size, recommend for travelling!!"
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Australia,first time use,So good is my first time to use it. After use it for a few week I noticed that my skin getting smooth and i love a smell of the rose so much will buy it again
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,I loved the smell!!,"I was planning so long to purchase this rose tonic.. Because Im a rose lover and the smell of course.. After the cleaser , I apply this with a cotton and I feel my skin so soft and hydrating! I will use this my entire life.... Light n soft.."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,tiny bumps appeared,"Personally not suitable for my 30 y/o, Malay, combination skin. After only one use, tiny bumps started to appear on my cheeks. I never thought I had sensitive skin until I tried this particular rose product. Never had problems with other rose products from other brands before."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,MAGIC but slower hehe.,Ive to agree the smell is really nice but the changes is slower than the Glow tonic. Idk maybe bcs i dont use it as often as the flow tonic but wtv it is i will still try again bcs so far so good it does minimize the redness! 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Australia,Lovely,"This is a fantastic PH balancing toner. 
Has a nice soft subtle fragrance and easy to use. I would probably get this again. Helps prepare my skin for my regimen."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,Not for me,"This toner smells alright.
I thought it's suitable for sensitive skin and it's supposed to minimize redness and calm skin but my skin feels itchy and there are more redness and breakouts after using :(
I would not repurchase as it's not suitable for me."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,works great!,"It smells very natural and refreshing. A little bit goes a Long way. My skin feels more refined after use. Previously I was using fresh rose water toner, and I find this has the same effect and has better value for money"
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Australia,Great for sensitive skin!,"I absolutely love the Pixi Rose range, I have very sensitive skin and this range has worked wonders for my skin! I use the Pixi rose cleanser, tonic and flash balm in the morning and the Pixi Retinol range at night :) my skin has become so much more smooth, soft and clear. Love Pixi!!! And it’s a cruelty free company :) "
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Singapore,gentle yet powerful,Gentle yet powerful toner. The price is rather affordable as well and the choice for the volume is good. This rose version comes with a slight fragrance but nothing too strong. 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Australia,Smells beautiful,"I absolutely love the smell of this toner. I have combination skin and this one is quite mild and and refreshing. I use this at night time and Ole Henriksen Balancing Force oil control toner in the morning. I feel like the O/H one works better for my skin, but it's a pleasant and moisturising one to use before bed."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,Malaysia,Rose Tonic,A great hydrating toner for sensitive skin with a nice scent. I use the Rose Toner in the morning and the Glow Tonic at night for a hydrated and glowy skin. 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,Pixi Rose Tonic,Nice product and I have no problem using it. Not going to repurchase because it is a bit pricey for me. I would rather invest in nice serum or moisturizer. 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,Subtle Rose Scent and Doesn't Dry Skin out,"Was worried that the toner would make my skin taut and dry. But WOW! Love the size, and you only need a little to go a long way. It really glides onto your skin smoothly and it is subtle and mild. Keeps the oiliness at bay, too. "
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,Normal skin,"The glow tonic got quite the hype. I wanted to try the glow tonic but just notice it is an exfoliant so not suitable for my dry skin. Previously i used mamonde rose toner, so give this range a shot!"
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,hydrating toner,this works well after u have cleanse your face.it does moisturise your skin without leaving any tackiness behind leaving your skin feeling hydrated and supple. i really love it
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,beautiful smell ,"Very soothing on skin. Love the smell of this product it’s very refreshing. I would definitely buy this product again. The best thing about this product is that it is alcohol free. I have been using this product for 8-9 weeks, I can see the difference "
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,refreshing and soothing,"I used this after I finished the Glow Tonic. I'm in love with anything rose. Rosewater has anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce the redness of irritated skin and get rid of acne, this toner did its job well."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,love it,"I used the rose toner first
 time. It leaves the skin very smooth and glowing even after first wash. My skin is very sensitive and it was hard for me to choose something for my skin. It is very good to hydrate the skin. This product has everything which I need for my skin."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,Nourishing ,Love this toner. My third purchase. Very nourishing. Doesn't break me out. Affordable and long lasting. hope  sephora could sell pixi skincare entire line. 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,lovely rose tonic ,"Wish Pixi will have this in the bigger bottle. Lovely smell, no breakout for me after using compared to the glow tonic. There are better pricing rose water/toner options other than this brand. "
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,A staple product for your skin routine ,This has become my daily toner. I have had less skin problems since using it. It’s a better product for dry or dehydrated skin than oily skin. It’s hydrating and a good daily product to use. 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,Hydrating and Non-Irritating,This toner will hydrate your skin and it is non-irritating so this is good for sensitive skin. The size for the price seems a bit expensive though. I think I can have a bigger toner for the same exact price.
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,great,"This is a great toner, nice abs gentle on my sensitive skin, helps calm my redness and doesn’t dry my skin out, will definitely purchase the full size when I finish this"
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,Smells lovely,"Didn't notice a huge difference skin wise after using it daily for a few months but a lovely smelling and gentle toner! Does a good job of getting any extra dirt of my skin after cleansing, and doesn't dry me out."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,does what it claims,nice rose fragrance and skin feels moist and comfortable after using it.   will definitely consider to repurchase again as the price point is friendly.
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,Mrs,Already in love with this stuff. It's super soothing and smells incredible. Glad I bought the big bottle and can already tell I will be making this a staple in my skin care routine 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,yes!!,"This toner Smells so good, and works amazing. Since introducing into my regime my skin is glowing. Will be buying the big version in my next order for sure!
"
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,so-so,"It does nothing to my skin, I dont see any positive effects to my skin using this toner, but the smell is fine for me, I have combination skin and got few redness and scar but it doesnt help to fade it. Not buying this toner again. "
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,Smells beautiful!,"It smells like roses 🥰 which isn’t the point. I find it very soothing, and think it does help my skin look and feel better. I have dry skin that gets inflamed, and red very easily."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,Good,"Long time user of Glow Tonic. When I saw that the rose tonic has launched, I got it immediately. It's refreshing and smells good. Don't exactly feel any difference from glow tonic though."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,did nothing ,"I’ve heard nice things about pixi toners and how they works, but sadly, their toners did nothing for me at all....................................... >:"
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,good,This toner leaves my skin so soft & clean. Since i have a very sensitive skin this toner helps to sooth and my pores not invisible. Will repurchase this in near future.
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,nice. ,love the smell. If you don't like roses however it may not be for you. it's heavily scented but I like that. works like a soothing toner would. I like the fact it is a hydrating toner as well. 
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,Awesome!!,"Having tried both the pixi glow tonic and this, i feel that both perform equally well. The difference is that this has the rose scent, which i love!!! The lovely rose scent gives it almost like a calming, luxurious feel :)"
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,I’m in love,"All that i can say that’s I’m in love ........
This tonic help me to reduce my blackheads , to reduce the stupid acne !!! 
It help me to make my skin glowiiiing !...
That’s my new superhero !!"
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,love it,Love the product. it smells so good and can feel the difference it makes. It helps cleans my face everyday during my routine. It also feels pure and fresh. Will definately keep buying..
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,loving it,i usually dont trust everything that has rose in it as it makes my skin become dry but this one is expection. the rose scent is not too strong for me. i dont use cotton pad when applying this toner. been using for around 3 weeks. doesnt break my skin. im loving it.
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,Okay product,"This toner is not bad but is not as amazing as the glow tonic. After finishing up my glow tonic, i thought I would give this a try. Will purchase the glow tonic the next time."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,Noice,"I really like this. my skin type when I first bought it was combination and it worked great! then it became dry due to meds, and it still worked, I just don't like how it makes my skin feel when it's really dry. I gave what was left to my sister (early teens) and she loves this. It's great at keeping her pimples under control and really leaves her skin looking amazing. I would recommend, but if you have super dry skin you may not like how it feels. it still works as it says tho."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,Unsuitable,Product is unsuitable for someone like me with sensitive skin. Realize that just using it three times causes the skin to develop some weird red bumps. Stopped using it immediately and the bumps went away after a few days.
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,best every day toner,"The pixi rose tonic smells divine.
This is a great toner for someone new to toners and just starting out in their skincare journey. It's gentle yet effective. You can almsot feel it shrinking your pores. It has a light, fresh rose scent which isn't too over powering like some rose scented things are. It's a great product overall and I will repurchase.."
PIXI-Rose Tonic,,I get a little reaction,I love the smell of this toner and it really has a cute packaging. It is easily absorbed by my skin. The only thing that I don't like about this is that I get little reactions from using it. That's why I use this like twice a week only. Maybe my skin is not suitable for products with floral stuff in it. 
SUNDAY RILEY-Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Singapore,Good pick me up,"Nice smell, not too over empowering. spray is a nice fine mist that gives skin a very nice pick-me-up. It is a tad pricy though. Would probably buy it again if on promotion."
SUNDAY RILEY-Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Canada,SUNDAY RILEY Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Nothing special. Pretty gentle and does increase absorption of products but no major effect.
SUNDAY RILEY-Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Singapore,I think.. it stings my skin,"Got this on sale. It feels nice and the bottle feels great, however not sure if it’s a coincidence but it does sting my skin (I used about 5 sprays each time). Maybe skip if you have dry skin or use any exfoliants. "
SUNDAY RILEY-Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Singapore,mdm,Very light refreshing. Makes skin feel abit firmer after application. And I also love the Color and the whole design of the bottle not to mention. Easy to bring around: feels slightly moisturising but light enough for humid days. You’ll only need a v light moisturizer after if you have oily or combi skin  
SUNDAY RILEY-Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Canada,Underwhelming Pink Water,"I wanted to try this product for a long time, so when I finally purchased it a few months ago, I couldn't wait to incorporate it into my routine.  I was underwhelmed, to be honest.  I noticed no benefit or change in my skin, despite its cost and overall brand reputation.  I will not purchase again and don't recommend it only because, at least in my experience (I used the entire bottle before reviewing here) using it was inconsequential to my skin. For the price, I expect some benefit, however I might as well have been spritzing pink water on my face.  It's too bad because I really wanted to like this.  If I were to point out a silver lining, it would be that it did not upset my extremely sensitive and reactive skin.  That's always a bonus."
SUNDAY RILEY-Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Malaysia,Magical Pink Drink,"WOW! I wished I tried this earlier. What a fantastic product. I’ve never been a fan of Sunday Riley. None of the samples I got really impressed me much. And I just recently found about about the whole fake review scandal which made me even more doubtful of the brand…

BUT

After taking so long in deciding to buy this, my only regret is on not buying it sooner. It sounds unbelievable but my skin became soft upon first use. I thought I imagine it but… nope, been using for a few days now, it is soft and supple every time. I don’t understand how the results are so obvious though. Is it very strong? I had no bad reaction at all. Someone here said it smelled of kombucha, I agree but not offensive at all. Pass very fast. But I am not spraying it on. I spray on hands then dab it on. Works well. 

LOVE THIS! 
"
SUNDAY RILEY-Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Canada,your skin will *drink* this up!,"Another great product from Sunday Riley! The Pink Drink is a great essence also super quick and easy to use. I just mist a few sprays onto my face and neck, pat into the skin then let dry for a minute and continue with my other skincare products. I do use this after cleansing and toner as a third step in my skincare routine. It feels very hydrating to the skin and so luxurious. This is definitely not just another face mist! It has a purpose, so if you use it correctly you will get results! :)"
SUNDAY RILEY-Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Taiwan,Miss,"Overall is very good product, i read from someone else’s review saying “if you just want to pamper yourself then get it” so I got it and she was right!

It does nothing more than a normal hydrate mist would do and it’s much more expensive.

I won’t buy it again and I don’t really recommend anyone to buy it but if you are a Sunday Riley fan then go for it girl!"
SUNDAY RILEY-Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Canada,SUNDAY RILEY Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,I have no idea what this product does - I’ve included it as part of my nightly routine but don’t notice any difference from using it.
SUNDAY RILEY-Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Singapore,Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,I love this essence so much coz it leaves my skin soft and hydrated. No sticky feeling n adsorb almost immediately leaving a healthy glow!!! Will definitely repurchase. 
SUNDAY RILEY-Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Canada,Nope!,"Not a useful product. It didn't pair with any of serums, treatments. When combined with other products it irritate my skin. I couldn't see any discernable difference that the product made when used alone."
SUNDAY RILEY-Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Malaysia,Pink Drink,Not sure if it's moisturizing enough. Smells kinda like kombucha. But PRICEY!
SUNDAY RILEY-Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Canada,Champagne for the face ... but no results,"I got on the Good Genes train and am wow'd by that product, so I thought I would add this to my skincare routine as well. I'm down to half a bottle of Pink Drink. I use it at night after cleansing but but before putting on Good Genes and my moisturizer. When you spray it on, it smells like champagne and I can see how they've added that fragrance for the luxury and ritual of it ... but if I'm being honest, I'm not sure what else this did. There were no noticeable results from it that I couldn't credit to my other products. It's also quite pricey. For those reasons, I see no reason to purchase again or recommend."
SUNDAY RILEY-Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Singapore,Balancing ,"I use this as a hydrating toner prior to moisturiser. I have dry, sometimes sensitive skin and experienced no breakouts or irritation with this. Instead my skin feels calm and soothed.

As with Caudalie’s elixir, this is more a pamper product than necessity. Solid nonetheless."
SUNDAY RILEY-Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Canada,I don't get it.,I'm about half way through my bottle and I'm still not entirely sure what it's doing. I do notice my skin is more dehydration and raw feeling. Will definitely not be repurchasing this.
SUNDAY RILEY-Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Canada,SUNDAY RILEY Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,I really like using this. Because of the fermentation of ingredients this has a light ‘beer’ like scent but is refreshing and nice to use. I’m sensitive to scents but would repurchase.
SUNDAY RILEY-Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,Canada,SUNDAY RILEY Pink Drink Firming Resurfacing Essence,"Love it! It’s an amazing addition to my skincare routine, great for my dehydrated, combination,  sensitive skin. Gets rid of redness and dehydration almost instantly and really seems to allow my serums and moisturizer to absorb even more seamlessly! Just a beautiful product and a great price point compared to similar essences that way cost more yet don’t give as great of a result. As someone who’s worked in the skincare industry for almost 10 years and happens to be a brand representative for another amazing company, it’s hard for me to get this excited about a product. I haven’t even used it for a  complete skin cycle yet(28 days if your lucky) and I can already see a difference! I’m excited to see the results when 28 days is up and after more cycles have passed.
 Also the spryer on this product is great, the mist is fine and distributed very evenly, which is fantastic since some products with a sprayer are good but the spray nozzle can ruins it. Thought I should mention that since I know for some people like myself it can be an annoyance and ruin experience of the product."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,Hard Pass,This is another toner that I really wanted to like but it just did nothing. Didn’t help clear up dark spots or anything. So basically it stung for no good reason. Save your money and stick to what works for you skin.
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,Boscia Resurfacing Treatment Toner,"It BURNS! It worked well the first 2 days or so and some break outs even immediately went away but then it started burning ssoooo bad everytime I applied it, with my face turning all red for about 10 minutes every time I applied it, I had to immediately sooth my skin right after with a strong moisturizer or night cream. Around my eyes was the worst, felt like I had the worst sunburn ever. I don't normally have a super sensitive skin so I was really taken aback by this product. Never used it for more than 5-7 days straight because the burning sensation just gets worse everyday."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,Not for Everyone,So I used this for about 3 weeks but my skin was still tingling and burning during application. This was too harsh for my sensitive skin but this worked great for my boyfriend. He was in need of some heavier exfoliation than me and treatment for acne. As advertised this product has helped him. This isn't for everyone and I hate how the product dries up and flakes around the lid but this does work for some.
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,"A must for helping dry, patchy spots and acne!","Can’t live without this product! I spread it over my face and neck with my reusable cotton pads. Helps so much with acne, taking away patchy, dry skin. Overall, way less skin problems! And I have tricky skin that acts up. I can see my skin go downhill if I run out"
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,love!,"I rarely write reviews but I really felt I needed to boast about this product. 
I suffer from mild adult acne (why do we need to call it “adult”) and this has cleared it up immensely. I use it daily after washing in the evening before moisturizer. 
I have heard that just a regular toner works too but I’ve been using a lot of acv base products (dphue hair products) since it has such great benefits and am finding great results. Will continue to use this product as it has help curb the zits."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,the RESULTS came in FAST,"First off, it STUNG some areas and tingled around EVERYWHERE for the first few times so I used a soothing toner and moisturizer afterwards. After maybe 2-3 uses though (not kidding), my breakouts had flattened and the other upcoming ones were just gone. My scars had faded so much and my blackheads were incredibly reduced. I’ve used powerful toners before, mainly korean and paula’s choice but this one really gave me the results the fastest; i guess beauty really hurts/stings sometimes lol. After about a week my skin got used to it and I’ve been using this mainly at night and my skin is LOVING it. This is my perfect toner with the bha (SA), aha (glycolic), and vitamin c - all ingredients that my skin loves so I knew it would work out but i really didn’t expect it to work this well. And no there is no smell."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,Cleared & Softened Skin!,"This is one of those products that transformed my skin in a matter of a week which is rare for me considering I have super stubborn skin. I use this once a day and it stopped my reoccurring breakouts, helped face acne scars, brightened my complexion, and softened my skin. Also, I was afraid this product would have a stinky ACV smell, but it doesn't."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,BEST TONER FOR CLEAN and CLEAR SKIN,Omg within one week of using this toner my acne stopped returning and I have less white and blackheads. It also doesn’t burn and I love it because there’s no ACV smell. I have super sensitive skin and I was scared it would make my skin red but it hasn’t flared me at all. I also finish all uses with serum and cerave moisturizer.
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,Use it every night!,Love the fact that this has both glycolic acid and salicylic acid!  I use this every night.  Definitely smells like apple cider vinegar which doesn't bother me at all as it fades immediately once it's on the skin.
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Australia,Helps with hormonal congestion ,"Bought this to see if it can help with hormonal congestion along my jawline. It did help with daily use. I don’t apply on my whole face, only on affected areas ie. jawline and forehead as it’s quite a high percentage of acids. "
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,Pleasantly surprised,"Been into finding a good BHA/AHA toner and discovered this Boscia one. I was initially using the Ready Steady Glow one from REN and really like that one but wanted to try out another brand. Only used the Boscia one a few times but I like that it's scent free or lightly scented and for those wondering, it doesn't smell like Apple cider vinegar. On my oily skin, it doesn't sting or burn, I especially like the finish of it on my skin. With REN, it leaves a sticky feeling but Boscia leaves my skin clean and not sticky. If you want a REN comparable or just a good acid toner, Boscia is better for your wallet, works well and the ingredients in it are wonderful."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Australia,Drying and harsh,"Left my skin dry and almost flaky, did not do anything to tone my skin as compared to before using it. VERY painful around areas of more delicate skin so definitely avoid near the lips because it has made mine raw"
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Malaysia,Pores visibly smaller,"I have been using this for two weeks. And noticed pores are getting smaller. On the first few day of starting this product , it stings but  after a few days it’s okay. The best way to apply this product is to tap on the face so the serum is easily absorbed into, not rubbing it with a cotton. Can give a try if you are looking for a new toner. "
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Australia,Average ,"This toner is alright, nothing special. I was slightly disappointed as I thought it would be exceptional due to the write up on Sephora. The smell is really unpleasant, strong smell and taste (if you get it on your lips) of apple cider vinegar. Like you don’t really want to get near anyone for a while after you use it. I’ve purchased 2 Boscia products recently and realized maybe it’s not my brand......"
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,strong and effective,Amazing for oily acne prone skin. I use this every other night
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,A bit temperamental,This toner can be a bit harsh. I’ve used in on my persistently acne prone skin mostly as a treatment (2-3 times a week) and it does help resurface difficult acne however almost always burns my skin. I generally avoid open acne but sometimes can’t avoid the stinging. I would consider purchasing again just not when dealing with a lot of active acne.
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,great toner to fight acne,"Must have toner. My skin visibly looks cleaner and acne virtually disappears. It’s insane. I haven’t been able to find something that works this good in a long time. I use it with clear complexion cleansing gel, and then moisturize with their clear complexion moisturizer and my skin has never looked better !"
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Australia,alright ,"This stuff burns, it does make your skin soft in the morning and makes it look smooth but before buying this do be aware that it does burn and will make your skin tingle "
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,Amazing results!,"I have extremely sensitive, acne-prone skin and after using this product every night for 2 months, in conjunction with a serum from Caudalie, has completely cleared up my skin! I haven't had a break out, or even a single pimple, in over a month. Absolutely magical product."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,Works great,"Evened out skin tone, reduced acne scar appearance, cleared pores. I use twice a day, I don’t have sensitive skin. I find it burns/tingles a little bit hasn’t caused me any problems in the month I’ve been using."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,Boscia Resurfacing Treatment Toner,"i have suuuuuper sensitive acne prone skin. for me personally this worked WONDERSSSS! my skin has never been so smooth and my breakouts have went way down, i love this stuff and would recommend it! remember though everyone’s skin is different :)"
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,in love,"my new favourite toner, my skin is so much clearer now and I am pretty sure this treatment played a big role into it! I've just re purchase it and I am now curious to try out more of Boscia!"
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,Changed my skin!!,"This product has changed my skin. I personally find it gentle enough to use daily, but I only use it at night and followed by a hydrating serum+moisturizer routine. You can literally feel your brand new skin 5 min after using it - it sweeps away all dead skin and flakes and dries up any active blemishes or large pores. Can not recommend enough!!"
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,LOVE,Will repurchase again and again! I have dry to normal sensitive skin and this does not irritate me at all. Cleans pores over time and leaves skin smooth. I use only at night before oils and moisturizer.  Other reviewers saying it burns seem to be using it on broken skin which is a huge no no for any acid. It also works like a charm on developing breakouts.
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Boscia Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Like it so far! A-little too early to see changes but I have heard from several people I know that it works wonders and I saw the difference in their skin. I will say that holy COWWW this ish STINGS! Every time I apply it I have to look myself in the mirror and myself it will be alright. Then after about 1 minute I am okay LOL. I assume the stinging will go away once my skin gets used to it...
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Boscia Resurfacing Treatment Toner,"I have mixed feelings about this one. I like how my skin looks after using this product so far, pretty smooth and glowy but this stuff burns like crazy on the spots where the occasional zit pops up. I’m really debating on whether I like this product enough to purchase again and deal with it or just find another toner that doesn’t feel like I’m cauterizing my zits"
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Boscia Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Is amazing. My skin is clean better then ever. I use in the morning and night with no problems. Love Boscia.
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,really great for moderate acne,"This toner is great for black heads and moderate acne. Anything more than that and I think it would be too harsh. Any open pore on your skin (like an open wound or freshly expressed pimple) and applying this will burn really badly. I avoid it on areas that are that way when applying. Other wise I LOVE this toner. It has worked well to keep my acne non existent like other acne toners have not successfully done. Also it has lightened up the scars on my face from previous blemishes. This stuff is very strong so I only use it at night and use another acne toner in the morning. Will continue to purchase since it keeps my skin clear and I have noticed a significant different in blackheads, small zits, and dark spots on my face."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,struggling with acne ? pass,"if you have acne i strongly advise you to avoid this product,  it doesnt do much to acne beside burning and flaking off the skin. its too strong even if i dont have sensitive skin."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Boscia Resurfacing Treatment Toner,"Seriously one of the best toners ever. I have dry skin but still concerned with pores and texture and I swear I see a difference after a week. I do use a ferulic acid serum during the day and retinol at night so there was sensitivity at first, so I started out using it every other day. Now I use it everyday and I am in love with my skin!"
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Boscia Resurfacing Treatment Toner,"really good toner, it made my skin very smooth and glowy, without making it oily"
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Boscia Resurfacing Treatment Toner,This product helps get rid of my acne and makes my face feel baby soft the next morning!
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,SMOOTH BABYYY,"I think people forget that this is a treatment toner. This isn’t meant for your everyday use. The exfoliation is 30%! The strongest I’ve yet to see on the market; so if you think something that strong can be used everyday you’re crazy lol. This should be used maybe 2-3 times a week depending how much you can take. I don’t think people with highly sensitive skin can handle this. Perhaps only mild hydrating toners. Now that’s out of the way, I love this product! Chemical exfoliation changed my life! My skin is the smoothest it’s ever been and I will never go back to scrubs. This product will treat texture and dead skin, leaving you with nice smooth supple skin. Just remember to not abuse it; this is a treatment toner not a daily one. I suggest once a week and upping it and testing what you can handle. It’s very potent which is why I only use it 2-3 times a week."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,Boscia Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Not the best toner I’ve ever used but definitely a good one. Helps to make skin smoother and softer but has not done a whole lot for my pigmentation from acne scarring.
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Boscia Resurfacing Treatment Toner,It really dries out my skin even if I use the tiniest amount.  I probably won't buy it again.
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Boscia Resurfacing Treatment Toner,"This is a potent toner that will make your skin tingle especially if you have sensitive skin like me. However, it is gentle enough to use every night. Whenever I use this product, I wake up with the most radiant, smooth looking skin. Love this toner so much!"
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Yes yes and more yes,"OBSESSED. My skin is so much more clear, even, brighter and tighter! It is very potent. Not for skin care newbies, and not for someone who's skin isn't used to being treated with acids. It will burn on open skin! This is 100% a new staple in my routine."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,Stung My Skin,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This was recommended to me by a Sephora employee, suggesting that maybe using a chemically exfoliating toner would combine two-in-one steps of my skincare routine. 

That sounded like a good idea, so I asked for a sample. It stung my skin when I put it on and made a few spots on my face redder than before. 

Will be looking for something else."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,New favorite toner,"This has helped clear up so much of my adult acne that appears around my jaw and chin. I have very sensitive skin and mostly only use it use it once a day or every other day. It is very potent and strong.  Apple cider vinegar based but no smell at all from it and I’m not allergic to it! 

Compared to the tea tree oil stuff that other toners used which I’m allergic to and don’t like the mint feeling they give, this toner has no smell as far as I can tell and only gives you a slight tingle, make sure you moisturize after!!"
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,BUY THIS,This is the best toner I have ever used. It has COMPLETELY cured my acne. It has also softened my skin lightened my dark spots and refined my pores.
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,"super exfoliating, no sting!!!!","I was nervous to get this because of the stinging some people experienced, but I love ACV and wanted to try! FRICKIN LOVE THIS STUFF. Honestly the perfect toner for me. It says on the bottle it's for combo to oily skin, but mine's normal/dry and they get along real well."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Boscia Resurfacing Treatment Toner,"I recently bought this toner, and I think it's very good (just like pretty much everything from Boscia). I noticed a slight tingle feeling when using it on my face, but nothing bothersome. I have oily skin, and this is helping me with keeping my face clean and shrinking my pores."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,sensitive skin beware,"Tried this on in stores while browsing for a good 20 mins after application. It felt so clean and smooth with initial swipe. However, within 20mins I felt a burning sensation and had to wipe it off with a mild toner. I have tried many AHA products and this is not gentle enough for sensitive skin. Should really test it out in store before buying! Sadly it just didn’t work for me!"
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,Canada,Boscia Resurfacing Treatment Toner,"Really helps with skin texture. My skin looks brighter after 1 week. Does not burn too much, but slight tingle. Still looking for it to clear pores,  but it’s definitely helped with some blackheads."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,So Sad This Didn’t Work Out.,Irritated my skin. Skin felt sticky and tacky after each use. Would not recommend for daily use. I don’t even consider myself to have sensitive skin but this was too harsh.
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,SO HAPPY I BOUGHT THIS,"I came across this while searching for a new toner. There wasn’t many reviews but I loved the ingredients, so I bought it. I fell in love. This toner doesn’t have an overwhelming smell. It does what it says. With the BHA/AHA (ladies these are awesome) it makes my skin look so clear. It cleans out my pores which is awesome because they are very large and congested. I will forever repurchase this!"
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Boscia Resurfacing Treatment Toner,My skin feels painful every time after I apply this product.
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,you need!,Absolutely love! It makes my skin so much softer and plumped too!
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Just Okay,Would have given it more of a 3.5 star rating. Honestly I don’t think this product does much for me. When I first bought it I used it more often to see how it affected my skin and didn’t really see much of a difference. It sometimes can be too harsh especially after using a mask and burn a little. I don’t think this is a product that should be used every single day. The one thing I really like about it and the reason I will continue to use it is that it removes excess makeup that my cleanser did not take off. I limit the number of times I wear makeup to twice a week since it really makes a difference with the skin and I use this to finish off my makeup removing routine.
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Boscia Resurfacing Treatment Toner,"After using for a couple of days, I have tiny red bumps all over my face. My skin is worse than it has been in years. Do not buy if you have sensitive skin, and although it says daily use, I would not recommend that. It seems too harsh for daily use."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Burn Baby Burn,"Most toners leave my face feeling fresh and clean, this one did not. My face was burning after every use and made my red cheeks even more red... the burning did not go away until I rinsed my face with water. Thanks but no thanks Boscia!"
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Helllooo smooth skin!,"I love this toner! It is potent, so keep in mind if you have sensitive skin like me, I only use this toner 2-3 times a week but I love how it makes my skin tingle, and I wake up with the most radiant, smooth skin! I have combo / oily skin and struggle with breakouts and a little texture but I love this toner for smoothing out my skin and evening my complexion. Boscia did it again! Love all of their skincare."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Boscia Resurfacing Treatment Toner,"This toner is def worth trying. I've only been using it for a few days, and I already saw a difference after the first time I used it. My skin feels so clean and rid of buildup, but not stripped after using it. I have very oily skin and live in a hot"
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,good stuff,"hoping this can replace my tarte knockout, as it's cheaper for the same amount of product. so far, so good. If you are used to acid peels or chemical exfoliants, this should be fine. Tingles for sure but doesnt burn and isnt uncomfortable."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Boscia Resurfacing Treatment Toner,"I have relatively large pores which was caused by my horrible acne as a teenager. Because of this, I can see all the sebum buildup at the end of the day before discovering this product. But after using this product, my skin has been so clean as it penetrates in my pores and cleans them! It also minimizes the appearance of my huge pores. My skin is radiant and smooth. I use this along with the Clear Complexion Cleanser and no longer have acne. Another good product by Boscia."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,If you like blistered skin this is for you...,"Would not recommend for sensitive skin. It made my face, especially my forehead, breakout it little blister type bumps and left my skin looking and feeling raw."
BOSCIA-Resurfacing Treatment Toner,USA,Worked better than I thought!,"After reading the description of the product, I decided to try it out. I'm so glad I did! Even with the first use I saw a difference. I don't have wrinkles, so I can't say how well it works in that area, but everything else it said it would do, it did. I definitely recommend!"
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Malaysia,Witch Hazel Lavender Toner,"This is my first time bought this toner, I felt that is strong alcohol smells when I opened it, and that was sensitive on my skin when I applied it,just a normal toner, not suitable for sensitive skin and everyday use ."
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Malaysia,love it ,I enjoyed this product very much. The toner texture and fragrance is natural and easy on skin when I apply it’s really feeling refreshing. Almost like cucumber which I like. Simply love it. 
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Singapore,simple toner,Affordable toner to get if u just want something v simple! Doesn’t really exfoliate much but price is really worth the amount of toner in the bottle. Also don’t need to apply so much. 
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Singapore,Mario badescu ,Mario badescu witch hazel and lavender  toner fulfills it's basic function as a toner . It feels gentle on my skin and i  did not have any adverse reaction . value for money
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,USA,Mario Badescu Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Smells good and goes on easy but made my face feel a bit dry and stripped
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Singapore,my first purchased,so far so good. results nothing much after applied.  smell consider nice! will try rose toner after finishing this toner. price is consider reasonable.  will restock and purchase again.  
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Singapore,Soothing Toner,"It’s a very soothing product and helps calm my skin down especially since I have very sensitive skin. The smell of lavender is a nice touch as well. I’m not sure if it does work for me but my skin does not flare up unlike certain products so I would say it does the job. 
"
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Malaysia,Executive Admin,Kept face moisture; non-sticky feeling; cleaned well as cotton pad have residue after use the toner. Love the Lavender smell and relaxation feels. Will buy again.
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Malaysia,alright,"This is just alright, I feel it doesn't do much as it says to my skin at the same time it doesn't harm my skin so, it is a big bottle and worth the money, if I don't find any other toner I would just repurchase this just to replace a toner. "
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,USA,Mario Badescu Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,I use this after exfoliating and it leaves my skin feeling smoothing and clear.
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Malaysia, An average toner!,This is just an average toner for me. Good thing there was no side effects or reaction to my combination skin.  It's got a pleasant fragrance. Not to strong. 
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Singapore,Singapore ,Works fine for my dehydrated and acne prone skin. Doesn’t dry out my skin or gives me breakouts. Probably one of the more value for money toners for Mario badescu. 
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Singapore,works great!,Works great as expected. I like the minimalist packaging which is easy to recycle. Doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin although I admit to not using it as religiously as I should. 
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Singapore,Toner review,"Very soothing to my acne prone skin. Helps to smooth, soften and calm the skin after wash. Also helped to bring down my acne. I usw it regularly! Going to add it to my regular skincare routine"
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,USA,I love the smell,"I haven't noticed a change in my skin, but I still love using this toner. It is not harsh on my face and smells divine. Slight tingle without the burn. Great price, too."
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,USA,Great For Dull Looking Skin!,I started using this on a Fri night and by Sun morning I already see a difference on my complexion. My face glows with radiance and it no longer looks dull/lifeless. Plus the acne is clearing up and even taking care of these stubborn blackheads I deal with. I should have taken a BEFORE picture because I cannot praise this toner enough! I definitely will be purchasing this toner again! ❤
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Singapore,its alright,first time using this brand and using it on a daily basis day and night. i dont see any difference on my face for the past months that i have used it. im not sure if it does helps my skin. i do get a tingling feeling a few seconds after applying it on my face. the price for the bottle is definitely great. overall its okay i guess.
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Malaysia,flawless,I bought this for me because before this i try in mini size. my brother wanna try also. End up he likes the toner. He already use half bottle and the result was really good. His skin become much better now and he was really happy 😘
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,USA,Just ok,This was an alright toner. I was not impressed enough to buy it again. I also don’t understand why it needs coloring in it.
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Singapore,Review ,"Brought it because the overall good review and it’s really affordable for this size(236ml). Doesn’t help with anything beside hydrating which many other toner does the same. I have normal-oily skin, but using this toner sting my skin and it felt weird afterwards. Don’t want to jinx anything but this is the first time my skin actually felt bad after using a toner. Will not purchase again."
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Singapore,Acne-Prone/ Sensitive Skin,"It did not help my hormonal acne even though it did dry out my acnes. However, it did not help with calming my outbreaks. Therefore, I did not reach out to it as much as the other Toners I owned. "
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,USA,ONE OF NY FAVES!!,I am so glad this is now at sephora! great toner at an affordable price. beats some of the more expensive ones that I own!!
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Malaysia,miss,"tingling feeling using this, maybe because my skin is a bit sensitive, it does clean up my skin very well. I'm not gonna buy it again as it is not suitable with my skin."

MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Philippines,worth it,"It's mild and it does not sting. Tamed my sister's breakouts. My sister and I use this every night, I am surprised we still haven't ran out of this product yet. You get the amount of product you pay for, so I think it's worth it. "
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Malaysia,Review,"Love the value for so much! Got it on white member 15% off. It leaves a 2 minutes burning sensation on my face when I apply it, but afterwards it's nothing and it leaves your skin glowy "
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Malaysia,Great ,"I love the lavender smell. Suitable for my skin. Once applied, it was so fresh in natural way. Will repeat order soon. Not expensive & worth it. Recommended "
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Singapore,Broke me out ,"I got this because it was affordable and seemed good. Sadly, it didn't work for me at all. It smells great, but when I apply it it feels slightly stinging and it broke me out after a week's use. I have dry-combination skin that is not particularly sensitive (don't want to jinx it but I hardly react badly).  "
MARIO BADESCU-Witch Hazel and Lavender Toner,Malaysia,Nothing special,"After using it for a while, it doesn't feel like it does anything for my skin. Apart from that, the harmful ingredients used are slightly concerning. I doubt I would buy this again. "

PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,Singapore,nutrition for the face,Love how you can spray on some vitamins on the face at any time of the day. Bottle is tiny enough to fit in a purse. Smells lovely and it’s super refreshing. My sensitive skin approves. 
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,Australia,Refreshing face mist,This smells sooo good! It's nice and fresh with a great citrus smell. It doesn't irrtate my skin and gives it this extra little glow after spraying. I use it in the morning as well as throughout the day. i haven't yet tried it over make up but it's so light I think it would be fine. 
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,Singapore,highly recommended..,"I did not try it yet, bcus I bought it first time after reading all the reviews . It’s a highly recommended makeup setting spray so I hope that it will be good for me too.. "
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,Singapore,Finally found my favourite face mist!,"I have tried so many different face mists from different brands and i love how this smells on my face! So refreshing and citrusy! It brings moisture to my face without any stinging sensation on my face, or being too wet over my face or makeup-ed face. I am going to stick with this forever! If there is a travel size, would be happy to let it sit in my handbag so I can bring it everywhere!"
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,Malaysia,good product ,"Love all the Pixi mist that I have bought. This is 
good as a setting spray, hydrating ur skin and also a good spray before applying makeup or on just bare face. I have also tried using over my hair and it does not leave a dry frizzy finish."
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,Australia,Gorgeous Mist,Fantastic mist and I love it! Goes great with my other Pixi products and will definitely repurchase when it runs out..................................
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,Philippines,wake up mist,what i love about this product is the power it give my skin to be at glow even if i lack sleep. This is really something for grabs most specially for people lile me who stayed up late due to working hours condition.
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,Singapore,simple spray,Pixi's mists never disappoint me. Useful for just a light spray to refresh in the morning.                                                                 
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,Singapore,Pixi vitamin mist,Love this vitamin mist...Perfect for my dry and sensitive skin. It will give matte effect after spray...this mist make my make up stays long too....the price is reasonable.
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,Singapore,one of my faves,Repurchased! Love the scent and how it makes my skin feel refreshed. The only thing is that it’s sometimes a hit or miss with these pixi spray bottles. 
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,Singapore,refreshing ,It’s my first time purchasing this product and just tried recently. It is light and has a citrusy smell which makes the mist refreshing. However I’m not too sure about the benefits it brings cos I don’t see any visible difference hence I didn’t give it a 5star.
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,Singapore,so far so good,Been only using it for 1 day but so far so good. Its really refreshing and has a tint of scent(not very strong) but a light citrus scent which i love! Bought the small one might consider getting the big one 
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,great for morning,"Use this every morning to wake up after washing my face. Helps hydrate after a long night’s sleep in air con haha. Already purchased 3 and will be buying more in the future!
"
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,Fresh,Pixi is my favourite brand. This mist is really light and smells good. Not too sure what or how it actually helps my skin but it’s like spraying scented water if I’m honest. 
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,Wakes your skin up,"The citrusy smell is lovely and not overpowering. The mist bottle could have sprayed a finer mist. In terms of benefits, i don't really see it doing anything to my skin, but a good perk-me-up midday. "
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,Love the citrusy scent! Perfect as a setting spray! ,"I love the lemony-citrusy scent for this item, but yet it is not too overpowering! I mainly use this a makeup setting spray in the morning. Sets and melts all my powder makeup together. The smell is very refreshing as I get ready to start my day. My only complaint is, please remember to shut your eyes TIGHT when you are spraying this on your face. It stings my eye quite a bit once when I just blindly sprayed it on my face without closing my eyes. But other than that, love the product! "
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,Fine Mist with a scent of citrus,"The spray is quite fine, it is nowhere as fine as the other mist i love, which is from Caudalie. It is refreshing to the skin and seems to have a tingling feel on the skin.  It has a scent of with a hint of citrus, which is uplifting. "
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,Vitamin Wakeup Mist,"I bought it for the hype this product receives. Fine mist, almost feel like I am not spraying anything. It is an okay product. Not something I would repurchase though."
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,Nice smell but,"I've purchased this after I was exposed to their Milky Hydrating version. The smell is nice - citrus-like. But needs to be careful when spraying near the eye and the mist/droplet that accidentally got into your eye will sting you. Other than the smell is nice, I don't find any benefits of this mist other than just water. "
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,refreshing,This mist works for my skin! I haven’t have any negative reaction to it. It feel refreshing and I use it when I layer my skincare morning and night! :) would repurchase again! 
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,Iove this,I use this every morning and usually when I don’t wanna wear makeup! It keeps my face dewy and glowy the whole day without looking oily. Love this! Just two sprays is enough for me! Would recommend for a lazy morning moisture session! 
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,good product,I love to try anything from pixi. I believe in their products cause it is really suitable with my skin and do wonder. I have rose mist and love it too! :)
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,refreshing ,It literally wakes me up everytime! I use it almost every day to make me wake up! Lols! My skin feels refreshed! Pixi makes the best skincare products!
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,Strong scrnt,This has a strong scent and a lot of essential oils which are not good for sensitive skin. I didn’t notice that it was especially moisturizing or refreshing either.
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,Love!,Love how this smells and it gives such a nice glow! chose this because it has such a similar formulation to my tatcha mist which is almost $70! The ingredients are great and I love how it does not have olive oil in it like the other pixi mists!
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,It’s Okay,"I think this is great if you’re looking for a simple refreshing face mist. But, it doesn’t really help energize the face. The smell’s nice (light orange-citrusy scent) so no need to worry about excessive amounts of perfume "
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,Good quality product!,It was just nice to have this! Totally super love! Felt super refreshed all day long! Can you used as toner  as well. Easy handling plus suitable for travel size! 
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,Amazing!,I use it as soon as I wake up for a burst of hydration. It's so refreshing and leaves skin feeling awake! I sometimes use it over makeup too to give me a glowy look but I prefer to use this product barefaced. This smell is amazing too. So natural and fresh. Will definitely be repurchasing!
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,Normal Face Mist,"Bought this during the 20% sale to try out as I’m recently into Pixi. Heard good things about their products and decided to put this in my basket. I don’t see any huge difference it has done to my face so far after using it. Face felt hydrated when using it along with the nice citrusy smell but it made my face looks a little oily/shiny though. One bad point is that whenever I use this, the droplets always gets into my eyes and it stings the crap out of me.. Definitely not going to repurchase it."
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,quick fix,"love this perk me up facial spray to give me a fresh and radiance look. so I dont look like i just woke up. lol... 
love the fresh tangy smell too. it does help waking me and put a healthy glow on me. "
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,"Good formula, poor packaging","The formula of the spray itself is great, and i got it primarily because it contains niacinamide, but the nozzle that dispenses the spray is terrible. The formula squirts out in these really aggressive spurts, unlike the spray of, say, an UD all-nighter or mac fix+."
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,Vitamin Wakeup Mist,I use it before I applied makeup. Doesn’t feel anything. I not sure what benefits it give me but gotta give a credit for the fragrance/smell.   This gives off a citrusy smell. Didn’t feels any different using this.
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,disappointing purchase,"smell: funky citrus, texture: sticky and oily, packaging: nozzle causes the contents to spray out in spurts rather than mists which drenches parts of my face and leaves other areas completely untouched; basically, does not wake me up at all "
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,refreshing ,"Been using for a week now, I would say it's not doing anything visible to my skin but would like to think that is infusing vitamins to my skin. It's refreshing and I use it every morning and night. It's an ok product for me. "
PIXI-Vitamin Wakeup Mist,,vitamin scents,i like the idea of the spray mist but not really impressed by the mist came out from it.. the vitamin c scent not that pleasant for me.. it really smells like spraying vitamin c onto your face.. it does nothing if compared to glow tonic that did wonders to me..
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,If it weren’t for the nozzle…,I love it overall but the misting nozzle gets clogged or breaks pretty quickly so have ended up patting it into face as a toner (which is nice but defeats the purpose of buying a mist). Never had this issue w their rose mist bottles so not sure what changed. The aloe in it seemed really gentle and effective in helping along the healing of a sunburn and it’s refreshing. No acne and good for sensitive skin when it actually comes out
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,Singapore,LOVE IT! ,"Really love this! SO MUCH BETTER than the lavender spray. I was in desperate need of face mist/spray coz face felt very dry after makeup + mask. The spray is very fine so doesnt feel like my whole face is splashed with water but still covers and moist the whole face. Smells good and doesnt sting eye or nose (like the lavender one) *** 
Bottle is a little heavy to carry around "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,Singapore,Beautiful product,"Although mint is not my fave type of scent, this blend is bearable . I used to use their Lavendar mist but it stings the eyes. This time round , this is way better. If u put a light mist it will not sting. There is a little aqua marine crystal in the bottle,cute. The spray provides an even and light mist. Bottle is made of glass. Product provides good level of hydration. I am in my late thirties and my skin is getting a little drier. This product is just nice for me.I spray it before I apply Kora's mask , great combination. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,Singapore,spritzer to refresh the skin,"Quite like this as a spray to fix the make up, or to use during the day as a refreshner as I feel tiredness. Was worried I might not like the strength of the peppermint scent, but it turns out mild and ok. "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,"The mist shoots out in a direct line… not effective at all as a mist/spray.  Also, the spray part clogs after use and the pump part broke. Had to dump it into a diff bottle.  Not worth the issues for the price of this item."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Phenomenal Product,Pricey but worth it. Sprintz on face between a marathon of video meetings and breathe deep! It’s wonderful!
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,"I received the Minty Mineral Hydration Mist as a gift from Kora Organics. This mist give my skin a beautiful glow, t’s nice and refreshing, so far is working with my dry skin. I really love the idea of adding a rose quartz to the bottle for good energy."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,Australia,love the scent and the mint feeling,"purchase this during winter. The scent smell wonder (natural smell of cucumber mix a hint of minty). it's perfect for refresh make up during the day, but don't expect it can give same hydration like a toner does. the mist is very fine. this product would definitely work well in cooling down skin during hot summer. love the refresh feeling of it, it feels like my pores can finally breath even though it can't really hydrate my skin. And the ingredient is save for my sensitive skin! "
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,LOVE LOVE!!,Absolutely amazing!! You won’t be disappointed! Also it smells absolutely AMAZING!!
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,Singapore,Super fine mist,This is a much better mist in the Kora line! So much hydrating and effective to use than the lavender mist. I love the palo santo scent and the minty feeling every spray of this! 
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Ok product,"I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review. I’m honestly not sure how i feel about this. It’s nice and refreshing, but at the same time, it’s very sticky on the skin. I immediately took it off when it wouldnt dry down"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Sadly no :(,Unfortunately this product has alcohol in it which doesn’t make it clean.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,This is my fav moisturizing mist!,"I was gifted a bottle of Minty Mineral Hydration Mist complimentary from Kora, and it's almost gone already! I was already a huge fan of Kora products, and this one is just as wonderful as anticipated. 
The packaging is lovely, and the bottle has a nice feel in your hand. This lightly mint scented spray is so cool and refreshing, reviving both my makeup AND my spirits in this thick Georgia heat.
I will absolutely be purchasing another bottle of Minty Mist, as well as getting some as gifts. This moisturizing mist is amazing"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Great for summer days!,"Can be used prior to and after moisturizing to best lock in oils and hydration and also throughout the day to refresh, rehydrate, and set your makeup. 
It is super cool, isn’t it? This products is a game changer, indeed!"

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Amazing product,"This is a really nice refreshing mist BEST for summer. It has a minty scent that felt so amazing on the skin on hot days. After the first try I put it in the fridge to make the product cool and felt more refresh when I used it after coming in the house from the sunny outing,  Final thought, it’s refreshing and hydrating and works well for my skin."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Cooling and refreshing!,"This minty mist is super refreshing! It makes my face feel refreshed and cooling on a hot, humid day. My skin isn’t that sensitive, so it did not irritate my skin. I will continue to use this!!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,issa no from me,"cute bottle but it’s a no from me. it has a veryyyyy strong minty scent that i just can’t get past. i’d save minty flavors for gum or altoids, but not for the face. not as refreshing as the bottle looks. the spray nozzle is suuuuper fine, so fine that i could barely feel it spray tbh. would not purchase or recommend"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,"This is a really nice refreshing mist for summer. It has a minty scent/feel which is amazing on hot days and while trapped in a car for a road trip. If you don’t like minty scents, skip this one because it’s pretty strong. At first, the mister created a super fine mist but after a few uses it seemed to get a little clogged and then started spraying in my face in a direct stream. I think if the sprayer wasn’t so temperamental, I would love this because it’s refreshing and hydrating and works well for my skin."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,This is a really nice mist for everyday. I think mint is great & zippy - especially for summertime. It gives a nice natural smell. I haven't really used it as a makeup spray though! I like it for refreshing my skin. The glass bottle is gorgeous but I don't think I'd travel with it.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Aromatherapy and Skincare in a Bottle,"I had high hopes for this (I love a good facial spray, I love mint, and I’ve always wanted to try Kora Organics) and this product did not disappoint!! The bottle is beautiful and glass. The mister is divine. There is a tiny rose quartz crystal in the bottle that gives some ASMR when you shake it (if you’re into that kind of thing). The scent is like aromatherapy in a bottle. Just don’t breathe in right away when you use this! Breathing in mint is a little tricky without tickling your nose quite a bit. At least for me. Highly recommend!!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,"It’s a nice and refreshing mist that is definitely perfect for summer time.  The mister itself is also quite fine.  But you have to be careful because it does have a very minty scent, so if you have sensitive skin or if you’re sensitive to smells, you won’t like it."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Best for summer,I’m really not big fan of face mist.I received this one as gift.the glass packaging is so cool and it has amazing minty smell !the kore minty mist not only refreshing it also has amazing benefits for skin keep my skin hydrating and fresh all day.I also used this before and after makeup .I highly recommend this mist.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,A nice most for everyday use,"This is a really nice mist for everyday use. I do enjoy the mint smell on the face, but I don’t know if this would negatively affect someone who has sensitive skin. It gives a nice natural smell. I don’t think it makes makeup last longer, but I don’t use it for that purpose. I really only use it to calm powders or to give a specific finish to my skin that a mist can give. Really enjoy this and the glass component is so luxe in the hand too!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Sooo refreshing,I am so impressed with this Minty Mineral Hydration Mist from Kora Organics! It is super refreshing and perfect for the summer! I’ve been using this as a midday refresher to give my skin a boost of hydration and glow. It’s minty scent makes it so calming and soothing! Highly recommend this!
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Fresh Scent and Hydrating,"This was my first experience with a facial mist, and I definitely was missing out. The bottle is gorgeous, and the color is one of my absolute favorites. I also really like the piece of mineral that is inside the bottle. It is a unique touch.  I love that it smells so fresh and minty without being overpowering. It is hydrating and helps keep my dry skin at bay. It’s just so easy to use and smells nice. It provides a gentle glow and is absolutely refreshing."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Can’t get over the smell,This product isn’t as good as I thought it would be. The fragrance is SO STRONG. Like bathroom cleaner and gave me no hydration. I am quite disappointed.  The mist itself is super fine though so I will continue to use the bottle at the very least.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Very Refreshing,This is a very refreshing and hydrating mist! I spray it on in the morning and night time if I need a quick refresh to my skin. It does have a nice minty smell as well. It gives a nice glow to the skin. The packaging is very beautiful with the little crystal inside as well. The mist is also very fine
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,"I’m not really a face mist fan but I was curious to try out this one from Kora Organics because I love minty smells. The mint scent was way too overpowering for me though, it was like spraying peppermint gum all over my face sadly. There’s a rose quartz inside the bottle to “energize” and I thought there was something broken at first lol. As for the hydrating properties, I wasn’t wowed - it was just like any other face mist where you feel slightly hydrated at first and that feeling fades quickly. Another face mist that failed to sell face mists as a necessary product to me. Some pros are that the bottle is made of glass and the mister distributes product equally."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Minty hydration,"The packaging is so cool and the product is so refreshing on the skin. It has minty fragrance and once it is sprayed on the skin, it instantly makes the skin hydrated, cool and calm.

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,So refreshing!,"Super refreshing and perfect to put in the fridge before application.

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Very fine mist,I absolutely love the packaging of this mist. It looks so beautiful in my favorite mint color. Mist is very nice too. It has fine mist and cooling effect. Very much hydrating. Scent is a bit strong but I like it!
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,I really love this spray mist so much. It sprays the most fine mist and it doesn’t produce huge droplets on the face they would ruin your foundation or the layers of skincare I have underneath. The smell is so refreshing. This is summer staple for me now!
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Summer Must-Have,"This has quickly become one of my go-to summer skincare products. I love this mist! The spray comes out in a very fine mist.  I LOVE the way it comes out much better than other mists I use.

It instantly cools, hydrates, softens, and nourishes. I have dry skin, and this gives an instant boost. The mint is refreshing and awakening. It reminded me of mouthwash, and I have to remember not to spray my mouth because it smells so good. 

This is also fantastic for setting makeup. The packaging is gorgeous, and this is a very high quality product. I definitely recommend this! This product was kindly gifted to me. All opinions are my own. I hope to try more products from Kora after the amazing experience I have had with this product, my new summer staple."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Minty Face Hydrator!,"Really enjoy the Kora mist! The smell is strong - herbal and minty and it feels very hydrating on my skin. Refreshes powdery makeup well. I can tell that it has a nice fine mist nozzle, unfortunately mine kind of leaks when spraying so the mister doesnt work well (my only complaint). Everything else is great! :)"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,"Everything about this mist is wonderful except for the smell. I thought having a peppermint scented spray in the summer time would be heavenly when in reality it’s just not for me. Other then that, it applies nicely, doesn’t leave my face sticky and the packaging is adorable. This mist was gifted to me by Kora in exchange for an honest review."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,Gifted by Kora organics. I was super excited to try this because I have dry skin. Trust me it did not disappoint. This mist gives me the hydration my skin is missing. I love it so much it’s part of my daily skincare routine. The only con I see is that some people might not enjoy the minty smell.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,"Nice, refreshing face mist",This mineral mist is so refreshing and great for these hot Florida summers! I like to keep one in my beach bag or car to use when it’s hot outside. Smells nice and has a cute packaging too! Def recommend

KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Minty Refreshing Hydrating,I’ve been absolutely enjoying the mist. Has an ultra fine mist which makes perfect for me to use apart of use apart of my skincare prep and refreshing my makeup through out these hot summer days. I really love mist like this as it does help extend the life of my makeup. Especially as ive tried doing more light coverage products. Only thing I’ll say was odd if you overly shake the bottle when you first spray it can leak out a small squirt. So I’d recommend spraying out 1 or2x before spraying mist to face. Which I don’t feel it’s a big deal as ive had this happen to many for mist and setting sprays. Just need to be prepared.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,"Great Hydrating Mist, Be Aware of Scent!","Really enjoy using this hydrating mist, it’s perfect for the summer. No irritation, no sticky feeling left on my face. It just leaves my skin feeling refreshed and hydrated! The smell is something you should consider before purchasing. If you don’t like the smell of mint, I wouldn’t recommend, the smell is pretty strong and lingers for a little while. If that doesn’t bother you, you’d love this. It’s perfect for the hot summer days to refresh your face and rehydrate!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,A Heavenly Pick-me-up,"The fresh scent of this hydration mist compliments it nicely and it soaks right in, I absolutely love Palo Santo and the smell of it mixed with the mint is heavenly. I keep mine in the fridge and it feels amazing to mist on my face after I get out of the shower or any time I need a boost.  There’s no stickiness or residue left behind, and the organic botanicals and minerals provide my skin with antioxidants and hydration.  A great way to stay refreshed all Summer long."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,"I received this Minty Mineral Hydration Mist complimentary from KORA Organics in exchange for my honest review. This is an okay face mist, but it doesn't feel hydrating enough to me even with extra sprays. This mist has a minty scent, but not exactly in a pleasant way. I wasn't a fan of this face mist to be honest. Though I did appreciate that it wasn't too sticky since some face mists tend to be a little sticky. The packaging is really pretty too!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Invigorating:,"This product is perfection for setting your refreshing your makeup through out the day. It’s lightweight, not sticky and has a great refereeing smell. I can’t attest to it giving you any more longevity in your makeup but i do like the fact that it takes away any powdery finish you may have in your makeup and make it look more skin like"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Minty goodness,"If you are looking for an organic face mist, the Minty Mineral Hydration Mist by Kora is one that shouldn’t be overlooked. This face mist increases moisture and leaves your skin hydrated and glowing. 
Claims: 
Suitable for dry skin. 

Deeply hydrates and moisturizes.

Helps to reduce the appearance of 
skin's sebum and look less shiny.

Helps to calm and soothe your skin.

Targets concerns of dryness, redness, pores, and dullness

My thoughts: 

I love how this smells. Mineral-rich peppermint oil and purifying palo santo energize and invigorate, while a fragrant blend of rosemary, orange peel, sandalwood, and basil offers aromatherapy benefits to uplift the senses. It reminds me of being pampered at a spa. It definitely gives me an extra boost of moisture that my dry skin needs. I found it really fascinating that this product is filtered through Rose Quartz to infuse the vibration of love into the products.  I really think everyone should try this product out and discover for themselves  the power of Organic skincare and the Noni Glow."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Love at first mist!! Amazing!!,"Kora Organics!  I’m in love at first spritz! 

  Firstly this packaging is beautiful.. it’s a lovely recyclable glass bottle and just feels so nice.   I have dry skin so I am always looking for hydration and especially love mists in my routine, either before serums or moisturizer, to lock in makeup, or just to refresh throughout the day.    This mist does it all and it does it very well.  

It’s called Minty Mineral Mist and it is MINTY — but in a very summery, fresh, mint iced tea kind of way.  It’s not overpowering or intense on the scent.   I LOVE it. 

What it is doing for my skin throughout the day is absolutely stunning.  It’s giving me a burst of hydration, a natural glow, and it’s leaving my skin so soft and refreshed without messing up makeup.  The mist is just right.    

Let’s talk about ingredients and benefits!   It’s got Aloe (hydration) MicroAlgae (more moisturizing) , Blue Daisy (antioxidant/soothes skin), Sea Water (minerals for radiance) and is even energized with Aquamarine Crystal during manufacturing which is thought to calm and soothe your spirit along with your skin.. That part is just cool.   I feel soothed alright.. and radiant and hydrated.    

So along with loving this product I’m really impressed with the brand -  it’s cruelty free, certified organic, no synthetic fragrance, focuses on recyclable packaging and sustainability…   

I give this the highest rating.. well deserved!  I’m excited to check out more from this brand.. this is a fabulous mist!"

This product is absolutely lovely!!! The peppermint isn't too overwhelming and reminds me of being at a spa, or something else very relaxing. This will be my new go-to product to use at work when I'm stressed out. Also the mist is incredibly fine, which is very important to me. Wonderful product!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Nice fine mist.,I love a fine mist during the summer. This one is really nice in terms of the actual mist. It’s super fine and has a nice spread. The bottle is stunning and the crystal inside is a beautiful touch. The smell of this mist is very earthy/minty. It’s actually a perfect match with what they describe and I’m not sure if I love it yet. The spray is very soothing and nice. Leaves the skin feeling hydrated and looking nice. I use it both with and without makeup and haven’t had any issues. Gifted by Kora
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,A savior for hot summer days!,"I think this mist is an absolute savior in these scorching hot summer days. The skin is definitely suffering in this heat, so it’s really nice to have a product like this to refresh and hydrate your face. The touch of mint leaves a nice cooling feeling for a while after I use it. I also love that the brand incorporates healing crystals in this product (like rose quartz for example). They have a very powerful energy. Overall, I am absolutely loving this mist. Thanks Kora for keeping me cool in the summer!"

I like the light minty fragrance, and the fine mist that it puts out. I also like that includes minerals and you can use it to refresh makeup."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Smells weirdly minty,"Kora organics gifted this product to me in exchange for my honest review. First of all, the scent of this mist is extremely unpleasing. It has a minty smell to it but in a very odd kind of a way. Feels like smelling a toothpaste. As far as the mist goes, its very fine and nice just the way i like it. It does have some very nice and refreshing ingredients in here which can provide a sense of freshness on a hot summer day but i dont think i will reach for it as often as i would've liked because of the scent. If you are someone who doesnt mind the scent then please go for it."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Smells good!,I was really intrigued by this product especially since it has mint in it. It didn’t irritate my sensitive skin and the mint scent isn’t overwhelming. If you are sensitive to smell this is not for you. I like the bottle to and it feels and looks luxurious. I would recommend this to you to try out.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Refreshing for summer,"The Kora Minty Mist is the summer product I didn’t realize I needed. The most is super fine. The smell is just enough minty. It feels amazing on hot summer skin. 
I use this as a wake me up throughout the day. I want an endless supply of this stuff!"
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Minty fresh,"Kora organics gifted me the minty mineral Hydration mist . I am a new Kora organics fan and have yet to be disappointed by any other products. 

This hydration mist has been as great as I expected. The hydration mist comes in a seafoam green glass bottle with gold detail on the top.  It sprays out an ultra fine mist  that I find incredibly delightful and smells minty fresh. 

I find that two sprays are enough but I like to go with a few more especially if I’m out in the hot Texas weather. Once applied it leaves your face with a cooling effect in your face is left looking refreshed and hydrated. The featured ingredient is aquamarine, Which is a stone that is believed to help soothe your face and calm down redness."
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Nice mist!,I really like this! It’s hydrating and refreshing plus has vitamins/minerals/antioxidants in it from the list of awesome ingredients. The fact that it has aloe is great too for summertime. It can be used after cleansing which is my preference but it can also be used to refresh makeup. It’s also vegan.
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Kora Organics By Miranda Kerr Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,This is a really lovely hydrating face mist. It has aloe vera and sea water that I think help calm and soothe my skin. This mist is a great step after cleansing my face. I also like putting it in the fridge to create an even more refresher. I think it is a bit pricey but can be worth it!
KORA ORGANICS BY MIRANDA KERR-Minty Mineral Hydration Mist,USA,Energizing & Invigorating Minty Mist!,"I've been testing out this minty mineral hydration mist from Kora Organics.. and I've truly been loving it thus far! It feels incredibly nourishing to the skin, and does a beautiful job at prepping the skin for makeup, both prior to application, and after when you need a little pick me up. I love the minty sensation that gives you this energizing feeling. It almost invigorates you and brings your senses alive. Do not be intimidated by the minty aspect, as this isn't anything overpowering. It's more of a beautiful, subtle mint. You can really feel the charge of the crystals within this mist, and what I love most is that actually has a aquamarine crystal inside of the bottle.. which may I add is my birthstone btw. So that already gets a bonus right off the bat. Not to mention the stunning luxurious glass packaging, which feels very luxe & sturdy. Love! I would absolutely recommend this product, for so many different reasons. Definitely makes me want to try more organic products such as this one! Very impressed Kora Organics!"
DRGL-Toner Oil Control,Singapore,"No Frills, Solid Product","Right before I wrote this review, I turned to my friend sitting next to me and asked, “is my face less oily than usual?”

She proceeded to put her hand on my face and happily reported back that my face was indeed less oily, in spite of the fact that I’ve been out and about for the past 14 hours.

This product really helped me to feel less slick and gross throughout the day. (I mean there’s still a bit but I think it’s the base level of oil that a human is mean to have on their face)

10/10 would recommend."
SHISEIDO-Waso Fresh Jelly Lotion,Singapore,Not a fan,"No idea why, but this one gives me breakouts unlike the rest of Shiseido products, esp in this range. "
SHISEIDO-Waso Fresh Jelly Lotion,Malaysia,moderate,"it's toner? I'm not really sure lol. it's thick consistency made me feel that I shouldn't apply a moisturizer after, else my skin will be so greasy. so usually I'll just apply this after cleansing. it was just OK. not suitable to use on a hot day or it will be sticky on your face."
SHISEIDO-Waso Fresh Jelly Lotion,Singapore,love it!,"Love this jelly lotion and the gel to water formula! It’s extremely easy to apply and absorbs into the skin instantly, no sticky or oily feeling at all. The smell is pleasant but quite strong so some may not fancy that. "
SHISEIDO-Waso Fresh Jelly Lotion,,worse product!!!,right after using this product the next day i woke up with super lots of little bumps on my face. dare not give it a second try! it’s a waste of money
SHISEIDO-Waso Fresh Jelly Lotion,,hydrating ,"Bought this to try. Nice to use. Feel the skin so hydrated after use. Will definitely go for second purchase again.  Cheaper compare to other Shiseido lotion. 
"
SHISEIDO-Waso Fresh Jelly Lotion,Malaysia,Okay I guess. ,I’ve started using this product 3 weeks ago. The packaging is cute and the product is jelly-like. But so far I haven’t seen any significant improvement or changes on my skin. It is not drying. This product reminds me of Chanel Hydra Beauty Lotion (Very Moist). They’re almost the same in terms of texture and both have nice smell. But Chanel is better. Just spend a little bit more. 
SHISEIDO-Waso Fresh Jelly Lotion,,Tried the miniature. Was amazing so I purchased 2 in 1 go.,I first tried the miniature of this product because I was not so sure about jelly lotion concept. Previously Im always using liquid lotion. Used this product for some time and it really gives an amazing moisture boost to my skin. It uses Tremella Polysaccharide which I saw online to be the next best moisturizing botanical ingredient. LOVE it LOVE it.
SHISEIDO-Waso Fresh Jelly Lotion,,Good,"Shiseido's new WASO Collection is geared toward Millennial females and makeup minimalists who are busy, on the go, and are looking for a simplified skin care routine. There are many things to like when you first use the Fresh Jelly Lotion. The texture is very gel-like until it warms on your skin and turns into a light-feeling liquid. It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling and looking healthier. Immediately after you apply you will notice a very strong scent to the lotion. "
SHISEIDO-Waso Fresh Jelly Lotion,,ms,"Smells good, looks nice, works fine, may purchase again when  run out. Good for combi skin, not so for oily skin. Nice flip-top bottle cap design. May be used twice daily for extra hydration "
SHISEIDO-Waso Fresh Jelly Lotion,,love it!,"Definitely my favourite product i bought, it can act as a toner/serum and it certainly hydrates and does not have a sticky finish like other hydrating lotion/cream. It also smells really good!"
SHISEIDO-Waso Fresh Jelly Lotion,,BEST TONER EVER,"Great for sensitive skin. My skin gets irritated easily by products, and suprisingly i did not break out in hives after applying this. It is moisutirising with high water content. It is also said to relieve some inflammation on your skin - proven. Overallh great product."
SHISEIDO-Waso Fresh Jelly Lotion,,WASO range,"I bought this product not knowing this range is for younger skin.
Like the scent and jelly-like texture but a bit drying for older skin maybe.
Bottle is plastic and light which is easy to carry on travel. "
SHISEIDO-Waso Fresh Jelly Lotion,,Great lotion,"This has been my go-to lotion ever since I got it as it not only leaves my skin soft and smooth, it is also not heavy on the skin so you can layer this with other skincare products. Great for both day and night time use! The scent is also quite mild and feels soothing, I highly recommend this :)"
SHISEIDO-Waso Fresh Jelly Lotion,,Ms,I am absolutely in love with it! Just a little product will give your skin instant hydration and your skin stays hydrated throughout the day / night. It does have a scent but it isn't a strong smell.

LAB SERIES-Anti-Age Max LS Water Lotion,Malaysia,Anti-Age Max LS Lotion,This product feels more like an anti-aging serum than a lotion.

I purchased more before it run out of stock. "
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Malaysia,Quite harsh ,First time trying this brand. i read all the positive review about the product  however the toner makes my face sticky and oily. I have sensitive skin. definitely not worth for me
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Australia,Pore Clarifying Toner,"This toner is quite strong and effective. It’s good for oily and combination skin. It’s reduces inflammation. A bit sticky, but I will leave it for about 10 minutes and remove it by gentle toner and after use normal moisturiser."

SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Decent Toner,"This is a nice toner - it does a basic job, but I can't say it's lifechanging or amazing. For the price, it's a good value, but I haven't experienced any noticeable changes in my skin. If you're looking for a decent priced toner to keep your skin maintained, this would be a good choice. I'm trying to really improve my skin some, so this wasn't a homerun for me."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Australia,Stings my skin,Heard good things about Saturday Skin so I started with this toner. Really stings my skin! To the point of my skin getting irritated and red after wiping my face with it. I guess some people like the stingy feeling? This one isn’t for me.

SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Malaysia,good,Been using this for almost one month now and i love it! It does not irritate my skin and its very gentle on the skin. Love the packaging as well since its glass
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Australia,Happy with this product ,So this just feels strong on the skin. I have sensitive skin and didn't get a reaction or anything it just feels really strong like it might cause a reaction. BUT I believe that it a good thing if you want to reduce pores and even out skin tone. Over time this does work. It reminds me of Alpha H Liquid Gold if any of you have tried that. Because it reminds me so much of that product I only wear it at night. Feel like there is acidity in this product so I don't want to go outside with it on my face. This this is more a psychological thing.. I am sure you can go outside with it! But this does work over time I like it and I recommend it. 
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Must keep stocked,I have order this product twice in a year it lasting. I can say It work on my pores very nicely. I use several products at at time so I believe so.  I’m black woman with darker skin doesn’t help with my blemishes.

I wanted to try this particular toner because I live in AZ and my pores are huge when I wake up in the morning.  Oily face!  I've been using this toner for about 2 weeks and it's made a big difference.  I'll continue to use this product but it does have a ginger kind of smell to it and it does tingle for a few seconds when you apply it. But this stuff works!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,"I have tried MANY toners. This one is honestly the only one I have ever noticed really any difference in my skin. My skin is smoother, brighter, and I am much less acne prone!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,New Zealand,tingles it works,beautiful skin is just a tingle away. been using for a week now and my pores are smaller and my skin feels amazing. love it! feels a bit stingey on some of my spots but even that makes me feel like it's working hehe.
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Canada,At least try it...,"This is one of the better toners I’ve used. It may tingle or burn at first, but it settles quickly. This had little to no scent, goes on smooth, and seemed to target problem areas such as pores/dirt/oil, thus reducing any blemishes (acne)."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,Very good product and worked for me. Used one bottle and my acne scars are faded away.
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Canada,Not sure what its supposed to do??,I used this entire bottle as directed (every 2nd day) and saw zero difference....
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,IT REALLY WORKS,This has done wonders for my skin. I use it every morning and every night after I use my cleanser. The glycolic acid being 10% really helps my face to naturally speed up the cell turnover rate for fresher healthier looking skin. Love this - GET IT!
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,New Zealand,so clean,i loved the reviews on this product to why i got it and im ao happy i did. i use this up to 5 days a week and it doesn't dry my skin out which is amazing.
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,soothes itchy bumps,"I've recently been getting keratosis pilaris, hives and rashes whenever I eat anything, especially on my arms and calves. It gets super itchy and inflamed. I have stated using this toner sometimes on its and sometimes under my moisturizer. Though it's ability to reduce inflation is limited, it does a great job of soothing the itchiness and gives me relief. As a facial toner it dries really fast, but makes my face feel soft and supple overall."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Great!!!,"I'm loving using it! I use it three times a week and in one week I have already felt a good difference, mainly in the size of my pores. It is composed of 10% Glycolic Acid, which exfoliates the skin and helps to shrink pores; Witch Hazel, which is a plant that helps to balance the skin, improving texture and tone; and Sodium PCA, which supports skin's natural moisture factor. It is indicated for all skin types, but mainly for those who want to shrink pores and make the skin more uniform."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Canada,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,"I got this to help with my post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation/post-inflammatory erythema. Basically the red marks left behind from old acne. This has been helping, I’m almost done my first bottle and I do see a difference. Can’t say it’s to the point where I feel comfortable not concealing the marks with makeup.. but it’s a noticeable improvement. I would recommend this for lightening up some spots and keeping acne at bay. About to go purchase my second bottle!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Canada,Amazing!,"I tried this on a whim since I've been needing a toner. I've been using it for a few weeks and I'm already seeing improvements! My skin has enlarged pores and I get pretty oily. It stings quite a bit on the first couple of tries but I adjusted by the third time I tried it. It's reduced the size of my pores, evened out my complexion, and it reduced the amount of oil I typically get! I do find that if I stop using it for more than 2 days my breakouts return, but I'd like to give it the benefit of the doubt since I'm probably still adjusting to it. But overall, it's a great product!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,I’ve had this Product for over a month now and let me tell you it’s the BEST! Before I purchased this product my skin was breaking out and I would say sometimes because of wearing a mask all day but once I started using this atleast 3x a week it’s cleared my break outs and has totally minimized my pores! I was skeptical at first because when it comes to using skin products I get scared to try new things but I 100% recommended giving this a try!
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,By far the best toner I have used. I am on my second bottle now. Probably will not be changing from this.
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Canada,I love this product!!!,I have sensitive skin but this toner does not irritate my skin.
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Bye bye dry patches,This is such a great toner. It does have a slight tingly feeling but it’s not strong. I can already see a difference in my skin. I have almost no dry patches and my pores look smaller!
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,by far best,"This is by far the best toner I've ever used and is my go to. It shrunk my pores, got rid of my acne (unless I try some new product that causes me to breakout or something) and I can feel confident going without makeup!! It tingles and feels refreshing but when I 1st bought it, it kind of burned a little but I don't have that issue now that my skin has got used to it. I am so happy I bought this and use it at least 3x a week, if not daily."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Canada,Game changer,"I cannot say enough good things about this toner. It's completely helped get rid of my acne, faded scars, shrunk my pores, given my skin such a beautiful healthy glow, and helped with my oily skin. I was also shocked at at quickly it started working. I started noticing significant changes in my skin within the first few days. Definitely a miracle in a bottle!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,AMAZING!,This is my new holy grail night toner. I have tried other AHA’s like The Ordinary etc. This one tingles much more and my face was much brighter/lighter after one use! I’m a red head with lots of freckles on my face so I’m always looking for something to help lighten them and this is it! The texture is thicker than a normal toner but not as the as the watermelon toner from glow recipe. I also have some acne/small white heads and milia plus huge pores. Salicylic acid does not work for me at all. This has also helped with all of that! Seriously nothing has done anything like this to my skin. There is no smell but my skin feels nice and plump. Make sure to wait 15-20 minutes before adding your serums and moistureizer. I would not recommend for sensitive skin! I highly recommend to everyone else especially oily acne prone skin.
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Canada,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,"I used it for the first time yesterday. Already I notice a huge difference, like night and day. Skin is instantly smooth and soft. Love it!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Skin saver!,This toner is definitely strong and tighten big pores and reduces blemishes. I began using it daily for several days then reduce until needed. I wish the package comes with a top roller to reduce the waste.
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,not for me,"There’s better options out there, might be skin compatibility, but this did nothing to help my pores."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Canada,The Best Toner...,"This is sooo good in my skin, been using it for 7 weeks now and it really makes my skin clear from those little bumps with white heads. In my first 3 weeks, i used it every night and layer it with Glow Recipe Plum Pump Hyaluronic Serum. And after 3 weeks, i use it every other night coz i started using a night mask in between. The smell isn’t that great tho, but it’s tolerable."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Game Changer,"I have never left a review but had to for this toner! I have received several compliments on how flawless my skin looks. I have combination skin with a very oily t-zone and have used this for ~2 months now and my skin has never looked better. I’ve noticed my skin gets less oily and pores do look smaller. I apply it every day after double cleansing at night (does slightly burn but my skin does not get red). After it dries, I only apply moisturizer! It’s pricey but worth it"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Feel the Burn,"Yes it is true there is a burning sensation. I was not the exception. My skin is combination and sensitive so I proceeded with caution. The first 2 uses my skin did feel the burn and had a slight reaction to it. So I had to watch out for that. By the third use my skin had gotten used to it and calmed down. It is a great product and definitely see the difference. 

Note: I used it 3 times in a week, every other day."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Malaysia,It irritates ,"My skin tolerance level is quite high, but this break it outs in just few times used. Such big bottle being wasted. Will definitely not to repurchase and recommend to any type of skin."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,really the most effective toner I’ve tried,"I never really had faith in toners and always thought they were unnecessary, but with this I noticed effects almost immediately and results quickly. The first time I used this was at night, washed it off in the morning, and did my normal makeup routine. I have oily skin but noticed my pores looked smaller and I didn’t get oily throughout the day, so my makeup stayed matte much longer! My skin has been consistently less oily since then. I’ve been using this for a week and it really has helped fade acne scars/dark spots and reduce redness, and at the same time it hydrates my skin. I can’t wait to see the results after a few more weeks of use."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,great toner!,"So far, I've only used this product for 11 days, but I'm really liking it!  My skin had been feeling rough, with a lot of dead skin cells that I could never quite get rid of, for a couple months.  It was kind of annoying. I would try to exfoliate it away, and it would just keep coming back.  So I decided to give this a shot, and I would say within just a few times using it, my skin is now pretty smooth. I'm very pleased. No effect so far on my very large pores, but I'm not expecting it to. Large pores generally can't be fixed.

Also, the toner has no real smell, in my opinion. Just slight. I also don't think this toner is very strong... it doesn't sting my skin like some reviewers have said. Maybe I just don't have sensitive skin, because I can use this product every day (even though it's recommended on the bottle to only use it 3-5 times per week).  I actually found that I need to use it every day to keep my skin smooth."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Malaysia,Good product ,"Scent is a bit strong but it works well on skin. After using half of the bottle, skin seems to improved. More smooth and less visible pores. Still using it but only during the day. "
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,GREAT PRODUCT,I purchased this without reading the instructions and thought I would use it everyday.  I was mistaken - it’s advised to use it 3-5 times a week.  I used it twice and after the second time I noticed that my skin became soft and clean like after a peel. My skin has never looked this great after using any toner so I’m very happy with the results and this product.  It tingles just a little bit when applying it. I think everyone needs to have this to keep their skin looking pure in between chemical peels.
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,not a bad option but...,"I have been using Ren AHA toner. It was unavailable and is super $ anyway, so I tried this. If if I hadn’t used Ren before, I would have loved it. Does a solid job and if you don’t have super pores like me, it will probably work fine. I’m going to spend the extra money and get the Ren- best toner I have ever used!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Canada,This is the toner I was looking for,"For those who experience a bit of acne/breakouts - I highly recommend this toner. I have mildly oil skin, and typically get a few breakouts a month. In a toner I look for ingredients like witch hazel to balance out my skin and this one is IT. After two weeks of use, this toner has been a great astringent without drying my skin. It’s been smoothing and has complimented my skin care routine, I’d say this works best used 4-5 times a week, daily use not required."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Canada,"Good stuff, with caution","This stuff is intense for sure, I mean not so much that it's dangerous - but if you have anything resembling a scratch on your face, don't get this stuff near it because it will BURN, ouch.  I definitely noticed my skin was smoother using this, but didn't really notice a difference in my pores.  I wouldn't recommend using it daily."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Canada,You need this in your life.,This is the best clarifying toner I’ve used in my life and I’ve used soooo many different kinds from Korean to western brands. They gets rid of all of my texture and prevents acne. I hardly get ANY bumps. So great to prevent imperfections. I use it almost every day. I find a waste quite a bit when I pour it on a cotton pad. I put it in a spray bottle and spray a bit of it with some mist like the claudalie grape water and then wipe it all over my skin gently. SO good.
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,great for getting rid of visible pores!,"been using this on and off for a while, and it definitely helps with pores - mine have been getting visibly smaller and less defined after applying daily and my t-zone is much less oily"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,"Great toner!! It does what it says it will do. My face feels incredible after using this. Even after double cleansing, this toner visibly cleans my pores deeply. The evidence is on the cotton pad! Lol"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,22 yr old w/ combo skin,"I’ve had this for a little over a week & already see major improvements on my skin. I have redness, huge pores/blackheads & dullness on days I’m super tired. This has really helped smooth out my skin & make it less oily throughout the day. Highly recommend. Only downside is that it smells like mikes hard lemonade lol"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,"I know this product isn’t intended for acne but every time I start to break out I use this product and I avoid a huge breakout. My skin is noticeably clearer and my hyperpigmentation from pregnancy, acne scars, and sun spots have faded significantly. This product leaves my skin looking so healthy. It will sting if you have any open damaged skin but it’s worth it!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Canada,How to use vs. clinical results?,"More of a question really... the clinical results are based on usage for 4 weeks, 2x daily. Under how to use, it says use 3-5  times per week. So... am I supposed to use it twice daily, or 3-5 times per week? I am excited to use this product, and I will follow the 3-5 times per week, but it does cause me to wonder..."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Great!,I really really love this toner. I’ve been using it for about a month now and it’s made my skin texture disappear almost completely! I’ve also noticed my skin tone is much more even and my pores on my nose are definitely smaller. Overall it’s a great toner and I will purchase again.
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,amazing,This toner is amazing it’s really helps with texture and my dark spots I’m in love
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,I don’t write a lot of reviews I’ve been using this for about two weeks and I love it. I have oily af skin and even though I don’t usually get bad break outs I always have a ton of little bumps on my forehead but they’re completely gone now. Was hesitant to spend so much money on toner but its worth it
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Fast results,"I’m really impressed with this product. I use it when I’m really tired and just clean my face with cleansing wipes— really makes my skin feel clean, more so than just using a cleansing wipe. More importantly, I’ve only been using it for two weeks and I’ve already seen a big difference: *really* tightens the pores on my skin, and smoothes bumpy texture on my cheekbones. 100% will buy again."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Yes!,"my FAVORITE toner, love this product, keeps my skin so clean i never breakout when i use this continuously ! I’ve bought this 3 times already, love"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Good,I have been using this toner for a week. So far my skin looks more brighter and even. These pumps that look like pimples on the side of my face are almost gone. My pores are smaller. I couldn’t be happier. I already ordered 3 more bottles.
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,"So, here’s the deal - I don’t use this on my face. I did buy it with the intention of using it on my face and have used it periodically on my face with good results. However, I love this product for the fact that it got rid of my butt acne. Yep, I said it! It happens. I had gone 28 years without this issue and then I suddenly couldn’t get rid of it. Out of desperation, it started using this daily on my bum and it cleared up completely. It worked so well that I just bought my second bottle! Hooray for clear bums!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Buy it!!!,"im in love! I received a bottle of this in my Boxycharm box and when I run out I'm definitely buying it! My skin looks and feels totally amazing after only using it for two weeks. Dark spots have lighten,  pores have become practically nonexistent,  and my skin is as soft as a baby 's bottom! I love this stuff!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Philippines,beauty journalist @thebeautyedit.ph,"Love this! Non-irritating, but tingly enough to do the job. I’ve completely set aside my all-time favorite acid go-to Pixi for this. For now. Delivers nearly an instant smoothening effect, and a beautiful glow over time. "
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Major burn sensation,Broke me out with a burning sensation. Feels like putting alcohol on face.
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Canada,I found my holy grail!,"Ever since Neostrata got bought out by johnson/johnson, the formula has changed and is 300x more expensive! A lot of the peels either aren't the right concentration I need or doesn't show % glycolic acid. I finally found this wonderful product! My acne is under control and acne scars are fading! I get a nice glow. Bottle says 4-5x a week, but I go by what Neostrata's instructions were which was everyday. Always use sunscreen!!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Love this!,"This toner really changed my skin for the better! After double cleansing I like to use this before serums and since using my acne is almost completely gone, pores are smaller and has helped with my oil problems!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,love is a bottle,"I truly love this product it takes off the makeup that gets left behind, and doesn't dry out your skin."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,"I typically have pretty clear and sometimes sensitive skin, so the tingling sensation many people describe feeling after using this was actually a bit of a burning one for me. This is definitely not a daily toner for me, but when my face does act up and get a bit oily, or if I can still feel makeup residue on my skin, this does great at wiping it all away."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,You need this,"I can’t get enough! This stuff really makes my skin feel clean, pure, and bright. I can’t go a day without it."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,It’s okay,"The second ingredient is witch hazel, which is very off putting to me because witch hazel is an astringent and isn’t good for your skin in the long run. It will definitely age you in the long run. It stings after you use it. I would not recommend this for everyday use. The one good thing about this product is the glycolic acid is a very good exfoliant. It’s definitely not worth the price."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Singapore,sensitive skin - dont like it ,wont repurchase. i have sensitive skin and it tingles upon application. sometimes i'd pop my pimples and it hurts when i apply this toner vs others...
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,A huge glass bottle of a powerful toner with a fantastic chemical exfoliant included. I've really enjoyed using this product because it feels like it's actually helping the texture and glow of my skin.
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,Canada,too many essential oils,Seemed like a good chemical exfoliater...however if your skin is sensitive to essential oils I would avoid this product - caused too much redness for me. Pink ombre glass packaging was nice thou.
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Holy grail,"I’m the type of person who needs to try everything. I cannot settle. When using this product that wasn’t the case. This is now my absolute go to and nothing else compares. I love that it’s natural, safe for my skin and WORKS. You can feel the toner penetrating your face as it tightens your pores and tingles. This stuff is the absolute best."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,First off I love the packaging on this product. Second it works! It does a great job at minimizing pores
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,"Love this product, the packaging is great and feels very well designed. Such a pretty bottle! But most importantly it WORKS. I use this about 3 times per week, it gives you a tingling sensation and maybe a little redness. But my pores were non existent in a week. This is a must try!"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Great stuff,Loved this product made my face feel clean! Packaging was awesome really big and glass!
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Wow!!!!,"Such a good toner! Leaves my skin feeling refreshed, clean, primed, and balanced."

SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,I loved this product! I used it once in the morning to achieve the best results. It smells great and I noticed a difference in my skin while using it. The packaging is lovely too!
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Breakouts :(,I loved the concept of this toner and the pretty packaging but unfortunately I did experience some breakouts so it was difficulty to me to give this a higher rating. I am 22 and have combination skin.
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Great experience,"This is my first experience with a toner and I couldn't be happier! I've seen results since I first used this toner (started a month ago) an my skin feels smoother, my pores look smaller and my skin tone is more even than before. Now that is summer I've been breaking out more than usual, but I think this toner really help with my breakouts as well. 
HOWEVER in order to get results, you need to use it as indicated in the package, please read the package! from 3 to 5 times a week. Also, because of the 10% glycolic acid it is important to use sunscreen afterwards, so please please wear it, specially when going out."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,Cleared up my skin so well! I love the packing and scent as well!
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Must have,So in love with this! I am always on the market for toners. My skin is loving this.
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,This glycolic toner is amazing. First time using it I did not feel any tingling even though it is an exfoliating toner. I’ve actually used this on my chest and shoulders a few time to get rid of some little bumps and they when right about
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,overall l would say that this product is very good but also very strong. l only use it about once a week because l have extremely sensitive skin but overall l would highly recommend
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Great toner,Big fan of this toner! I was worried it would Dry my skin out since it says only to use a few times a week. The formula is lightweight and leaves your skin feeling clean. Even after washing my face this picks up left behind dirt. My skin felt super clean and bright after use. Safe for sensitive skin!
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,This is definitely a strong toner. However it left my skin feeling tacky which I don’t care for so I go over it with Glamglow Super toner (which I love). I personally don’t understand why they felt it was necessary to use a very heavy thick glass bottle? I also had to use Scissors To make the opening bigger as the toner would not come out as it is a slightly thicker consistency than any toner I’ve ever used. Not something I’ll purchase again.
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,I used this product and I was kind of hesitant at first. I’m starting to try and do more with my skincare. I use it about 3 times a week because I do have sensitive skin and try not to use too many products. It tingles a bit when I use it but I just let it sink in and then use my moisturizer. My face feels smoother but a tiny bit tight. I do like the fact that I recognized the ingredients. I loved the packaging as well!
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Love this!,Love love love This toner. Love the size it comes in!
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Great product!,"I really loved this product! It removes all of the dirt off of my face, even after washing my face with face wash."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,"Not good for sensitive skin! I’ve been using this for almost two months now, 2-3 times a week hoping my skin would get used to it but no luck. Any time o use this it makes my skin very red, itchy and causes me to break out in little white bumps on my forehead and cheeks. It is very strong and burns when you apply it and leaves a sticky film over the top of skin. I hate it."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,"I love the packaging! It’s a cute glass bottle. The product feels good on your skin, however, it’s a little gritty to me."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Saturday Skin Pore Clarifying Toner - 125ml,"I’ve been using this for the past 2 weeks. I love the packaging. My skin is noticeably less oily. So far that’s the only thing that has changed for me. It stings a little when I put it on, but goes away just as fast as it started"
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Not for sensitive skin,"Not for sensitive skin, I’m sure this product is great for normal to oily skin. But for someone like me who breaks out easily and has redness it just made it worse. If you have sensitive skin be very careful."
SATURDAY SKIN-Pore Clarifying Toner,USA,Quality,"First of all I love the brand Saturday Skin. Everything you get from the packaging to the product is high quality. The glass bottle looked so nice on my counter. As for the actual toner, it felt light and refreshing without causing a lot of redness like typical toners tend to do. I will continue using!!"
DIOR-Hydra Life Balancing Hydration 2 In 1 Sorbet Water,Malaysia,Decent toner ,"I have oily dehydrated, acne prone, sensitive skin. This toner doesn’t sting and feels hydrating. Doesn’t do harm to my skin but didn’t see much improvements also. I repurchased because I’m yet to find “the one” to be my HG toner. "
DIOR-Hydra Life Balancing Hydration 2 In 1 Sorbet Water,USA,Mediocre,"Mediocre! After washing my face, i use a cotton ball to apply this light toner all over my face and neck. it prepares my skin for the moisturizing steps that follow. it's good, but i've tried better (Shiseido)"

DIOR-Hydra Life Balancing Hydration 2 In 1 Sorbet Water,Canada,Too fragrant,"I got this at Shoppers to help with the dryness I feel after washing my face with regular tap water. Yes, it helps with that but it has too much fragrance for this kind of a product. I would recommend if you don’t mind the fragrance."
DIOR-Hydra Life Balancing Hydration 2 In 1 Sorbet Water,,Dior water,This toning lotion is fresh and hydrating. I like the way it sits on my skin and it isn’t drying. It’s a nice base to my serum and moisturiser. Would purchase again. 
DIOR-Hydra Life Balancing Hydration 2 In 1 Sorbet Water,,Wonderful product,"This toner does wonders to my skin. For reference I have very sensitive/combination skin and this did not cause any breakouts or rashes.

DIOR-Hydra Life Balancing Hydration 2 In 1 Sorbet Water,USA,Not for oily skin.,"I was told that this would help my oily skin, but the product left my skin worse than before. My face became uncontrollably oily, and sticky. It felt like it just sat on top of my face, never really being absorbed into my skin. 
I liked the way it smelled though."
DIOR-Hydra Life Balancing Hydration 2 In 1 Sorbet Water,USA,DIOR Hydra Life Balancing Hydration 2 In 1 Sorbet Water,I have very oily skin to the point where my makeup wouldn’t last more than a half hour before looking awful. After only using this product once it improved my skin significantly. My make up lasted pretty much all day with little oils coming through. I am so happy I found this product and recommend it to anyone suffering with oily skin.
DIOR-Hydra Life Balancing Hydration 2 In 1 Sorbet Water,USA,not for me,I bought this product because I love the scent. But when I got it home and tried it on my face I did not like the way it felt at all. It’s stung a little and did not soak into my face well and the sent actually became overpowering and made me a little nauseous. So disappointed! I’ll be returning this product for sure.
DIOR-Hydra Life Balancing Hydration 2 In 1 Sorbet Water,USA,Non-Irritating+Non Sticky+Lasting Hydration,"Non-irritating. Non-sticky even after I applied layers of it on my face. Intensely hydrating. Without the moisturizer on top of it, the feeling of Hydration given by this product still lasted for hours when I walked in the cold, drying wind. Quick Absorption. I rarely write review but here I am, for the surprise that this product brings me. 

I’ve tried most of the over-hyped toners at Sephora. The Shiseido Revitalizing Essence is what I consider the Best toner, but I literally finished an entire bottle within a month of use, when I was also switching between three toners at a time! The origins is great for night use (since it contains citrus oil, which increases the sensitivity to the sun). The Shiseido White Lucent Infuser is incredibly gentle however too sticky to put on my face. This one achieves the perfect balance and thus is my ideal toner for this season. 

I mean, if I get rich, I’ll probably buy 100 bottles of the Shiseido revitalizing essence and pat in as many layers as I want. But this is why this dior toner is so lovely - it lasts, predictably 3 months, if I don’t go crazy."
DIOR-Hydra Life Balancing Hydration 2 In 1 Sorbet Water,USA,"Don't try it, you will need it every day!","I tried it at Sephora Pointe-Claire with Dior Representative. I can't tell how much I LOVE the feeling when I put it on my face after I washed it. It's a relief and I love the smell. But when I did it on my Sister's face, I could see instantly the impact! The wrinkles of her forehead have dissipated when I was applying that product! This product is so amazing, beneficial! Try it after cleaning your face, before applying your face cream. Worth every penny. 

I bought it. and I will never pass a day without it anymore!"
DIOR-Hydra Life Balancing Hydration 2 In 1 Sorbet Water,USA,DIOR Hydra Life Balancing Hydration 2 In 1 Sorbet Water,"Love this product! I also bought the Essence, they two are perfect! My skin used to very dry, but now looks more hydrated than before, recommended!"
DIOR-Hydra Life Balancing Hydration 2 In 1 Sorbet Water,USA,"Not the Same, but worth a shot!","I'm on the fence about 3-4 stars BUT it is because I was trying to replace the Dior that I've used for years in the Pink bottle, that is no longer being made.  The fragrance was a bit strong, but very nice.  I have to be honest, I found the Pink bottle somewhere, so I didn't use this but a few days.  Will most likely try again when I have exhausted all supplies of my favorite."

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Australia,The perfect hydrating toner ,"Despite the toner step being deemed 'unnecessary' by many beauty and skin care experts, I personally really love it. Especially now that I'm using a properly hydrating toner! I initially went into store to get a tester of the Fresh rose toner but the Sephora staff member recommended this instead considering I have extremely dry skin. She also noted that the perfume and smell of the Fresh was quite strong, so I'm glad I didn't go ahead with it!

This baby just soaks right in and while I was initially sceptical about the oat smell, it disappears instantly. I used this in combo with the Ultra Repair Cream and just as a test, I omitted the toner from my routine to see how much hydration it really adds. The answer? A lot!!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Love this- every time I put it on it feels like glacier water on my skin it’s so calming and cooling.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,Great!,"I’d say this product is really amazing when it comes to hydration all day, it has begun to heal my hyperpigmentation. But overnight, it gives me little pimples. They go away in a day or so, it just leaves my skin a little bumpy. But during the day use at work, my skin is super super soft!!! Smells great too"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,finally!!!,I have struggled all my life with finding skin care products that doesn’t take a layer of skin off.

Every toner would either burn my skin or make me break out. I was honestly skeptical about buying this toner because of the price…but I am SO glad I did. It feels amazing on my skin and a little goes a long way. Also I think the best way to apply would be to pat directly onto skin with your fingers. The milky texture makes your skin feel so hydrated & smooth!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,It’s pretty hydrating. But I have had more pimples than before since I use it. Not good for acne-prone skin.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,#1 skincare product for dry skin,"This product would get ten stars from me! I never want to be without it.. I have been using it since last fall. I live in very dry, cold, windy climate in the winter and always struggle keeping my skin hydrated throughout. I end up with eczema patches on my eyelids every winter. This was the first winter I kept on top of my skin and made it the entirety without any flare ups or major dry issues. The consistency is milky and super easy to apply. A little goes a long way. I have used it every single night and still have 1/4 of a bottle left. I just pat into my skin with my hands on damp clean skin right after cleansing and voila this dry skin has stayed hydrated!! I never thought I'd find a product that would accomplish this so effortlessly. Will be a staple product in my skin care routine as long as its available!!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,New Zealand,where has this been all my life?,After the first use I discovered what all the raving reviews were about.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,"IF YOU ARE BREAKING OUT FROM LANEIGE, USE THIS","Even despite going on accutane, my face would react horribly to Laneige. I would wake up to closed comedones, cystic acne, and all the nasties every day until I stopped using Laneige cream skin toner. I was devastated because I really wanted the hydration. Luckily, this came into my life. if you are like me and react horribly to the Laneige, I would highly highly suggest trying this one. It’s so good, and it feels so nice."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Canada,MILKY TEXTURE,The best toner ever. I like that this toner is inherently different from others. It has a milky texture to it as shown in the photo attached and is incredibly hydrating. Great for those with combo oily skin
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,sensitive/dry skin must-have!,I don’t know how this toner isn’t viral yet.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,"Best toner I've used. I typically get severe eczema breakout patches on my forehead and the sides of my nose. (Super red, dry, itchy flaky)
Since I've added this to my daily routine, I rarely get any angry patches. I find applying a generous amount with my fingers works best for me and then letting it dry for a minute before adding my serum and moisturizer."

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Australia,a winter must have ,"Absolutely love this product, it smells so clean and feels great on my skin. Absolutely a must have for my winter skincare routine, gives it that hydration it needs. "

and can be easily layered underneath 
moisturizer. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,NOT HYDRATING ENOUGH,"I have normal to dry skin and this toner didn’t feel hydrating at all. Ive been using it for about 3 weeks and it doesn’t seem to have made an improvement in my skin. It also smells like hand soap.  If you have dry skin, try laneige cream to skin toner or the cosrx toner. 
This toner would be better for oily skin types."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Australia,FIRST AID BEAUTY  Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,I just pat this on my face and have found this product and hydrating soothing for my sensitive skin. It doesn't irritate or sting in anyway and you don't need to use a lot of it.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,love it,I love it so much. It is so hrydrating and I can feel a difference when I don’t use it. Once I forgot to bring it with me for vacation and my skin went back to being all dry and sensitive! It just helps me a lot and is very soothing.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Malaysia,First Aid Toner ,So good and reasonable price. Im mid 50s The toner really Hydrating and smooth texture. Compared to other brands this worth the price. i will repurchase.  Love love ❤️ 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,Works great!,"It dried out my skin once for some reason after I first started using it. Ever since then, it’s worked really well for me. I just have to make sure it doesn’t sit on my skin for too long before following up with moisturizer."

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,Saved my skin,"I love love love this toner. My skin is sensitive and gets pretty dry in the winter and this always saves my skin.

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Canada,BEST hydrating toner that got rid of my PIE,"I honestly have no clue why this product isn’t extremely hyped up because it works SO well. I’ve been perfecting my skincare routine and needed a toner that would help hydrate and reduce my post inflammatory erythema (the red marks after acne that aren’t hyperpigmentation). Although PIE is said to fade on its own and products don’t help, I have noticed a significant difference since adding this to my routine. Because it is so soothing and calming to the skin, it really helps eliminate a lot of the redness. Also, the fact that it has hydrating ingredients creates the optimal environment for skin to heal and help the PIE fade faster. Overall, my skin is so dewy, hydrated and even toned since incorporating this product. Holy grail for sure <3"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,I luvvvv,"The absolute best! I have combo skin but live in Colorado and am constantly looking for ways to boost my hydration — this is it. Very pleasant in texture (think watered down milk), absorbs quickly with no unpleasant residue, keeps my face moisturized, and calms my redness. What’s not to love? I think the product could really work well for anyone because the texture is so easy to work with and it’s so gentle. This is also a pretty unique product imo — you don’t frequently see toners that do anything other than exfoliate with HAs or strip nine layers of skin off with alcohol. I’ve bought maybe 6 bottles of it over the past two years and have no intention of stopping."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Singapore,unsure whether to repurchase,"Bought this for my mil who has very dry skin and was looking for a product that can smooth out her skin and hydrate it at the same time. It was reasonably priced so we thought, not much to lose! She hasn’t requested to repurchase it so far.. perhaps it didnt work as how she expected it to."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Canada,Lovely!,This toner does exactly what it’s meant to do! Soothes and hydrates. I was looking for a toner without AHA/BHA while using another treatment at night that shouldn’t be mixed with actives. Through research I came to the conclusion my breakouts are being caused by a damaged skin barrier so I’ve been working on correcting that. This toner has integrated perfectly into my routine and is a great option for sensitive skin that needs some TLC.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,i have dry skin & this i noticed after 3 days an improvement in my skin tone & everything.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Canada,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,"A really nice hydrating toner that did not break out my sensitive, acne-prone skin."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Canada,Works for rosacea!,This is the first toner I use that actually helps my rosacea! My cheeks usually get really red after shower and this toner really helps calming the redness down. Would recommend :)
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,Did nothing,This did nothing for me honestly. I didn’t even feel the hydration that it claims to provide. Stick with a Hyaluronic essence from a Korean brand if you’re dry and/or dehydrated!!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,It’s Beautiful,"This is my first First Aid Beauty product and I am in love! It soothes and hydrates my skin and I genuinely love this product. My go to toner before was the Pixi Rose Tonic, and this toner is just a bit better when it comes to replenishing my skin and prepping it for me for my actives. I use this one at night and my Pixi tonic durning the day. Would 100% recommend."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,"This is so soothing! I use it every night after washing my face before using the ultra repair cream. My skin is incredibly sensitive and I get hives and irritation easily, this helps calm my face down if I am dealing with those issues."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Canada,FOREVER FAVORITE,"This product will ALWAYS be a staple in my skincare routine! I use it after cleansing and it just hydrates my skin to the point where I feel like I don't even need moisturizer (I do moisturize after because the skin needs an actual moisturizer so don't @ me). I pour some directly into hands, rub together, and massage onto face. It's non-irritating (just look at the ingredients) and bonus, it smells lightly like powdered sugar but the scent doesn't linger. This is such an amazing product!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Malaysia,Average toner,"Not a bad toner, it just doesn’t make my skin better or worst. Overall it is just an average toner with a nice mild oat smell, there is a better toner in the market. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Australia,Gorgeous for thirsty sensitive skin,"I have rosacea and dehydrated skin, and this worked wonders. No irritation, my skin just drank this up and felt soothed afterwards. Watery texture, no fragrance."

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Malaysia,Silky smooth toner,"As I said, it has silky smooth milky texture. Doesn't strip my skin moisture and really hydrate my skin after cleansing. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,average,"I got this as part of one of their holiday sets and ummm there’s not really much to say lol. for starters, i don’t feel like it’s doing anything and is a little overpriced imo. however, it smells so delicious, it like glazed donuts aha."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Australia,great toner,I love this toner. It’s very light and non-sticky. No fragrance which I am a big fan of. Makes skin smooth and hydrated. Other products sit fine over it. It has really kept my eczema away as well I think. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Singapore,Hmmm,"Used this for a few weeks and realised it is not hydrating as it claims to be. Works just right for sensitive/dry skin type, it could be more suitable for  sensitive/normal skin type. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,"This isn’t a terrible product, but I have a couple of issues with it. First of all, I wish the brand would be more transparent about whether or not it was reformulated. The order of the ingredients on the label has changed — now all of the beneficial ingredients are listed after the preservative phenoxyethanol, which means they all come in concentrations of less than 1%. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the ingredients are ineffective or even that the formula was tweaked, but nevertheless, I wish FAB would either confirm or deny that the product has changed. 

The second issue I have is that this product is supposed to be soothing and healing, but it’s made my face burn like crazy on multiple occasions. Granted, I was going through retinization, but other soothing toners I’ve used while my face adjusted to tretinoin didn’t cause this discomfort. If you market your product as a “repair” product and it makes my face burn, I’m going to be disappointed. “Repair” products are the ones I lean on during retinization or when my skin barrier feels damaged, but this only made it worse.

As far as the good things, it has some great ingredients like oats and honey that provide tons of benefits for the skin. The texture is milky and hydrating but it absorbs reasonably quickly. Doesn’t leave you greasy. While not drugstore, price is also not outrageous.

Not 100% sure I’ll restock when I finish my bottle."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Canada,Dried out my skin!,Bought base on reviews and RETURNED IT after two uses.  Totally dried out my skin. My skin was peeling and this was the only addition to my routine. Nothing hydrating about it for my dry to combo skin.  Also the toner has a nauseating sunscreen lotion scent to it.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,Always repurchase this product.,"I really like this toner, it picks up the trace makeup after I cleanse my skin. Not harsh like some other toners I have used."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,Meh,"I was hoping this would add moisture to my dry winter skin, but it really does not seem to do anything."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Australia,Very hydrating,"I'm really enjoying this hydrating toner, it's soothing on the skin. Unfortunately I've since learned that FAB isn't truly cruelty free so I can't repurchase, but if this doesn't bother you then I highly recommend. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,Amazing!,This is the second time I purchase this product. It really helped even out my complexion. I use to get deep dark spots after breakouts but they are smooth now. I highly recommend.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Singapore,very hydrating ,Love this hydrating and brightening toner.  No fragrance and easy to apply.  Easily absorbed by skin and feel hydrating after applying a thin layer on the damp skin.  Will purchase again. 
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,Great and silky smooth toner,Amazing toner; I’ve used a bunch of toners haru haru before but this is the smoothest of all. It actually feels like you’re applying milk to your face.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,Helped my eczema and acne prone skin!,This toner is awesome! I have very sensitive eczema and acne prone skin. I believe this toner (along with my skincare regimine) helped to clear up a pesky patch of eczema around my eyes. I love how you can apply this direcly after washing your face to lock moisture in and soothe skin. Definitely a keeper in my daily routine!
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,Calms and hydrates skin,"I bought this on recommendation from Dr. Dray on YouTube and I'm so glad I did. I had never used it before, but thought worth a try. This toner has a hydrating, calming effect on my skin which has become irritated from using Retin A through prescription. This is now an integral part of my daily routine, and I find I no longer have peeling skin or any inflammation from my retinols. I am ready to purchase a second bottle so that I'll always have a backup supply! It's affordable and can be used with or without a cotton round, you can apply with your fingers. Very nice indeed, and fragrance free!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Canada,HELPED MY DRY SKIN,"II have eczema all over my body, including my face. This product helps so much with dry patches, keeping my hydrated and feeling plump all day. If you have extremely sensitive dry skin I would 100000% recommend this product."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,Better than Clinique!,"Before trying this out, I had used the Clinique toner and it kind of made my skin more dry but cleaned it really well. I wanted a toner that was more hydrating and affordable, so I chose to get this one. 
The texture is different than the clinique toner, so for this I think rubbing it in gently with your fingers is better than using the cotton pads. I would say it is moisturizing and feels nice on my sensitive skin!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Malaysia,repeat order,"Very good, nice design. Worth for the prices, still using.
Good quality, good looking. For normal use. Worth to
buy when 25%. Feeling nice and pretty good. Apps

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Australia,gentle and mild,"I’ve settled for this toner, for now! Really hard to find a decent toner these days. This one is gentle, soothing, mild, cleanses and good value! I really love the feel in my skin and have bought quite a few bottles already. "
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,"I just finished my first bottle of this and have another on the way! The bottle lasted me more than 6 months of 1-2x daily use. It’s certainly not a “necessary” part of a skincare routine but I’ve found it benefits my dry skin, and it something I enjoy using! I rub/pat onto damp skin after cleansing and before any other products. It absorbs quickly and seems to work well with other moisturizing products. I recommend for dry skin!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,USA,great product and value,I’ve been using this morning and night after cleansing for over two months and love it. I’ve barely used half the bottle so this product is a great value as well. I love that it has not scent. It’s absorbs quickly and does not cause my moisturizer or sunscreen to pill when applied over top of it. It really is soothing and has never irritated my redness prone and sensitive skin.
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Canada,Great addition to my routine for fall/winter,"This gives a nice little boost of hydration under my regular moisturizer, which is exactly what I need as the weather gets colder. I also use this as a buffer between my skin and a prescription retinoid, to reduce irritation. You don’t need much, so the bottle should last a very long time."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Australia,Better than the Laneige (milky toner)! ,"This toner is like a big drink of water 💦 for your skin. It's milky 🥛 so I spill a tiny bit on my palms and just tap it into my skin and then apply serums and creams. It gives my skin that healthy hydrated look. It looks great under the makeup (I'm combo, super oily forehead). The ingredients are bomb! My skin loves everything with oat, ot reduces any redness and irritation (beautiful ingredient, especially in FAB products), other ingredients are awesome too. It's very similar to the Laneige one, but better (also price wise). Little goes a long long way! "

FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Australia,Favourite toner ever!,"This is the best toner I have ever used! It is super gentle, feels really light on my skin and it hydrates so well. Have repurchased this many times and I don't think I can use anything else!!! I would definitely recommend giving it a go!"
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Canada,wonderful lightweight moisture and calming,"AMAZING stuff. Helps with calming irritated skin, can be used as a very lightweight moisturizer (hint: use as AM moisturizer where your mask goes to prevent acne) and works well for sensitive skin. Love it."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Canada,Moisturizing,"I bought this toner as part of my attempt to repair my skin barrier (I suffered from painful breakouts every other day or so for a year). In my first month of use, I noticed two changes: my moisturizer absorbed + adhered to my face much better and subsequently, I only experienced 3 acne pimples in a month. Previously, every time I would rinse my face even lightly, my Cerave moisturizer would disappear and my skin would feel taut. With the application of this product, I found that my moisturizer works better and my skin doesn’t sting anymore, so I’m definitely happy."
FIRST AID BEAUTY-Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner,Malaysia,love it,at first try.. i dont like it. but after multiple times. I really love it. I use multiple layer on my skin. doesn't feel heavy at all. I also apply on my lips. feel so plump
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,amazing!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Cleared my skin. I had wind burn skin. Tiny little pimples from allergy. It was itchy and oozing. I have sensitive skin. This helped me so much. Love it!
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,USA,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,I am trying to find a more natural skincare line as I find Korean brands to use alcohol. Product seems good but can’t get over the scent as it is overwhelming.
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,USA,Worth of the $$,"I love this toner. When my skin looks dull, this makes so much difference yet very gentle. Next morning, my skin feels soft."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,New Zealand,Like it.,"I like this lotion. It is moisturising and texture is not that watery and can be absorbed quite fast. I have already used up two bottles and this is the third one, recommend for dry skin. It could be better if the scent is lighter."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,USA,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,This is not really a toner- it’s more of a watery lotion. The fragrance is pretty overwhelming. I started using it on my body just to finish it faster. For the price point I don’t think I’d buy it again.
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,USA,a must buy toner.,"Love this toner. I have the whole Abeille line. The toner is very moisturizing - a great first step that helps the watery oil and the serum go on w better coverage. Can’t not mention the Abielle day face cream- so creamy, feels great."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Singapore,moisturizing and not irritating ,I love this toner for it’s texture. It’s a little bit thicker than normal toner yet it’s absorbed fast. Skin feels moisturized instantly but not too much. Not a big fan of the smell but it doesn’t bother me too much as well. Overall a great toner.
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,totally worth the price,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Completely Worth it. I received this as a sample months ago ( may have been last year sometime ) and I’m still using it , it lasts a long time .
It makes my skin clear and healthy and glowing . I’m 39 and it has made my “issues “ so much better , I’m amazed ."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Singapore,❤❤❤,My skin loves this! My skin glows. Never  ever dehydrated again. Its one of the more affordable items in the range thankfully. Will very very likely repurchase. 
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,USA,"Overwhelming fragrance, stings my skin","This stuff is honestly terrible. I have NEVER written a review so fast after trying a product, and usually I try to give a product a fair shake before reviewing. I have only tried this once, and this time, once is enough. The SMELL is overwhelming, like perfume, so much so that all the fragrance stings my periorbital area and turned it bright red. I expected so much more for $75. I have sensitive and reactive skin, so this is horrible. I had read the reviews mentioning the fragrance, but honestly I had no idea it would be THAT BAD. IT IS THAT BAD. If you have sensitive skin, STEER CLEAR."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Singapore,sticky toner not very impressed,Don't really like the feeling after applying as it feels sticky. Bottle is made of cheap plastic packaging. Would much prefer if it's in a glass. Doesn't feel like a luxury skincare product at all. 
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"Based off. sample I received love the concept of this product, but there is so much perfume in it that’s all I can smell. The consistency is watery but leaves a light supple finish. But for the price I expect more than just masking fragrance and questionable formula."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Very moisturizing!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Received in an influenster box. This felt like heaven on my dry cheeks in the winter months. Light scent. Bottle feels luxurious!
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Abeille Royal Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) A free package from Influenster and Guerlain. They are featuring some guerlainessentials and I was excited to give it a try! They sent over their new Abeille Royal Fortifying Lotion, the L'essentiel Natural Glow Foundation, and an Aqua 
Allegoria fragrance and I completely enjoyed it!

I have been using these products for exactly a three month and now I am ready o say something about it. Is it possible to find out anything about products in a a few days or a week. That's why I took this time to test and  see the results, so I could be honest with you.

Packaging : Great!  You feel like a queen when you see these golden bottles with a bee on top.

 Abeille Royal Fortifying Lotion: Guerlain released it in honor of the company's 10th anniversary and I have to say it's absolute love .  It contains 25 times more royal jelly than in the previous version, and my skin felt it!

 By the way, did you know that only the queen bee drinks this milk?  The rest of the bees live much shorter lives, and I wonder why?  Is the secret hidden in this miracle milk?)

 The aroma of the lotion: gentle and pleasant, it is not too strong, but rich.  Moisturizes the skin quite well and has no sticky effect.  Usually I apply it after removing makeup, and in the morning when I wash my face it feels like the skin has completely absorbed it and I have pleasant feelings."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,It’s ok. Just not for me,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It’s great if you have dry skin. Not drying at all but for my oily skin it was too much moisture. Especially after I applied my moisturizer. However it smells great. Besides that, nothing much to write about."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Great Toner,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I got this toner to try out and I was surprised at how luxurious it felt on my skin. It was nice and light and didn’t irritate my sensitive skin. After using  for a bit I noticed my skin looked more glowy and my skin felt more smooth. It did have a scent that I wasn’t overly fond of though so could be something that you don’t like.

I wouldn’t purchase as it’s out of my price range."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Amazing on my skin,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product really gives my skin the extra pump it needs, it creates a natural glow, well holding in all my skins natural moisture. The smell is amazing, doesn’t feel too harsh, only need a little product to cover your face. I love this product"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Nice texture,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I got this free to try for my opinion on influenster. It felt nice on my skin, I don’t know if I would purchase but my skin felt soft after applying"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I recieved this product for free in exchange for my opinion, it took me a while to figure out what do with this but once i did it worked pretty nicely, it smells nice, really light. The packaging was nice, not sure i can justify the price point but this brand is more on the premium side, not really for me but seems like a good product"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It took me a min to figure out the best way to use this as I was not used to the liquid lotion. I am new to toners as well. Once I got it down I really enjoyed using this product. I have dry skin and felt like it left my skin feeling soft and hydrated but not oily. I am looking forward to using this product more especially now that I have some more knowledge.
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Love it!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love this! I have combination oily/dry skin and this has definitely helped in the mornings, I’ve add it to my daily skincare routine. It’s light on my skin and so easy to use, I’m beginning to see a difference already. A little bit goes a long way!"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Very luxurious!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really enjoyed using this toner. It was a very luxurious addition to my daily skincare routine.  It boosted the effects of my usual moisturizer and it felt very soothing on my skin. You only needed a few drops so the size of the bottle is very cost-effective for a luxury product.  If I had the money to spend, I would definitely use this product again."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Toner Extraordinaire,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This new toner released by Guerlain is quite exquisite and exceptional.  The fact that it comes in a recyclable bottle and contains sustainably sourced bee products reinforces my commitment to a company that is environmentally responsible and conscious.  I used this toner everyday morning and night for a month and the results were pretty noticeable.  While it does contain an exclusive royal jelly the toner is more a liquid consistency then jelly like.  It quickly absorbs into the skin and again like the foundation has a distinct smell.  A little goes a long way. After a month of usage my face felt more hydrated, soft and supple. Though my fines lines were unchanged, my uneven skin tones and sun damaged spots were faded. Overall my skin felt re-energized and a glowing brilliance!"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This toner is amazing! I love that whenever I use it my face it's doesn't feel tight and dry after, it leaves my face very hydrated before moisturizing."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Very hydrating,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this for free in exchange for my opinion. I’ve been using this essence feel like lotion for about 6 weeks & it’s very hydrating. It is supposed to be used on clean face before moisturizing. It has a flowery smell but surprisingly it did not irritate my skin at all and a few drops really go a long way. I would definitely suggest it.
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The first time I used the product, I like how it was very light feel on my skin and it really does brighten my skin tone. I used to apply in the morning and at night but I think it made my skin a little oily. I have a combination skin so I decided to apply it during the night. Would definitely recommend to my friends!"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Watery consistency with a nice slip,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This toner has a very interesting consistency - it's light like water but with a slight slip that leaves your skin feeling smooth and moisturized. This would be a good option for those with dry or dehydrated skin who want a toner that does more than clean. I am looking forward to using this in winter when my skin gets quite tight. There is quite a strong scent to this product when you first use it but it fades in a few minutes, so may be helpful to try a few test areas if you're sensitive to fragrance or are prone to breakouts due to fragrance."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a really great toner. It feels so nice on the skin. The bottle is a great size and it will definitely last a while. My only concern is the scent. It is fine for me,  but may be a bit too much for someone with more sensitive skin."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Wanted to love it,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I felt like my skin was glowing from using this toner but it didn’t agree with the chemistry of my skin. I broke out from using this but I can see how this toner could be amazing
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Amazing toner!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I absolutely love this toner! I use it after I cleanse my face and it completely cleans my face leaving it smooth and fresh! The smell is amazing although it is a bit strong. It’s a pretty big bottle so it will last a long time!
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product free from Influenster and really like it. I was unsure how and when to use it, but will use after my cleansing routine. You don't need much so the bottle will last. Nice product, it is scented but smells good."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This lotion is super lightweight; it goes on like water but leaves skin with a lasting moisturized feeling—a little bit goes a long way. It is lightly scented, which I don’t mind at all it because it is a light, fresh scent. Overall, I am very impressed with Guerlain products, as a first time user."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Amazing!! Felt light on the skin! Left my skin feeling soft! The smell is not over powering but just right! The consistency was a little different but it works well and easily could get over it! Highly recommend!!!
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Love this luscious toner!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Love this luscious, lux toner! The lightweight yet thirst quenching toner has me feeling like I've fallen into a one step skincare routine! ( but i obviously don't stop there ) I throughly enjoy how plump my skin looks and feels after using this. So good!"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The bottle is beautiful, however the consistency of the lotion was very different from what I had expected. It was much more liquify than jelly texture. The scent was great and very subtle. Overall, works well and would recommend."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Loving it so far,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love this product! It feels luxurious and light. For a product containing honey, it is quite light. I wear this in my nightime routine and makes my skin feel plump and glowy."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Toner,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The smell is not too strong which is good for a toner. It isn’t too oily and adds a nice shine to my skin. I am a little hesitant to put it on my face with my skin.
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) When my skin is dry, it gets very dry and so I often layer my lotion toners or essence toners before applying my serum or face mask. I found this to layer well because it’s quite thin and without even layers, it gave my skin a bouncy refreshed look. The scent was also quite pleasant which I found surprising Cos I usually don’t like it when my skincare is scented. This isn’t a holy grail for me and now that we’ve moved into the colder months, I will be switching to something a bit thicker. I think If you had normal or oily skin, you’d like this."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Smells really great! The consistency for a lotion threw me  off a bit though. Does feel nice going on as well.
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Light and subtle,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The toner was very lovely and it did go on with a good texture and softness. I liked the smell and the subtly of it. The only issue I found is that it caused a bit of milia under my eyes as I have fairly sensitive. Otherwise I did think it was lovely.
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,I love the scent on my face,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have tried many different toners from a lot of popular cosmetic lines so I was very curious as to why this product is worth purchasing since it is a good $20-$25 more than what I usually would pay for. Of course, after getting this product to test for free, I didn't see any harm in giving it a real try. The scent is very calming and I look forward to putting it on daily. This product is surprisingly not sticky but rather cool and refreshing. I think I will splurge on this product once in a while. Treat myself."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I’m super impressed with this lotion toner!! The first thing I noticed was the scent, I found it overpowering at first but now I really like it! It smells refreshing. The formula itself is very moisturizing and doesn’t leave your skin greasy. 

After using this I noticed a difference in my skin, it was softer and my lines were less noticeable. I was so happy to receive this product because it is not something I would purchase on my own but I would definitely repurchase it now!"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Amazing Product!!!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) So rich and smooth lotion toner! The quality truly is reflecting in the product. Very little weight not greasy at all. Beautiful light scent, truly would recommend!"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Great Smell,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This Toner has a beautiful smell, it goes on nice and leaves my skin super soft, I didn’t find it tackey or sticky. My skin feels great! This product was a sample from Influenster"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is a beautiful toner! It’s very refreshing and soothing. Lightweight feel on the skin. Has a very light fragrance as well. I love anything with Royal jelly so I have high hopes for this one over a time!
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Fresh!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) So light and fresh. Non greasy. Super light scent. Love it!!
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) it’s a beautiful pale, yellow colour. To the touch it is light, non-greasy and very smooth with a light floral scent. It is super easy to apply, just shake a few drops into clean hands and gently pat on cleansed skin. The description offered on the website suggests that this product can be used in addition to your regular skincare routine, preferably before adding your moisturizer.
The claims of the Guerlain Paris Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion are to provide anti-aging and balancing effects to your skin’s complexion, as well as actively working to reduce any signs of stress or pollution.
After immediate application there’s no stinging, redness or irritation that occurs, and after my two weeks of use I don’t notice any irritation occurring from prolonged use either."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,So soothing.,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product is so soothing. Pop it in the fridge and apply at night. I can definitely feel hydration so far. I want to continue to use the product to get the full effect of what else it can do.
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Love! Such a amazing product. I use right after my toner and it has made such a huge difference in my skin. Thanks for the free sample Influenster!
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have been using Guerlain's Royale Anti-Aging Fortifying Lotion Toner for a bit now and I'm quite pleased with it. The lotion is a very thin fluid that isn't greasy feeling at all. It feels light on your skin and is easily applied with a cotton pad. You don't need to use much, as a little goes a long way. I'm am extremely pleased to say that there is hardly any scent to this lotion and it isn't perfumey at all (and this is coming from someone that's very sensitive to fragrance!) 
After using this product I definitely noticed that my skin looks so much better. It glows, and looks noticeably smoother and more radiant. 
The only one thing I should note is that this lotion isn't as fast absorbing as it's claimed to be. I find it takes about an hour to totally absorb totally into my face.
Overall, I really like this lotion and would recommend it to anyone."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Decent toner,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I absolutely love Guerlain’s packaging and this toner bottle didn’t disappoint. It’s so classy, elegant and ready for display! The toner itself has a light almost baby powder scent which I actually enjoy the scent however, I prefer to use un scented products on my face. The product goes on easily and a little goes a long way. I did find that I felt a little bit of a residue on my face afterwards though and I’m not sure  I see any dramatic results. I will continue using it though because it is a decent toner."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Fresh Scent,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I’ve switched my daily moisturizer for this one, and I’m really enjoying it. I love the packaging and the bottle is easy to use. You don’t need a lot to go a long way!
It does have a scent that is not too strong, and it’s so light on my skin. I always apply in the morning after washing my face, really helps with the winter weather."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Nice dewy finish,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product for free as part of an Influenster Voxbox and was very pleased with it. The size is very generous for a lotion as a little goes a long way. The scent is nice and light and the product is not too heavy and leaves skin feeling tightened and lifted with a nice dewy glow. I do however have very oily and sensitive skin so I was surprised I could use this at all but I can use this several days a week without issue but I find for me it is slightly too heavy for daily use. It's nice to have as an option as it leaves skin looking great, I think it would be great for most people unless very oily and super sensitive like myself."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,so-so,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really enjoy the texture of this product, being on the thicker side for a toner but not too thick. It absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth. I honestly haven’t been using it consistently enough to notice if there’s been any change in fine lines or pigmentation. This product is very heavily scented, so probably not great for someone who’s sensitive to fragrance. However, I don’t find that the scent lingers throughout the day. Unsure if I would repurchase due to the heavy fragrance and price point, but will see if it’s worth it once reaching the end of the bottle :)"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Refreshing glow,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I want to start by saying I love the packaging, the product comes out easily but not too quickly or out of control. I am always hesitant to put a product that smells that good on my face. But I was pleasantly surprised how much I like it. The price point is not something I like, a bit expensive, but you do only need a couple drops so the bottle tends to last... just depends on you I guess. I enjoyed using the anti aging aspect as a bonus, but I noticed my skin felt like it had an extra glow to it. Although I did notice an increase in acne while using this Over the last few weeks unfortunately! I used the product only in the morning because of the increase, and another product I use in the evening on my skin cannot have anything else on. Overall I would recommend it, at the price point I’d pass on purchasing again."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,FRESH,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This toner has a very light, clean smelling scent. It leaves your face feeling fresh and hydrated. I enjoyed applying it before my makeup and found it gave my face an overall nicer skin tone. I’m not sure that I would be able to afford this (new mom on a budget) because it does come with a pretty big price tag, but if it ends up being a holy grail I might just do that!!"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Great product,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This toner smells amazing! It’s a bit pricey but I think it’s well worth it! It really made my skin very smooth and I felt like my makeup went on so much easier
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Great product,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I loved this product and it worked great for me. I applied it before the foundation and it turned out amazing. I didn't mind the scent much as it did not affect me but it would not go with everybody. The bottle is very appealing too.
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I think this is a great product that leaves your skin feeling extremely hydrated. I find it smells amazing, but it wouldn't be a good fit for someone sensitive to scents. The price point is a bit high so I don't know that I would pay full price for this, but I would definitely consider getting it if I saw it on sale."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Good product for people with dryer skin,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I am not one for using to many steps to cleansing, i will admit to even using toner the way i may exfoliate or deep clean my skin as too many steps can often dry out and irritate my skin. This product i was able to use slightly more often, it was quite enjoyable as i often feel tight and dry after using a toner but this one left my skin feeling moisturized and the after glow definitely was an added bonus!"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Smooths skin to create a great canvas,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love everything about this toner! The bottle design is elegant, and the smell is light but not overwhelming. It feels beautiful on my skin and has helped to smooth my skin out especially when I apply foundation on top of it. 

This toner is different than others I've used where it doesn't come with a spray top. I usually put a few drops on my hands and massage into my skin."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,I feel so boujee,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) if you don't mind fragrance in your skincare , this lotion toner has a very pleasant luxe scent . The texture is lightweight and absorbs in fast , my skin feels nourished , rested and pampered when I use it . It's a bit sticky tho . This lotion helps with fine lines , wrinkles , skin texture and loss of elasticity . It prepares skin for the rest of your daily routine and helps resist pollution and various stressors ."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Like being at the spa!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Love the smell of this.  Ibstantly feels like I'm at the spa, so luxurious! Does what a toner does. Is it worth the price point? That's up to you.  I can't afford splurges like this so I wouldn't repurchase, but I'm gonna use ever drop in this bottle and enjoy every minute!"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Youthful glow,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product to try as a complimentary sample. I was unsure of how to use the product at first so I ended up using it before my moisturizer. I have noticed that my skin is more radiant and has a healthy glow to it. I do have a beauty spot on my cheek that has lightened and is smoothing out on my face. Works well for aging and mature skin, it helps to give a youthful glow. Would definitely recommend to add to beauty routine."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really like this product! Even after a good cleanse, this toner still gets off any remaining oil and dirt on your skin without drying it out. It is quite heavily scented, but other than that it’s a really great product. You only need to use a little bit so the product will last long."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Great for dry skin,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I loved this product! Great for dry and sensitive skin as it’s really gentle. I often avoid using soapy cleansers in the morning and prefer going for toner. This product gives me enough freshness without messing my levels of pH. It smells really nice and leaves your skin absolutely radiant
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This has completely done wonders for my skin. It smells so pleasant and leaves a lovely dewy feeling on me. Would definitely purchase again!
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Royale jelly in a product and all of it's fabulous benefits what's not to love!  The texture was a little weird for me at first. However, it's lightweight, absorbs quickly, and the delicious scent wow. My skin felt luxurious after every application."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,My new favourite,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I'm almost 40 so my skin started having some issues and it's hard to find product that would take care of all of them so my bathroom is full of lotios, creams, toners..

GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Very luxurious!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Feels very luxurious on the skin! I've been applying just with my finger tips. There is a very slight tackiness that disappears within a few minutes of applying. Definitely very lightweight and not oily feeling at all. And it has a light perfume scent- I don't mind, it's not overpowering. Skin feels more supple, and I like that it's made with 98% naturally-derived ingredients! Haven't seen a huge difference in the look of my skin, but it's more of a protective product against stress/pollution, so I wouldn't expect to see immediate results. I don't have a lot of visible signs on aging yet, so can't speak to that as much. Also applies nicely under makeup, especially with their L'Essentiel Natural Glow Foundation!"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Great toner,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I enjoyed using this toner, it left my skin feeling smooth and soft. It has a nice soft scent, easy to apply and absorbs fast. My skin has a slight glow and appears less dry after a few weeks of using it. I love using skin care with honey as an ingredient. The only drawback about this product is the high price but that's often with French skincare brands."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Great product,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Very luxurious product. Made my skin feel very hydrated and soft. Not sure if it made it any firmer since I would say that my skin is pretty firm as it is. This is definitely not a necessity but excellent product.
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Great product with a nice scent.,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Loved the way my skin felt after each application.
Application is pretty easy, pour a little on your palm and massage into your skin. 
Although I’ve been using a cotton pad lately.
But above all it’s a great product with a nice scent, and I would recommend.
I don’t have any serious skin care concerns, but it was able to minimize my pores to the barest minimum"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,USA,Didn’t work for me,I used every morning for the past 2 months and see no difference in my skin.
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,So So,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I didn’t find it did much for me, It was a little too oily and it was difficult to use. Although I did like the scent when using it."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Very Scented,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I couldn’t get over how scented this toner was. I’m sure prolonged use would make my skin feel nice, but I couldn’t stop sneezing!"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I like this product. It feels luxurious to own and apply. It is moisturizing and I’ve notice it gives me a nice, healthy glow. But I do have textured and acne prone skin so this lotion doesn’t help in that department, which I am aware of. Nonetheless, it is a lovely product and I do like using it."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Love,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I loveeeee this product. Definitely have noticed a changed in my skin. My face looks more alive and refreshed

GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This toner supervised me! It is lightweight and surprisingly moisturizing for a toner! It has a very light scent but it’s one that I love so much and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin! 
I find best to use with my nighttime routine!"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I added this product to my routine recently. It works best with my bedtime routine as I found it didn’t work well with my makeup. Smells nice and didn’t cause any breakouts. It makes my skin seem softer and seems to have helped fine lines
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) A lightweight toner that hydrates your skin and leaves your skin feeling plump and smooth. It has a strong but luxurious scent, so this may not be for those who are sensitive to fragrance. Although it’s on the pricier side of toners, you only need a few drops per use so one bottle can last you for quite a while. 

Overall, it’s a nice luxurious toner worth trying, especially as it gets colder, this toner would be great for a boost of hydration and healthy glow!"
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Amazing product,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received through influenster a complementary sample of Guerlain Abeille Royale Anti-aging Fortifying Lotion Toner.

I have used this toner for a month in my morning and evening routines, my conclusions are as follows:
- The presentation of the product is beautiful, as most of the Products that Guerlain produces.
- It is a very soft lotion that recommends two application options, one is using a cotton and the second, applying with the hands.
I used them both ways and definitely the one that worked best for me was the second one.
- It  only needs a few drops and apply by pressing gently against the face skin, the rest I applied on my hands.
- This tonic, from the first application, leaves a sensation of freshness, hydration and softness in the skin very evident, the skin feels smooth, soft, the pores are diminished (I have combined skin and open pores, especially in summer).
- From the the first applications it shows the anti-aging properties and, as the days go by, the skin feels firmer.
- I would change the dosage perhaps to an atomizer so that the application is easier.
- I liked the scent, is very soft but is not the type of scents that I like for my personal use.
- The product costs approximately 90CAD and I think the price vs. the amount used per day and the benefits are totally worth it.
After exactly one month of use, I have not used more than the 25% of the toner.

For me it is a 100% recommended product and is now included in my beauty routines."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,Beautiful Texture,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I love this product! The texture is smooth and weightless. It feels very hydrating and absorbs into the skin quickly without leaving any residue. It does have a fairly perfume-y scent, which doesn't bother me at all - but if you're sensitive to scented products, skip this one."
GUERLAIN-Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,Canada,GUERLAIN Abeille Royale Fortifying Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Very nice toner, it feels super fresh on the skin, it dries pretty fast. It doesn’t have a strong smell, so if your sensitive to strong scents this product will work fine. After using it I feel my skin really smooth."

BY TERRY-Baume De Rose Beauty Toner,Singapore,smells good,Love this toner especially it smells like tea rose. Smells so good and relaxing. The toner moisturizes my skin well and doesnt makes me break out. Will repurchase once I finish the current one.
CLE DE PEAU-Essential Refining Essence,Singapore,ms b,This is my 3 rd bottle and would love to continue using it for my combi oily skin. It does work great in singapore weather : hot humid. It ran out of stock so fast i had to grab it as soon i see it available.
CLE DE PEAU-Essential Refining Essence,Canada,PASS,"Thought I’d give this a try cuz it’s a better value than the tatcha essence however after trying this one I was very disappointed. As soon as I took off the cap I could smell the alcohol and sure enough it’s the second ingredient which shocked me. Alcohol is very harsh and drying on your skin, not sure why it’s in an essence that’s supposed to hydrate and enhance your skin care!? Returned right away. Stick to the tatcha, it’s more expensive but incredible."

LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Love this more than the original,"Great alternative to the original. I love that this version is lightweight but still hydrating. I used it at the end of my PM routine and it absorbed so nicely! Plus, the scent isn’t as strong, which I prefer. It left my skin looking smooth and moisturized in the morning."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,A soft and silky moisturizer,"This moisturizer from La Mer is truly luxurious. A little goes a long way with how rich and creamy the texture is.

LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,"This moisturizer is soft and absorbed nicely into my skin - no greasy residue or pilling. It smells great too, that classic lotion smell. It’s pricey but you get what you pay for, and a little goes a long way!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,"Not worth the money, better options out there!","I received two small samples of this to test out. I had always been curious about the brand and when I saw it pop up as an option to try it I was very excited. However I was quickly disappointed. The lotion felt a bit heavy despite being advertised as good for combo skin. It also has a heavy scent. For the price, I would expect this to make my skin feel and look noticeably different but I didn’t see any results."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Obsessed!,"I love this product, it’s incredibly hydrating on the skin and it lasted all throughout the day and during the night after applied onto the skin. A little bit goes a long way, I just wish this product was cheaper!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,Canada,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,"The La Mer moisturizing soft lotion is very light weight and hydrating and left my skin soft and smoothe.

LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,Love how luxurious this product is and how nice it feels on my skin! Not too heavy but not too lightweight. I received this product for free so I was happy to try but no I would not splurge this much on a moisturizer personally.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Not impressed for the price,"This lotion feels very luxurious in texture and has a lovely scent that isn’t overpowering. It absorbs into the skin beautifully but does leave a dewy shine to the skin after application. I found that for my combination skin, it didn’t provide enough hydration to last me through the entire day. This might be better for skin types who lean more oily. I also personally could never justify spending this much money on a moisturizer when there are so many cheaper alternatives."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,This La mer moisturizer is very hydrating and not to thick or thin. My only problem is that it is highly fragranced. I am usually not affected by scented products but this one is a bit overpowering for me.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Someday I will invest!,Wow..a little really does go away! I hate to say it but it is sooo good. I wish it were more affordable T.T The texture is so thick and my skin felt so supple after using it. It has a nice subtle smell to it so overall I really like it!

LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Soft and Smooth Skin,This lotion is perfect for my oily skin.  A little of this product goes a long way and helps moisturize my skin without leaving a greasy film.

LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,In love,Very smooth and makes me glowy. It is very hydrating and very light in texture. I love that the little goes a long way. Literally in love with the products and will be definitely buying it again in the future.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Nice but expensive,There is no argument La Mer products have the luxurious feel! The moisturizing lotion smells like a spa and is lightweight but hydrating. I don’t like to use fragranced products on my face due to sensitive skin so I prefer this one as a hand cream and I think there are similar but more affordable products on the market.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,The best,This moisturizer is so creamy and thick. It makes my skin hydrated and moisturized. I love the mild smell of it and the sleek packaging. I definitely recommend this product if you’re looking for something moisturizing
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,It’s okay,"Honestly the lotion is fine but I’m not so impressed by the price and what the actual lotion does! La Mer products are amazing but they kind of missed with this one, nothing special about it unfortunately."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,A must have for combo skin,This is by far one of the best lotions I have used. The soft delicate texture is so soothing to the skin and a little goes a long way. This is easy to wear underneath makeup and on its own. It doesn’t feel overly greasy or uncomfortable on the skin.

I love La Mer, I just wish it wasn’t so expensive!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Great,"This cream is amazing! I had super dry legs and arms and this cream brought back the hydration in FULL! The best part you only need a little bit to get the job dont. Its rich, but not heavy and really works into your skin well. Definitely going to be keeping these in my bag."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,"Hands down the best moisturizer I have ever used! So silky smooth and hydrating. You only need a pea size amount and a little goes a long way. My skin is typically very dry and irritated by the end of the day and this moisturizer helps relieve my skin. It does have a small scent to it, but didn’t seem overwhelming.

This item is a splurge but will last you a while!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,I was a little disappointed with this product. I use the moisturizing soft cream religiously and was hoping this product would be similar but unfortunately this one missed the mark. I wasn’t hydrating like the moisturizing soft cream at all and the smell was very weird—nothing like the signature La Mer scent I’m used to. I’ll stick with my soft cream.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Absorbs into my skin quickly,This is soooo creamy and smooth!  I love how it glides right on and I can feel it absorb almost right away.

I look forward to using it every day."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Love this !,I received this lotion as a gift from Lamer. Here are my thoughts: I love all of Lamer products and as you know they all have a unique fragrance to them. This lotion also has an enticing fragrance which is amazing. This makes my skin feel softer and smoother instantly. I use it everyday.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Amazing!,"This product is really great. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and extremely soft after just one use. It’s the perfect skincare product to add to your winter routine, especially when you live in NYC."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Very Thick and Luxurious,"I have combination skin that has both dry and oily areas on different parts of my face. I focused this product onto the drier areas of my skin to put it to the test! A little goes a long way with this thick moisturizing lotion—which I love! This is definitely a product that you will buy once and have for a while. It has a very high quality and luxurious texture that transports you to a high end spa for the ultimate form of self care! Overall, it moisturized my skin very well and locked in moisture. I prefer to use this product as part of my PM skincare routine because for my skin type, it is a bit on the heavier side."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,Been loving this lotion! It’s super hydrating & blends like a dream. I’ve been using it under makeup & it’s so beautiful! I love the finish & it makes my skin looks so healthy & glowy! Highly recommend !!

LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,A Luxury Indeed,"Though it's definitely an investment buy, taking care of my skin is top priority so this product is well worth it! It's been over a week and I'm already seeing a difference in the hydration in my skin. The scent is what you would expect from a high-end product, it's spa-like but not offensive. Will definitely continue to use and purchase the full product."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,obsessed,A little goes a long way with this product - it's the height of luxury skincare for sure. The scent is AMAZING! I place on skin where my skin is dry and it works wonders. I'm going to purchase the full size.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Feels nice but pricey,"This moisturizer is very luxurious. It has a nice lightweight  texture, its very hydrating, and goes on well . It makes my face feel soft and moisturized. I can’t say if its worth the crazy price though, as you can get similar results with another good moisturizer. Overall, a little goes a long way and it does keep your skin soft and hydrated so if you can afford it, this would be a good choice as a winter moisturizer!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,This moisturizing cream is amazing!!!! It’s so soft and so creamy. A little goes a long way which I love that about this product. It helps keeps my skin nice and hydrated for hours. This lotion is amazing.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,I have heard so much about la mer because all of the celebrities use it and I was finally able to try it. It made my skin so smooth and hydrated. I like that it feels very light and not greasy on the skin but still makes my skin feel nice and hydrated. Definitely a pricey lotion though
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,"i received a small sample for free and this was my first time trying la mer. considering the price point i wasn’t too impressed with the product itself.. i feel like the the type of results
i received it wasn’t worth splurging"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,"This really moisturizes your skin! My skin was feeling cracked and dry. Once I used this, it felt refreshed and hydrated. Easily to apply and does not irritate my skin. Bit on pricey side but I recommend to try if you are able to!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,the perfect lightweight moisturizer,"The moisturizing soft lotion is the perfect lightweight moisturizer. I typically wear the cool gel, but this is perfect for my skin in the winter. This is a favorite that I’ve repurchased many time. Love La Mer!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,"I’m a big fan of the original Creme de la Mer and the soft moisturizer- they’d been my go-to for couple of years in winter while I lived in NYC. I bought this lotion for warmer weather, but it’s heavy & oily for summer days and dry for fall. I can get better summer moisturizer at a much lower price.
Also, La Mer doesn’t have container recycle program which is super annoying to me."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Very moisturizing but CONTAINS ALCOHOL DENAT.!,"I thought that this was (just) slightly more moisturizing than the moisturizing soft cream. But it DOES CONTAIN ALCOHOL DENAT. whereas the soft cream does not. It didn’t irritate my dry sensitive skin, but it irritated my eczema areas and extremely dry patches. And boy - it wasn’t fun when it got close to my eyes (whoops!) - while the soft cream was forgiving. I appreciate the pump bottle design a lot more than the jar. I don’t use a lot either, despite how dry my skin is. Overall, this is a good daily lotion!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Miracle moisturizer!,"My skin drastically improved since adding this to my morning routine. I use a very heavy moisturizer and serums in the evenings so I like that this is on the lighter side. It makes my skin nice and glowy - it sits great under makeup but I’ve found myself being able to skip foundation all together since using this.  I also have slightly acne prone skin and the few other La Mer products I’ve tried have broke me out, but not this one! My skin is clearer than I’ve seen it in years."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,Canada,Great daily moisturizer.,"So I have combination skin and rosacea and this moisturizer has done wonders for my skin. I use it both day and night, just one pump for my face (and eyes) and another pump for my neck. 

I have not broken out, and my skin adores this moisturizer.  It is lighter than the creme de la mer, which my skin was not so crazy about. But also heavy enough to keep skin from drying out during the cooler months. 

Also, I've had a single bottle for over three months now. It is highly cost-effective in that sense. Well worth the money."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,la Mer Magic,"I love the original cream, but it is to thick for me to use as a daytime moisturizer. I picked up the moisturizing soft lotion as it is much more lightweight and has all the same benefits as the original cream. I have to say I am in love with this moisturizer! The packaging is very luxurious and comes in a pump which I love, what I love most is the actual cream itself. It’s extremely lightweight, it absorbs relatively quickly and leaves my skin with a soft focus like finish. The scent is beautiful and not overbearing, and it doesn’t make any of my other skincare perform any different. My serums and eye creams all perform amazing with it(granted they are La Mer Products as well haha). If you are looking for a light moisturizer with great skin benefits then give this a try!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,Love it. Perfect consistency for combination skin. Expensive but lasts me for 6-8 months.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Keeps my skin soft and clear,"This is the best moisturizer I have used in a long time. I have combination, sensitive and also acne prone skin and many products (especially moisturizers and foundations) break me out. At the beginning I tried La Mer Original Moisturizer, then Soft Creme and they both broke me out. Then I tried Soft Lotion and to my surprise my skin actually improved, all acne disappeared and my skin felt so smooth, soft and clear! I couldn’t believe the difference. I know this is expensive moisturizer but I would pay anything just keep my skin beautiful and clear. I wish I tried this moisturizer earlier - I was lucky I got three samples of it from Bloomingdales (unfortunately they don’t give you La Mer samples at Sephora), used for over a month and now I’m going to buy full size from Sephora."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Great for Irritated Skin,"Honestly, when I got this lotion, I used it and went “meh,” set it aside and forgot about it. As far as lotions go, it wasn’t bad but it wasn’t great either. One day, after being out in the sun sans sunscreen I came home to really dry, irritated, peeling skin. I tried several different lotions to no avail and then suddenly remembered the La Mer. Surprisingly, this lotion really calmed everything down overnight. So... if you happen to have particularly sensitive skin or if you’re unlucky enough to have an allergy aloe (and you have extra money to burn) this lotion might be up your alley."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,"If you have acne prone, sensitive, or even sort of normal skin this will break you out!!! Not just a little breakout, it will give you terrible acne. I broke out from it and couldn't find out what was wrong. My mom broke out from it and so did 2 of my friends. no no no!"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,Amazing. Love this stuff
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Another La Mer Winner,"I read that many girls found this lotion to be greasy and clogs pores.  I still wanted to try it because all I use is La Mer products and found the crème to be too heavy for day time.  So I tried this lotion as soon as I got it and loved it.  The next day I used two pumps, big mistake.  The key to this lotion is to use it very sparingly.  I put it on after my La Mer Treatment lotion while my skin is still damp, that way the lotion gets sucked into my skin immediately.  I love this stuff but you have to experiment with the amount to make it work for you."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Works beautifully under my make up,I have very dry skin and I wear this under my make up it has SPF. This product makes my skin very soft.  My skin looks luminesce.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Just Meh,"I used to use this product when I had combination skin. It's advertised as for oily skinned gals but honestly I probably would not use this if you're truly very oily. It did work quite well for my combination skin at the time, doing a good job of moisturizing without breaking me out, but I did not feel like it really gave me wow results that justify the cost. Other, much less expensive moisturizers will get you similar results."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,"This lotion maybe too greasy for those of oily skin, although it is advertised to be good for them. After putting it onto your face, you hand will be greasy as well."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,Great like most of the La Mer products!
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,La Mer The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,"At first I was not a fan, it felt greasy and had a very strong scent. But I can't deny the amazing results. My skin is softer and smoother. I've come to love it."
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,LOVE!,"La Mer is my favorite skincare line.  It's my HG!  I can't tell you how excited I was that Sephora was finally carrying it.  I've been using the line for 20 years.  When I started using it, there was one place you could buy it & the ladies at the department store would snicker & whisper whenever I was in buying it.  Finally, someone spoke up & asked me what I was doing buying La Mer products, since it was for ""old people"" & I was 24... I told them that:
A. It was Hollywood's best kept secret (living in LA)
B. I wanted to start early, so when I got ""old"" it wouldn't show.. 
Well, fast forward 20 years & EVERY TIME I order a glass of wine or a margarita, I get carded!  I got ID'd this week buying Sudafed.  Where are those ladies now?  I really want to find them. lol!

As far as the La Mer ""The Moisturizing Soft Lotion"" it's my go-to, every morning after I wash my face & use my serum & I put it on.  Never fails.  It's got the scent of the original Creme de la Mer, (natural beachy scent), it's so smooth & hydrating.  It gives me an instant glow!  I remember once that my cleaning lady asked why my face was always so ""glowy"" in the morning.. The soft lotion is the answer.  If you have oily skin, I think this would be really heavy first thing in the morning &/or underneath makeup.  But, dry-normal will benefit.  The cream itself gives your skin a translucent effect.  It's beautiful.  I never break out from it or any other La Mer product.  I would suggest using the Gel version of the Creme de la Mer or the Perfecting Treatment  (not sold yet at Sephora) as a moisturizer in the morning/primer. Those would be my 2 recommendations if you have oily prone skin.  This might be too much to handle.  

I've been layering the Perfecting Treatment over my moisturizers both in the morning (Soft Lotion) & night (Creme de la Mer).  It adds such a nice smooth look under makeup during the day & helps seal up the products & acts as a conductor, allowing everything to sink into the skin more effectively, at night.  

Another use for the Moisturizing Soft Lotion is to use it in place of Creme de la Mer, as your moisturizer at night in the summertime.  To me, it's just a much lighter, creamier version of the original creme.  If using it at night, I think ALL skin types would benefit!

I highly recommend the entire line.  If possible, find those pre-made kits, to try things out for a few weeks to see how your skin will respond & what exactly will work for you before buying full sizes.  They're available at high-end department stores.  But, chances are you'll fall in love.  I haven't had any complaints from anyone I recommended it to, over the years.  

The most important thing I can say is: nothing works overnight.  (although your skin will feel great quickly), you may not see visual differences right away, give it time!  Also, with all of the La Mer products, a little goes a LONG way.. Some of my products last 6 months.  Make sure you speak to a Sales Associate who's been trained with La Mer products.  The application techniques can make all the difference!  

Here's to your best skin ever in 2017!! XOXO"
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,mineral oil,Extremely greasy. Had to wash off after 20 minutes.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,Broke me out,I was in a high end mood for a few months and decided to dive into the La Mer world. I was hesitant due to the price but I still decided to take the plunge. They have a great scent and consistency HOWEVER I broke out within a week of use. I continued to use the product as I thought my skin was purging all the bad bacteria. It never stopped and only got worse. Even after switching off the brand it took awhile to get it all cleared up. I'm not even acne prone so be careful.
LA MER-The Moisturizing Soft Lotion,USA,hydration all day!,"A little goes a long way with the gorgeous product so this will last you and is worth the investment! After rubbing it between my fingers, I press it into my skin and my skin has a dewy glow to it. The hydration stays with me all day!

CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Softening Lotion,I use this as a toner rather than a lotion! It hydrates my skin very well
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Softening Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This has the texture between a serum and an essence. It’s lightweight but left my skin hydrated and soft! The scent isn’t overpowering and fades pretty quickly.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Softening Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I find my skin can be dry and yet my t zone gets oily.   The texture of my skin is a little rough week dry. After using the lotion I found my skin felt smoother and plump. There was less tightness and it definitely felt softer! 

 After using the lotion I followed up with the moisturizing cream where I felt I needed more hydration. The products worked well together and went on nicely. 

The lotion definitely made a positive difference to my skin when paired with the rest of the skincare line. I wasn't too fond of applying it with the cotton as I felt it was hard to judge how much product was actually going on to my skin. I used a silicone applicator that I had and that worked wonderfully!

I have recommended it to friends and will continue to do so!"
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Softening Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have never used a liquid lotion before but I’m pleasantly surprised at how much I like it! I apply it either with a cotton pad or with my hands, and pat it in like an essence. It absorbs and hydrates my skin nicely when paired with the Intensive Fortifying Cream. I wouldn’t say I would use it by itself for me in the winter as I think I need more hydration - but definitely in the summer, it would be great with my oily skin!"
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Softening Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product has the consistency of serum and essence! It’s lightweight but hydrates well. I find it make my skin nice and bright after nightly use. I use the before the moisturizer step. It is lightly fragranced like other product from this brand.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Highly recommend!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I have missed using softening lotions in my routine and am so happy to have had the opportunity to try this one. It leaves my skin feeling soft, hydrated and supple. It has a nice consistency and does not leave any stickiness upon application. It has a beautiful texture and is very reminiscent of Shi Seido products I have previously tried. I find this product to be worth the money and not too pricey compared to other Cle de Peau products that I sampled alongside this one. I will definitely purchase this one once I work through other products that I have."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Nice lotion for dry skin,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) My skin looked dry and dull before the lotion, and after the lotion, my skin became more smooth and hydrated. The lotion feels like an oil toner that reduces the look of pores. It was effective at hydrating and moisturizing my skin because my skin felt more smooth afterward. I would recommend to a friend."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Softening Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Received this product for free in exchange for my opinion. The product itself is great,  feels good on the skin no reactions , subtle smell, leaves skin feeling great,  smooth and clean. Because of that price point though I would not be able to continue using this product."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Softening Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I will recommend to people who has really dry skin and none of toner or lotion works. It really helps with hydration and moisture level. I am acne prone skin and it did not stress my skin at all. Good good. But if you already satisfied with your current toner or lotion, not need to switch. It is pretty high price point"
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Soft with a light floral scent,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This lotion was a dream for dry skin.  The lotion was not greasy and left my skin feeling soft.  There is a very light scent that lingers.

I have very dry skin, so this product was a treat for my skin. It has a very light and watery texture, which my body absorbs so easily. It leaves my skin feeling and looking really hydrated. This product does contain fragrance which could be a concern for some."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Refreshing,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) its consistency is similar to that of a toner or essence. I believe this holds true for other Japanese skincare products. The liquid is watery and aqueous and so it feels very lightweight on the skin. The application is smooth and refreshing.
my skin looked even more luminous and retained moisture better than before. love it"
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Watery lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Received this product as #freesample from #Influenster.
I have never come across a lotion that seems like a micellar water. Anyway, this lotion is hydrating and leaves my skin soft and supple.
Quite expensive though."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,More like an essence,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I like the fact that it hydrates your skin well. It absorbes fast and has a pleasing smell to it. Very soothing. It feels like a essence-like consistency.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Super soft and fast absorbing,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really loved how this lotion made my skin feel. It was so soft and I was surprised on how well it absorbed into my skin. When I first applied it to the cotton pad I was concerned it was going to be a bit oily but that wasn't the case at all. I do think though the price of this product is a bit much for what you get out of it.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Softening Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The lotion works well with the serum and the cream! Love how it feels on the skin. I have very dry skin. After using this it definitely felt more hydrated.

I received a free sample of this cle de peau beaute hydro softening lotion from influenster. Not a big fan of applying lotion this way but it felt soft and Soothing.

CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Softening Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I applied the hydro-softening lotion as recommended with the Clé de Peau Beauté Cotton. The combination of the product and the soft cotton felt nice on my skin. The lotion absorbed quickly into my skin upon application and my skin felt soft the next morning. Out of the few Clé de Peau products I've tried, this one doesn't have as strong a scent."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Loved it,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This was lovely addition to my skincare routine. Smells like.. my mother's skincare line but has a nice consistency. Great for my dry skin
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,I’m in love!!,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) When I first saw this product, I was a little sceptical that it’d work but , god, I was so wrong. Don’t let the consistency deceive you. It does it’s job extremely well. My skin felt so rough earlier; thanks to the dry patches on my face. But it feels super soft and smooth now. I’m amazed and also love the fact that you have to use just a little. I’m in love!!"
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Moisturizing,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Received complimentary. Feels good on skin, makes my skin feel so soft. It absorbs quickly on skin and has a light scent. I would recommend it if price is not an issue."

CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Didn't notice any difference in my pores.,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I like it's light scent. My skin did feel hydrated after using it. I noticed it didn't reduce my pores. I would recommend this if you don't mind the price.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,"Great for dry skin, especially in the winter!","(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This toner/lotion really is softening and hydrating! I wanted to use this product for two weeks before writing a review. It has a nice fragrance but it might be overwhelming for some people who have a sensitive nose. The liquid is a little more viscous than a regular toner and you can feel that it’s more than just water. Once you’ve spread it onto your face, you can feel it absorbing into your skin and leaving your face softer. Unlike some toners that leave your face feeling tight and dry, this is the complete opposite! I don’t feel like I need to rush to put on a serum and will sometimes walk around with just this toner if I’m feeling lazy. I definitely recommend this product for the winter when your skin is drier than usual and needs the extra boost of hydration. With someone who has acne prone skin, however, I don’t really think this line of products help with this issue. So I don’t recommend them if you have acne issues that you are trying to prevent."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Softening Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Before my skin looked rough and dry and after using the lotion I see mynpores less and I look more refreshed and my skin is soft and looks great.

My skin feel noticeably more hydrated afterwards, however I haven’t really noticed much of a different when it comes to my pores."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Felt nice but not a necessity..,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This lotion was just fine. There wasn't much of a difference in the look of my skin after applying the product with a cotton pad, but it did feel nice and it absorbed into my skin quickly. I had enough to use for a month and to be frank, I didn't notice much of a difference in my skin on the days where I deliberately chose to leave this step out just to see how the other products would fare without it. It does feel luxurious, especially with the branded cotton pads so if you have the money to throw at luxury products.. sure give this a try. If you expect bang for your buck - there are more affordable options that perform the same."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Better than the La Mer treatment lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I liked this lotion quite a bit, it’s runny and absorbs well, the smell is pleasant. It didn’t irritate my sensitive skin, and I did notice less texture on my face. May repurchase in the future, #influenster"

CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Glow,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Made my skin smooth and soft.  I had a wonderful glow after use.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Quick absorbing light lotion! Leaves skin soft!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this product for free from @influester and from cle de peau in exchange for my honest review... so this feels exactly the same as shiseido softening lotion. I really couldn't tell the difference and they smell identical. I'm a huge fan of this lotion because it literally applying a sheer liquidity goodness that absorbs really quickly and leaves your skin extra soft. I usually use this in the summer as an alternative to a cream and it does truly leave your skin soft. It has a very light scent and feel super light on the skin. It absorbs really quickly and works great for my.combination skin. Definitely a contender!
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Softening Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I really liked this product! I applied using the cotton pads and that worked really well without feeling like a waste. I found this was great before my moisturizer step, and it felt really light on my skin without drying.

The Hydro-Softening Lotion is a wonderful toner that is very hydrating and doesn't dry out the skin. I like how lightweight it is, and how quickly it is absorbed into the skin. It leaves my skin feeling soft and supple. I have been using the product for a couple if weeks now, and have noticed that my skin looks smoother. I finds that it is the perfect primer for my other skincare products, such as serum and moisturizer cream. The other products layer very nicely over it, without any pilling."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,effective toner to prep the skin,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) It preps my skin to better absorb the serum and skin care that is applied after. The toner has a thin texture making it not heavy on the skin at all. It leaves my skin feeling ready to absorb more nutrients from the serum.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Leaves skin hydrated and revitalized,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The lotion is unscented and has a watery texture similar to toner. Since it has a thinner texture than the serum, I would apply this before using the serum for better absorption. Prior to using this product, my skin looked dull and yellow. After use, my skin felt more bouncy, revitalized and hydrated. I would recommend this product to friends and family."

This is an extra hydration boost that my mature skin needs. Light, absorbed quickly and smelled great! Again this product is out of my beauty budget but we’ll worth it if you can afford it. #influenster"
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Softening Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I used this product with the line’s cotton pads and applies beautifully and makes the skin feeling moisturized. The scent is absolutely luxurious and I felt classy applying it with the thick cotton pads. 

I don’t really have pores and can’t comment on that too much. While it feels amazing on the skin and leaves it soft, I’m not convinced I absolutely need this step in my skin care routine (at least for now). 

I got a small deluxe glass bottle sample of this for free in exchange for an honest review"
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Super hydrating.,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Absolutely loved it! It kept my skin hydrated and didn’t feel heavy or sticky and smelled amazing. Will definitely recommend to everyone.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Softening Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I'm in love with the texture of this lotion, smooth and lubricating. I use it in the step for toner and it hydrates my very dry skin pretty well. Smell is good too. Like those ordinary luxury skin care products"
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Works for me,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This lotion worked for me and has visibly reduced my pores.since I have dry skin it nicely hydrates my skin and doesn’t make it oily or sticky .it’s actually very light and absorbed very well into my skin.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Softening Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I like how the balancing softening lotion makes me feel. It’s an extra hydration boost during wintertime! I am sure about the refining pore part since I only have a sample to use.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Softening Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I didn’t find it did anything. It didn’t really moisturize and I don’t find it did anything to my pores.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,"Softens skin, helps with oil control","(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I absolutely loved this product, it made the greatest difference in my skin texture. 

The product is lightweight, refreshing and hydrating for the skin. Not to mention the scent is quite luxurious, but at the same time it’s very gentle and relaxing to the senses. I use this product after cleansing my face (morning and night) and wipe it all over with a cotton pad. The lotion doesn’t leave my skin sticky at all and absorbs quite fast into the skin. After several uses I’ve noticed my skin is a lot more plump, and softer and definitely helped to control the oil on my skin throughout the day!

Although, it’s described as a lotion, I would say it resembles more of an essence or toner."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Softening Lotion,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This lotion was hydrating to my skin, but once again I don’t know if it’s worth the price.
Also, the scent is subtle compared to their other products."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Cle De Peau Hydro-Softening Lotion,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I liked this quite a bit. I think it’s very overpriced and VERY fragranced which I’m not fond of. But it did make my skin feel very hydrated. I personally think you could find something similar for a fraction of the price.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Softening!,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This product was great for balancing and softening my skin! It  quickly hydrated the skin and left my skin smooth. I used it with the cotton pads that came along with this product in my influester box. You only needed a very little amount to get enough hydration for the skin to feel soft and supple.
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Not for everyone,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received a complimentary product to try. I’ve used cle de peau’s products before and have always been impressed with their products! This hydrating lotion is good, but there are better ones with a more economical price tag. Nothing special, but nice to try if you’re curious!"
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Very moisture,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received these awesome @cledepeaubeaute sample from #influenster for an honest review. The Hydro-Softening Lotion eliminates roughness and dryness while reducing the look of pores for a beautifully balanced complexion.

I personally am not a fan of liquid lotion it wasnt hydrating enough for my dry/sensitive skin.
I love the cleasing foam and serum but not this"
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,If you like light weight creams...,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I received this as a complimentary sample from Influenster to give an honest review.  Either my skin is exceptionally dry, or it wasn't as hydrating as my skin needed because I had to use it twice a day even though it said once. It's a very light weight cream and I think my preference is more of a heaver cream. The scent was lovely. It applied beautiful. So if you enjoy a light cream, this would be a great choice."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,So glad I have this in my life,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Okay, so I recognize the retail price is high but this is such a beautiful concept of a lotion! First of all, it smells heavenly and is so lightweight that it instantly absorbs into your skin. I used this with the cleanser and serum and was shocked by how soft my skin looked after using the products for even a few days. Results lasted for a few weeks. 

I’d love to continue using these heavenly products! It’s great for my skin type and gives me an excellent level of hydration."
CLE DE PEAU-Hydro-Softening Lotion,Canada,Great for Dry Dull Skin,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The combo of hydro softening lotion and the serum is a bomb of hydration for thirsty skin! No smell just straight nice softening lotion. I wish the consistency is thicker. Overall I had good experience. It's on the expensive side but good quality and very nice for luxurious minimalist skin care regimen.

OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Australia,YTTP dupe,I bought this toner as a dupe for Youth to the People exfoliator. It works very nicely and is a good price. I enjoy the scent and it is quite a gentle toner. I will try this again for sure.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Malaysia,Refreshing toner,"This is my second bottle and I like this better than the blue bottle as this one is milder and always makes my skin feel more fresh. It has a mild smell which I like and is super gentle on skin, when I have a breakout I just put this on with my bare hands and it heals very quickly. Love this, thank you so much Ole Henrkisen and Sephora!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Malaysia,ok,"The smell is pleasant but wouldn’t repurchase this again as there’s not much improvements seen for what it claims to tackle, it is also slightly sticky after application however skin feels clean "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,So good,Really keeps my oil build up at bay during the day. Even with a full face of makeup
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Yea,I have oily skin and this toner helps keep oil and blackheads at bay. Also has a fresh smell and leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,New Zealand,Nice Toner.,Pretty good toner for the price. I won't be repurchasing as I'm hooked on a different one that destroys my acne - Tarte Knockout- but this one is a good second to it! and its cheaper!!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,New Zealand,nope,Didnt like this at all got the matching moisturiser aswell because the description sounds amazing but its really harsh and stingy.                                  
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,New Zealand,miss ,Helped in adding to making more pores appear smaller. Not too harsh on the skin and gives a nice clean feel when used. Takes off a good amount of dirt/makeup after cleansing. Worth it and the bottle last quite a while as well.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,New Zealand,Obsessed!!,"I have repurchased this about 6 times now and I just love it!! This is definitely not talked about enough, love the salicylic acid - you can always notice the difference the following day! If you're looking for a sign to buy this; this is it!!!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,New Zealand,Amaizng product,This is my absolute favourite product at the moment! It makes my skin feel so clean and refreshed. Doesn’t feel harsh or burn like some other toners. Definitely one of my best purchases!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,New Zealand,good for oily skin ,"Really good for oily skin, brought this full range for my partner and this really helps with his redness and texture. Definitely recommend for oily skin, not good for dry skin"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Incredible skin transformation,I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING! I have only used this product for a week and IMMEDIATELY saw a change in my skin. I am in my 30s and have adult acne. For the first time in 3 years I don’t have an active breakout and have not gotten any new breakouts since introducing this toner. I could cry.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,It is effective and not irritating for rosacea/sensitive skin. I also use the cleanser and it is a good pair to combat oily skin and dead skin cells. I feel like my skin is fresh and not too dry. I always apply moisturizer afterwards. I have seen a reduction in breakouts and shine.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Australia,excellent,"I get really oily skin in summer, this toner really helps. It doesn’t leave my skin too dry either. I have combination skin and this helps to balance problem areas. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Australia,Feels Refreshing,"It smells and feels so nice on my skin. if you have sensitive skin be aware because it can have a strong tingle. I haven't noticed too much difference in oil control, maybe a tiny bit better?"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"My favorite toner 1000% ❗️it leaves my face minty, hydrated, and also not oily in area that are oily than others. It’s pricey but totally worth it. I use this every morning and night. highly recommend!! I have really dry skin but, when using this everyday; it totally helps in so many ways."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,I really like this product it calms my skin and I definitely don’t fell it as oily as I did before and it has a great smell.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,Did not help my blackheads,"This did nothing for my skin. It was recommended for black heads. The smell is very strong and I did not mind it, so for those sensitive to smells I don’t recommended. It is a large bottle so I give it a star."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Australia,Toner,"Not bad, seemed to target everything i need but did not do too much for my skin. Too much essential oil and strong scent. Will probably not repurchase."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Australia,The Green Machine,"I’m in my late 40s and I have brown oily skin.

I’ve been using this toner in the morning for more than 5 years now. Once or twice I’d try a different brand and would always go back. It works very well for my oily skin and the humid environment I live in. A ride or die!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Singapore,Gentle yet powerful ,"It’s cooling, smells faintly of medicated oil, and doesn’t make my skin react. In fact, it’s helping with my maskne outbreak currently. Have already purchased the second bottle to stock up! "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Australia,made my skin red,"this was recommended to me by a staff member however after using the product, my face went red. it was like my face was on fire. I would not recommend this lotion if you have reactive/sensitive skin."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,YES!!!,"FEELS SO GOOD. Feels like a clean minty fresh and cleans deep. My acne has been generally improving(slow wins the race), but even if this isn’t the one making the difference it feels so good on my skin I will most definitely re purchase over and over again."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Australia,love love love ,Really enjoy this product ! I have suffered from cystic acne as a teen and they still pop up time to time. For me this works great when I soak a cotton pad and leave on those pimples for a while. It truly flattens breakouts overnight. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Absolutely love this product! A bit pricey but it works!!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,The perfect toner,"I'm on my second bottle and I'm still loving it. I have combination skin, with very oily T-zone. This toner helps minimize the oil without drying out the other areas on my face. It doesn't have a strong smell, perfect for my sensitive nose."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,The best toner you’ll ever use!,I’ve been using this toner for about 4 years now. I’ve used a few others every so often and I always return to this one. I have acne prone skin and this keeps my face clear and scar free. Highly recommend
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"I got a recommendation online from one of the online assistants for this product based on my skin needs, and I have to say that I'm incredibly thankful for this product. I was looking for a more affordable toner that could help with my oiliness and hyperpigmentation, and I can already see a difference after 4 days of use! Definitely worth it if you have really oily skin and sweat a lot."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,I fell in love with this toner!! It works amazing for combination to oily blemish prone skin. And it’s a gray daily toner. It makes my skin feels so clean and it has cleared up so much since I started using it
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"definitely controls oil, but it made my skin dry and somewhat irritated. i don’t have super oily skin so maybe this was just too strong for my skin. also helps with blackheads and pore size over time."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,highly recommend for oily combination (acne prone),"I barely review any product but this product makes me do this. I have really sensitive, combination, oily, acne concern skin tone with easily breaking out or pimples if the product is too strong or too moist for me. But this is the perfect toner that I have ever used. I use after washing my face and it makes my skin smooth and reduce the redness of my acne. Normally some toners I used before with too much oil or too moist broke out my skin, but not this. I bought this when my skin was calm, and it worked excellent when my skin broke out because of make-up ingredient allergy with tons of acne on my jawline and it was doing really good job! However I dont think this good for dry skin because it's gonna dry out your skin and rash. For sensitive skin, you should try this couple time first because you will never know if your skin goes along with it or not, but the mint in the ingredient will calm your redness."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Def add to your routine!,"After doing some research on skincare for my hormonal acne, I stumbled on this product & I absolutely love it! Such a great addition to my skincare routine!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"Just finished using the entire bottle, hasn’t really made a difference on my face. Also did not help with my oiliness either. Wouldn’t recommend"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,If I could I would give it a zero….,"But that’s not possible so I gave it a one. My skin is not the least bit sensitive and this made my face bright red for awhile after using it. Unfortunately, it made my skin feel and appear oiler than it already is. It just did not work at all for me. I ended up returning it and I’ve never returned a beauty product before.  I also could not get past the smell. It smelled like a fish tank to me. Like algae mixed with stagnant water."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"Love this, keeps my skin fresh & less oily! Smell is fantastic too"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,A valuable step in my face routine,"What drew me to this toner is that it has both BHA (the salicylic acid) and AHAs, so it's full-strength for unclogging pores & combatting oil. Descriptions also mentions a matte finish, which I find to be true. I still always have one pimple coming to a head or another (just crazy, oily, acne-prone skin over here that derms & prescriptions can't even fix), but I think the addition of this toner to my routine (day & night, next step after cleansing) has helped the redheads to get over themselves and return to a nice complexion much faster than when I didn't use a toner at all."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Australia,Great toner,Great for everyday use however I would say better for oily skins as it stings a little bit if you have a dry skin. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"Completely breaks me out, gives me more of a rash looking skin then anything. I dont have this many breakouts normally. 
My skin is ridiculously sensitive as well, so im sure it works for most people"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"This was seriously a life saver for me! I had gotten off birth control and was dealing with serious hormonal break outs because of it. I was willing to try anything to control the acne I was having but also to help the oil my face was now producing at rapid. In the first week of using this, I noticed results right away! It’s been almost a month of using now and my acne + oil are at bay! I will swear by this product!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"I got this in a box. I usually do not use toners unless they are the hydrating type because I am old enough to have experienced Sea Breeze and Clinique in my youth and generally find the added alcohol a bad idea. That said, I was pleasantly surprised that I did not feel this was stripping. I concentrate this product on my oilier t-zone and I think it will last a while. I do notice that when using these products my skin is not more dry but the appearance of (because you can’t actually shrink them) of my pores is reduced without having to put on silicone products."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Australia,I liked it! ,"I tried this due to my skin having major breakouts and I really really liked it. Definitely worth the try. I noticed my breakouts calm down and also it was so gentle, no harsh alcohol in it which I appreciated and due to the lack of alcohol it was very hydrating.  I don't have many breakouts now but I would definitely repurchase when my current toner finishes. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Australia,spotless,"This is my go to for when I am having breakouts, it really helps to clear my face up. This was my first Ole Henriksen purchase and I will definitely be trying more in the range."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,"A ""Forever Repurchase"" Type of Product","The Good: I have no idea how I initially got my hands on this product because our love story has lasted so long. This stuff is seriously a great toner, but it's intense. Depending on your levels and severity of acne also is dependent on how often you're going to want to use this. Personally, I use this stuff at least 3-4x a week and also as a ""toner spot treatment"" in problem areas that appear on my face. You can genuinely feel this stuff working and the best way I can describe it is that it feels truly ""medicinal"" almost. When I use a cotton ball and press this against a cluster of acne after a few seconds and the following minutes it's almost as if I can feel this toner penetrating my pore/zit and actively ""fighting"" the bacteria within the pore. It sounds weird, but if you use this product you know exactly what I'm talking about. The feeling to me is not painful although this product is intense and may be for some people. I personally find it refreshing on some level and enjoy the feeling of the product actively working. The only time this has ""burned"" or hurt my skin is when I have a zit I may have tried to pop or some sort of scratch on my face. I also see really good results when using this, it certainly helps with inflammation and can really calm down the redness and trajectory of a zit. I am currently on my 7th or 8th bottle of this stuff (seriously, thats impressive) and I will continue to repurchase it. 

The Bad: As previously mentioned, this product can be very intense and some people may not find it as refreshing as I do.

The Ugly/Honest: I know many people want to use tons of product of their face but this is a acid based, AHA product and should NOT be used with many other common skincare components such as Vit C or retinols. Double check your ingredients and try to use less intensive products in conjunction with this toner. I'm positive adverse reactions are linked to this mix/match cocktail."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Malaysia,i bought this as  daytime lotion,"So far so good. 
 I have bought the blue one and felt great, and I wanna try this green bottle. 
It is less sensitive than the blue one, as this is for daytime use
nice smell and nice price"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"It feels BEAUTIFUL on the skin!! It was hard to part with this product, HOWEVER!! It is not to be used with any other acids or vitamin C’s. It was wayyyy too strong."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Australia,Quality product,"I find this helps keep the blackheads across my nose at bay and doesn't dry my skin out or burn like some.

I feel my skin absorbs products better after using this."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Malaysia,Oil Control,Been using this toner for 5 months. It absorbs well and helps with oil control. I use it in the morning (with moisturizer from the same range) and at night. The best I’ve used so far to control oil production.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,I love this stuff. Really feels like it cleans and balances my skin. Smells and feels refreshing. Take care using it on broken skin because it may sting.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,New Zealand,really good,Only been using this product for a few weeks and already I really love it. It’s dried out all my persistent acne around my jawline whilst still feeling good in other areas on my face 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Love it! It’s a staple in my daily skincare routine.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Australia,just a novice ,This was great on my skin! I have sensitive skin and it keeps my skin healthy. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,Love this toner,"I really enjoy this toner. I am extremely oily around the nose and chin area, and normal on the forehead and cheek areas. I suffer from blemishes and occasional acne breakouts. Since I have used this toner, my skin has not been as oily throughout the day and it is not drying either. It tightens up the skin really nice, not in a drying manner but in the sense that my pores have gotten smaller. I recommend you to try it!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Not hype!,I love when products have good reviews & they actually work. I’ve gone through about 4 bottles of this already & I still love it. Now I alternate between another toner that addresses different concerns but this is such a staples! Definitely noticed a different when I was on my first bottle.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Just ok. Not sure I would repurchase. I notice more of an even skin tone but don’t think it does much for blemishes or oil control in my opinion
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,great for oily acne skin,"I have been using the toner for years and i love it for my oily, acne prone skin. My skin is much less oily than it was before I started using this and it got rid of my forehead texture!!!!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,New Zealand,Harsh toner.,Very harsh on the skin. Made me break out 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Love for combo skin. I continue to re-purchase and is only toner I use now. Dermatologist notices difference during facials.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Singapore,It works ,This toner works as it claims. Small amount goes a long way. It helps to exfoliate & clarify my skin and keep my pores clean. I like the smell; it is minty and fresh. It is not sticky at all. Will continue using this. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,BUY IT NOW,works like a charm! kept my t zone under control! my t zone is usually super oily. i’m in love
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Great toner!,"Due to oily skin, I have used a toner for many years. However, my skin has changed and is less oily now that I'm older. Some toners, especially ones for acne, are just too drying. However, this toner seems to rid my skin of excess oil without leaving it stripped and drying."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"I have an oily t-zone with larger pores on my nose. I know salicylic helps - an ingredient in this toner - which lead me to this purchase. Important to note, that I do not have sensitive skin - my skin did not have reaction or irritation after using this product.
I use this toner in conjunction with olehenriksen find your balance face wash.
I have found that this toner helps to control oil production. It is by no means a cure for all day matte skin. However, I have certainly noticed oil and shine control throughout the day, in addition to aiding the face wash with unclogging my congested pores."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Absolutely amazing,I do not know what is in this toner but it has totally changed my skin. I absolutely love it. I was originally using the balancing force cleanser with another brand toner and decided to switch to this toner and it has totally changed the game! I have been on a prescription medication for nearly a year and would still experience the occasional breakout that left severe blemishing and this toner has really made a difference in a matter of weeks
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Singapore,Great for acne prone skin,I use this for day time toner and love it. It does sting a bit but it makes my skin feels less oily and clean. I would love it if they have a jumbo size like the other toner.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Australia,It was okay.,"This toner didn’t really do much of anything for me. I bought it because of the oil controlling claim, but sadly it did nothing in terms of oil control. It did smooth out my texture a bit, but nothing that noticeable, so I wouldn’t repurchase just for that one benefit. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"Don't understand why this product has the allure stamp. I waited to review this item when I was done with the entire bottle, would not purchase again. I've switched to Farmacy's toner let's see how that goes!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,refreshing toner,"Been using this toner for two weeks, nothing happened crazy for my acne problem but I like this so far because it is refreshing toner and helps my skin waking up. That’s all it is about."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,Read my whole review!,This is the toner I mainly use! I put it on at night since I know it’s not good to put it on during the day because of the sun. I used to love it but it has started to not work so well for my skin anymore. I’m not as happy about it as I used to be but skin changes with age and product usage so that could be why!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Love It,I’ve purchased this multiple times now since it never agitates my skin and definitely helps reduce my oiliness. Love this stuff!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"I wish I could love this product, but I don’t think it’s best suited for my skin type.
I have combination skin, uneven texture, acne scarring, blackheads, and the occasional pimple every now and then. Oil control is actually not a problem I have - for a tip, you should not strip natural oils with harsh alcohols because it triggers overstimulation of your gland to produce more sebum so it creates a feedback loop. Anyway, I have good oil control, but I was hoping this would help with my blackheads and clogged pores and it just didn’t do it for me. My face does feel cleaner and “toned”, but if you’re like me and looking for a “detox”, this isn’t the right product. Granted, it’s not what is advertised, but I personally look for skincare that gives me something that I don’t already have."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,New Favorite Toner,"Love this toner! I feel like I’m forever sticking with this and will not try any other toners. It made my skin feel better, love the scent, does its job and doesn’t strip off your skin. All in all, amazing!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"I've been using this toner for over a year now since I first purchased it as part of a skincare set. My history with toners has been frustrating, to say the least. What everyone loved did absolutely nothing for me. But this is the first time I've purchased a toner and didn't want to scream after using it, feeling like I had wasted my money. I apply it after using the Pore-Balance Facial Sauna Scrub and my skin feels so smooth and clean. Best of all, my skin absorbs it and doesn't leave a sticky feeling."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,Holy grail for oily skin !,"This product has greatly evened out my skin tone and gotten rid of the excess oil around my t-zone. I usually get blackheads as my skin is very oily, but using this, I noticed that my skin began to clear up and my skin wasn't as oily. 10/10 recommend for oily skin."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,"Smells so good, good toner!",Honestly I don’t use any fragrance on my face and I invest in good skincare and this is my favorite toner!! The only fragrance skincare I have and the smell is so good!! I hate the smell of the blue bottle toner and wouldn’t recommend it if you don’t use fragrance! Green one is amazing!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Induced Acne,"Sometimes felt cooling and other times red and stinging. Unfortunately, caused a lot of cystic acne. Tried using and washing off still lots of irritation and acne. Had to discontinue use."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,It’s good but....,"This toner definitely helps control oil! I have combination to oily skin snd I have really noticed a decrease in oil throughout the day. However this product does NOT layer well. After letting the toner dry, I have tried to apply my serum and moisturizer (on different days) and both would not absorb into the skin!! They would leave a white film and just spread around my face. I don’t like having to wait 20 minutes after applying this to be able to apply other products :("
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"I'm enjoying this so far! It's true that you can definitely feel it going into your pores and working. I'm only using it once a day or once every other day because I'm concerned it might dry me out with my Salicylic Acid cleanser, but I love how it makes my skin feels."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,staple for anyone that wears makeup.,"I feel like every person that wears a decent amount of makeup, has large pores, or wants to get their skin right should get this. I use it in the am as my toner before doing my makeup application and at night before I apply
My moisturizer. I’ve definitely seen a difference in my skin since using it. I love that the smell isn’t overwhelming as other toners I’ve used. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a toner."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,5 star bottle.. lol.. On my third bottle and will definitely keep buying. My skin loves this toner.. I use it once a day and twice if I wear makeup
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"I have been using it from last 3 years and have used over 6-7 bottles so far. This one helps so much in making skin clean and fresh. Its such a great toner , I cannot see myself moving to another one.  Also it lasts so long. You can easily use one bottle for over 3-4 months."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,The BEST toner for oily skin!!!!! I will be using this for the foreseeable future. Doesn’t dry me out at all but makes my pores smaller and tighter. Scent is great too.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,a favorite!,"This is literally my favorite skin care product. I’ve been using this for about two years now and have no thoughts on changing that. This toner definitely helps with oily skin, especially in the forehead area for myself. It also has a clean feeling when applying it to skin. Almost as if you can feel it doing it’s job. It’s not too strong and doesn’t sting. It also last for a long time, so you’re definitely getting tour money’s worth. It’s literally the best toner I’ve used!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Great toner - DO NOT LAYER WITH OTHER ACID SERUMS!,"I enjoy this toner and my bf (when he remembers) enjoys this toner. I have dry/sensitive skin and occasionally get hormonal acne. One day I had a pimple on my chin, so I decided to apply this toner, but then made the Grace mistake of applying The Ordinary’s 2% Salicylic Acid serum on top. PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS! I induced a chemical burn to my entire chin and had to walk around with white burn cream on my face and have strangers stare at me (this was pre-Covid times). My fiancé has oily/acne prone skin and this does wonders for his skin!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Husband love this stuff! Helps with his oily acne prone skin
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"I love how refreshing it feels when you first apply this toner. One time I forgot it in my morning routine, and I immediately noticed how my serum and face moisturizer just didn’t penetrate as deeply into my skin. For how long this bottle is going to last me, it’s definitely worth the price!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,big decrease in oil,Noticed a huge decrease in oil on my face! I like it a lot but noticed it does not layer well with moisturizer. It won’t absorb as well. But it has for sure helped with my shiny skin
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Does great things but not necessarily oil-control,"This product feels AMAZING on your skin. You can feel it going deep into your pores when you use it. Although I don't feel like it does a lot for oil-control, it definitely does a lot for skin texture/acne so I continue to use it."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Good for acne prone skin,"First time trying it I applied too much and it caused a temporary red reaction. Second time I used I applied a much smaller amount on a cotton ball and lightly applied and have had no issues or reactions since. 

Currently am using once a day at night but feel I could use this twice daily and it would not be too harsh. I have hormonal cystic and fungal acne struggles on top of maskne and this has helped soothe itching, helped clear up blemishes, and improved my skin texture. My pores seem smaller and actually cleared. I’ve noticed redness and acne pigmentation starting to fade quicker with use as well. A lot of products dry or peel my skin too much but this product does not. I follow with a very small amount of balancing force moisturizer and it’s great. 

I absolutely love the scent and find it calming. Right now I have a mini bottle and will be purchasing the larger size for sure!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,"GREAT TONER, BETTER OPTIONS THOUGH","Love this product as it has a minty, clean finish and seems to clear up my skin and remove all the junk at the beginning and end of the day. I still prefer the Kiehls Calendula Toner, as it seemed to work better for my skin, but I’ve been experimenting as I’m still relatively new to skincare routines, and this stuff gets the job done well. Pretty much anything I’ve tried by OLEHENRIKSEN has been great for the price-point. If you’re looking for a go-to company that provides solid products at a reasonable price, look no further."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Love this it has a cooking affect while it’s fights my daily blemish or to all while still be somewhat hydrating
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,miracle product!!! MY SKIN HAS NEVER BEEN SO CLEAR,"I WISH I FOUND THIS PRODUCT SOONER! 
First of all, this product smells absolutely amazing!!!!!! second, this helped with my acne soooooo much!!!!!! I rarely ever breakout and when I do it Is during my monthly and even than this stuff prevents it from getting worse!! When I feel a pimple coming on I put this stuff on and its gone after a day or two. I literally rarely ever have zits or breakouts now. I'm assuming their main ingredient is the cause of this miracle for me is the salicylic acid which is for acne! (skin types differ of course)"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,ehh,"Wanted to like this so much! Cleans your face really well and felt great afterwards, but breaks you out! It can be very overpowering for certain skin types"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,"Good for acne, doesn't really control oil though","I use this product about 4-5 times a week, and I have noticed that it cleared up a lot of my acne + texture on my forehead! However, I would say that there is not a noticeable difference in how oily my skin gets throughout the day. I have combo skin with an oily t-zone."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,This is good!,"I have combination skin but more on the oily side. I read the reviews and thought I couldn’t go wrong with Olehenrikson. This toner is ok. I find it a bit dry on me, so if you have true oily skin, I can see this working really well. It smells so clean and so good though!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"Made my face feel so fresh, but made me breakout. I wanted to like this product so bad but I did not have a good experience with it."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,"While this product helped control my oily skin, I was disappointed that it didn’t help my mild acne. I’m sure there are other toners out there than do the same, help acne, and are much cheaper."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,ehhhh...,My face is even more oiler than ever! I have combination skin (leaning more towards the dry side) however I was still oily in my t zone and this just made it worse. Had to return I’ll keep looking :/
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,Love it so far,Have been using this for a week now and overall it has been a great experience. I have used other toners in the past but this one my skin just seems to LOVE so far. There is certain areas on my face that have had black heads for a long time...even after just a week i can see a noticeable difference to the point where I would say this product is actually pulling the blackheads from deep underneath the skin. Looking forward to continuing to use!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,USA,AMAZING,This toner is perfect. It keeps my skin blemish free. I’ve tried others but this one just works in keeping my skin well balanced.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Amazing! Soothed my irritated red skin right away and visibly reduced oiliness.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,Canada,Ole Henriksen Balancing Force Oil Control Toner,This product helped with my acne especially during PMS. It feels really nice on the skin and there is a nice sensation when using it in clean skin. This is my favourite toner and the only one that has worked well for my skin.
LANEIGE-Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Essence Toner - For Combination To Oily Skin,Singapore,just ok ,"I have been a fan of this brand since I was a young teenager, so I’m pretty familiar with their products. I bought this toner because they redid the whole line, it was just ok. The texture is relatively thin, doesn’t have any odd smell, wish it would come with a spray to facilite the application. I don’t think I will repurchase this item."
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,Malaysia,use it with the hydra life moisturiser ,"I use it with the hydra life moisturiser, the moisturising effect is really great. My skin feels plumped and fresh. You don’t need to use a lot too, so it can last a while. Great absorption too."
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,Australia,Mr,Works exactly like any other hyaluronic acid serum but in a more luxurious packaging. The extra bucks was worth it for the sensorial experience. 
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,Canada,DIOR Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,"Is it worth the price? I don’t think so considering comparable products out there and I’m on the fence about whether essences are required in the skincare routine.  

But it is nice - light texture, good hydration, safe for sensitive skin in my opinion."
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,Canada,Great for splashing on after swim,"As a swimmer during COVID times when we need to get out of the changeroom as quickly as possible, this is perfect for just splashing on my face after a quick shower to avoid my face feeling tight and dry without having to slather on a bunch of product. It also smells lovely, which is a treat after a workout."
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,Fine but now wow,"It did the job, hydrate my skin.  I did not fall in love with this. But no complaints so that I recommend this product"
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,Finishing bottle but not buying again.,"The product is mediocre, the bottle design is awful because it tips over easily and its glass."
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,dior is the best!,"I bought the whole LIFE collection... sadly I can’t go back to anything else. It makes my skin look brand new and dewy. 
With the essence, a little goes a long way. So while it’s priced a little more, it has lasted me already 5 months and I’m not even half way done with the bottle. My skin looks and feels more refreshed and smooth."
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,Works wonderfully and smell good.,"I love the feeling of this serum on my skin; it feels fresh and I love that and it doesn’t irritate my skin luckily. It is definitely hydrating serum and whether it is a huge change in my skincare - I don’t know and I don’t think so. Your skincare routine shouldn’t just depend on one product and think it’s a life changing. It is definitely a part of my hydration step and it does the job. But I use other moisturizers too and other steps to add hydration on my skin such as essence and lotion and then cream. Overall my skin has changed from extremely sensitive, acne prone, dehydrated and oily to smooth, poreless, acne free and combination-normal with my entire skincare routine. And this is part of it-hydrating and I love the feeling of it on my skin. Also the smell doesn’t stay too long so I enjoy a brief fragrance smell (again luckily my skin has become so much healthier so it doesn’t irritate the pimple out of my skin)"
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,Love this essence,I've been using this essence for years and love it. I have pale combination skin that leans on the dry side and use it every night after I wash my face and tone. This goes under my Sunday Riley Luna oil and is my go to essence. I tried another essence a few months ago and my skin lacked the hydration and glow (and even broke out a little). Highly recommend for a light weight essence that smells good and does a great job.
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,DIOR Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,"I didn’t want to love this, as I tend to gravitate more towards the natural lines, less towards the designer lines, but honestly, this has been a game changer for me.  Sebum and shine have been out of control over the last few years, and living in Florida doesn’t help!  In addition, my skin is dehydrated, prone to breakouts, and super sensitive.  Well, this essence calms the sebum production down, plumps and freshens the skin, my skin feels soft and supple, and the shine is gone.  My skin drinks it and it’s quenching the thirst of my skin.  The smell is strong, kind of perfumey, but I believe the scent is from the extracts, not from added fragrance.  It’s also very cooling on the skin, great for summer.  Last note.  Hyperpigmentation causes me to wear foundation, but since I started with this product, I haven’t needed it.  I think my skin has brightened, texture smoothed, which has been noticed by my aesthetician.  She told me that my skin looks much happier than my last visit with her.  (This was the only adjustment to my skin care routine!)"
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,Canada,DIOR Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,"I really didn’t feel this did anything for my skin, which is disappointing since I love the Dior Fresh Hydration Sorbet Creme. That’s about it. It smelled okay, didn’t make me break out; but did nothing. Felt this was just a waste. Not recommended."
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,Good but not perfect,"There are aspects of this serum I love but it’s not a holy grail. I bought my first bottle when a Sephora employee used it on me in store and I fell in love with the scent (strong but again, I love it). However, he explained it to me as a moisturizer, which it isn’t— it’s a serum with moisturizing properties but for a person with any dryness it will not suffice as the only moisturizer in your routine. My nose is perpetually dry and this was a nice added step in addiction to a good moisturizer, but for the price it would be nice if it had more miracle working power. I love the gel like formula and the coolness it gives your skin after application is really nice. It also lasts an incredibly long time— a little goes a long way and the bottle lasts forever with daily use so long as you don’t use more than you need. I’m on my second bottle but I’m not sure I’ll be able to justify buying a 3rd. There are probably more worthwhile skincare products to spend money on but, nonetheless, this is nice. If you have the money and it sounds like a nice added step for you, then go for it!"
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,Canada,repairs skin,"Many years ago, I had a lot of dryness on my skin from using products that had alcohol as one of the main ingredients. To clarify that was Chanel’s high-end skincare. Nothing seemed to solve it as my skin looked so terrible up close. I then went to Dior and they offered this serum to me. In just a couple of uses my skin completely changed back to its normal state. I’ve been using it every morning since. It keeps my skin hydrated even when I don’t drink enough water. In that way it does prevent ageing as well! It doesn’t break out skin and I have combination skin."
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,DIOR Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,"I’m a huge fan of Dior skincare. I use their Capture Totale line. This is my first time trying anything form the Hydrate Life line and it was horrible. The smell is so strong as if I’m wearing men’s cologne on my face and the tingling sensation was like having rubbing alcohol on my face, it made my eyes watery. Definitely going back."
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,DIOR Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,"I have been looking for a solid essence since trying to follow the 10 step Korean skincare routine but nothing worked for me until this. I live in a very cold and dry city and my skin seems to always have an oily t zone. I got this originally as a sample and my life has been changed. It smells great, my skin is less oily and more hydrated. I am now waiting for the full size bottle I purchased to come!"
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,Hydrating,"I love this product, its light weight, hydrating, and has a minty feel to it. It hydrates well and is a great serum for dry skin. I live in Denver, CO so its perfect addition to my skin care."
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,DIOR Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,"Feels refreshing to swab over my face before bedtime. A little goes a long way, so even though price point is high it’s lasting me long enough to justify."
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,filled with alcohol,"I thought the Hydra life series would be good for my skin but once this and the 2 in 1 sorbet water arrived I realized they were filled with alcohol. ‘Alcohol’ is literally in the top 5 of the ingredients list. I used them once (before I found out) and they’re okay. I’m a fan of the brand and honestly didn’t have any expectations, I just wanted a fancier skincare routine. But now that I know these are so damaging to the skin it’s going back. It feels nice now but I can’t risk what these will do to my skin in the long one. I’m a huge dior fan but this skincare line is a borderline false advertising mess. SUPER disappointed.  

Also? This is pretty perfume-y. Even when compared to my Lancome toner (the pink one). If you’re really trying to take care of your skin I really can’t recommend this :("
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,Good but too fragrant,"It’s good but I’m really struggling with the strong fragrance. I really don’t understand the need to put so much fragrance in skincare, it’s not a perfume. Fragrance is definitely an added ingredient and so is alcohol.. again,  why ? Other than that my skin looks more hydrated since I’ve started using this serum, the consistency and feel are nice. Can’t really comment on any other benefits other than hydration."
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,DIOR Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,"I use this as an essence, after my toner and before my serum. I love this stuff. There is a smell so if you’re sensitive to smells I’d skip on this one. 

For me, this has a slight cooling sensation - nothing obnoxious - it makes me skin feel ultra fresh and hydrated. I use this AM and PM and is the only product I use both am and pm. I have normal to dry skin and adding this in my skin care routine as an essence has been a game changer for me. It makes all my subsequent products go on and absorb so beautiful. It plays well with other brands. 

Will and have repurchased."
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,DIOR Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,"I've been using this in my daily routine, but I didn't feel any different. I don't think it worth the money."
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,Fair Product,"It is a good product, but not that fantastic. If you did not use this with the facial creme, it did not really offer enough hydration for the face. But I like its light-oilly feeling."
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,DIOR Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,"I love this product, it totally hydrated, but not oily, easy to absorb. strongly recommend!"
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,Love it,The best serum ever!
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,Hydrated skin that gets compliments!,"This is fantastic. I'm getting my 4th bottle of this stuff. It is so hydrating and light, and without a tacky feel. When I use it consistently am and pm, along with a moisturizer my skin clears up and stays clear. I'm addicted to the fresh smell and the cooling effect. Also, I have been getting more compliments on my skin since incorporating this into my regime. It lasts me 3-4 months as well. Worth it in my opinion!"
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,refreshing and cooling,Love this serum. I have combo skin and this dos not make me more oily. Feels amazing when you apply it. I personally like to press the product in with my fingers.  I really do enjoy it.
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,DIOR Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,I tried to live without this serum but I keep going back to it.   There's something about it that makes my skin clear and smooth.  I've tried so many other serums but my skin prefers this formula. Each skin is different and so you have go with what works for your skin type.  Have been using it for years. It has changed it's packaging (and name) and I thought it was discontinued.
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,DIOR Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,"I use the Sorbet Water Essence after toner and prior to serum, face oil and moisturizer.  This product has made a big difference in the moisture of my skin.  The skin feels plump and hydrated. Worth the money!"
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,DIOR Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,"As far as hydrating serums go, this is the one that has worked the best for my dehydrated skin. It does have quite a strong scent, but Dior doesn't add any fragrance so it's naturally occurring. The amount of product needed to achieve results is minimal and the hydration provided to the skin is fantastic! A must have for me, if you have dry skin I would definitely suggest trying this."
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,best,"I seldom wrote comments for the products I had purchased. However, this serum is the best skin care product I met in 2017 so far. I have really dry&sensitive skin and I use this product after washing my face both in the morning (before makeup) and at night (before sleep). It is very moisturizing but not sticky at all which makes it better than other products. I highly recommend a try. I bought another dior hydra life product called something like pro youth lotion, but that one is obviously not as good as this one."
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,LOVE IT!!,"I have been looking for the right serum that wont dry out my skin, which is very sensitive and have not been able to find one that reacts as well as this one! This serum in particular is perfect to use right after washing the face, leaving your skin smooth and hydrated! 10/10!!"
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,Makes my skin stays cool and fresh,I think this has mint formula or something.. makes my skin cool and fresh. I think it is good to use in summer or person with a lot of heat.
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,amazing product,I am amazed by this product. It's pricy but you get your money worth it. I love how my skin feel every day. It is fast absorbing and the smell is very nice. I am so happy I picked this serum.
DIOR-Hydra Life Deep Hydration Sorbet Water Essence,USA,FOR MY OILY FOLKS!!,"I absolutely love this serum/moisturizer. 
It has a gel like consistency and it is extremely lightweight on your skin. I love that is not heavy on my skin, nor does it leave an oily feeling or sticky feeling on my skin at all. It hydrates and plumps my skin. Get it! You won't be disappointed! This is amazing especially now that the hot summer months are approaching!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,Malaysia,edible beauty - n2 citrus rhapsody radiance tonique,"edible beauty - n2 citrus rhapsody radiance tonique

It smells nice and is refreshing. Has a dewy finish but bordering oily. It’s not a staple for me more like a luxury"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Smells divine!,"I love citrusy scents and this one has a great one! I don't think it does much for me as a toner, but I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate it. I use it as a face mist on the weekends or when I need a spritz. Definitely on the pricier side and this is my second bottle, but I wait for a sale or when I have a reward."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Edible Beauty N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,"Absolutely amazing. Agree with some reviews, I would also classify this as a mild astringent, but it works wonders for me (I use it during the spring and summer) and I love the scent as well as the esthetic. Have bought it twice already and would buy it more often but I must admit it’s a bit pricey for me, so I do alternate to cheaper toners. I also wouldn’t recommend this to someone who’s sensitive to fragrances."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,"Smells nice, doesn't do much","This product smells really refreshing but does not do much to control oil during the day. If you are looking for a really mild toner that does not control oil, this is for you."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Edible Beauty N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,"Returned immediately, smelled like Pledge & my skin felt like that was what I’d sprayed on. Note: I do have sensitive skin + am sensitive to smells, so YMMV."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Edible Beauty N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,I love this toner! Feels so refreshing and keeps my skin smooth!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,"Citrusy, refreshing scent!!","This toner is amazing! It’s a terrific summery, citrusy, fresh scent.  On top of smelling great, it seems to help calm my skin and gently clarify. Would definitely recommend!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Calming and great for acne prone skin!,"I have been having skin issues (sensitivity, breakouts, whiteheads etc) and decided to switch completely to edible beauty but was still using my old toner bc a lot was left. So happy I switched to this one! It smells amazing and reducing oil/shine throughout the day! Haven’t met a product I didn’t love from edible beauty tbh!!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Lovely!,"I love this facial spray! I feel like it tones my skin without over-drying it like some other toners. If I choose to use it as a mist then it feels hydrating until I can put on my serums/moisturizers. The smell is very orangey but refreshing and not overpowering. It's a little strong in the beginning but quickly dissipates. I don't necessarily see a difference in my skin (which I'm not expecting to, to be honest, with any mist) but I FEEL a difference - a few spritz of this right after a shower and my skin doesn't feel as tight while I dry off before my routine."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,So refreshing!,I feel as though after I cleanse..... this toner spray just helps lock in cleanse I have just done.I really love the smell and I especially feel extra refreshed when I use it summer. Not sure if it is doing much but I love it and it is part of my skin routine.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,My Favorite EB Product!,Now this is my all time favorite toner spray. I always have a mini in my bag and use it regularly throughout the day. So refreshing and my skin feels hydrated.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Magical,"This smells divine!! The mister is the best I’ve ever used- even, light, but powerful. So worth the price especially for the clean ingredients. Love!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Nice,"I have used just about every spray toner out there.  Came across this one and have to say...very, very refreshing and smells good.    I really like this line and now using 3 other 
products."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,It doesn’t work,This product doesn’t work. It is just water with orange scent. I think that all good reviews are bought.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,An amazing toner!,"Let me start off by saying, I cannot speak on behalf of dry skin so if that’s you, I’m sorry but my review probably will not be of much help. My skin is combination oily, but mostly oily (especially during the warmer months). I’ve tried not using products that label themselves as “moisturizing” since in my eyes, I needed the opposite. Little did I know that I needed moisture but not heavy which is why this toner provides me. I apply immediately after I shower, and while still moist use an EB booster, serum and then their soothe me balm. If I skip this step (which some early mornings I accidentally have), I can actually tell the difference! Idk if it’s my skin itself that’s different or the fact that the following skin care products don’t absorb as well without a toner, but I can tell when I skip it which leads me to believe it’s doing something beneficial. I do agree it’s pricey and that bums me out because I’m still going to buy it. The smell is incredible and acts as aromatherapy for me... really gives me a luxurious, spa like feel while doing my regimen. I use more and night and don’t plan to change it since most timers give me little bumps or reactions (I have eczema and sensitive skin). Overall, I’m super happy with this product and what the company stands for."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Edible Beauty N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,Powerful citrus scent. Very irritating and drying to my skin. I like the spray application but the product did not work for me.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Edible Beauty N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,Wow. Instantly brightened my skin! Wonderful citrusy smell and the mist comes out so softly- definitely feels like a luxury product. Now I want to try all the Edible products!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Wonderful!,I’ve been using this as a toner after cleansing and I’m very impressed by it. The ingredients make me feel good about putting it on my face. It gets everything my cleanser didn’t. Plus I t smells really good too!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,love the tingle!,I love the tingling sensation of this toner that makes me know it’s working! The smell is divine and I love how beautiful and clean these ingredients are! It really does absorb quickly and take away excess oils!
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Soothing with a lovely scent,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this line but loved the clean beauty standard and thought I'd try it as the search for ""clean"" toners can be tough. This one was gentle with a lovely, light scent. My skin felt supple after using it and I have sensitive and quite dry skin normally. I felt it helped calm my irritated skin quite well. The only downside I see is  the price. Lovely product and will be trying more from the brand."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Citrus HEAVEN,"This most is gentle and is one of my favorite pick me ups. I spritz it on throughout the day to feel refreshed and rejuvenated. Totally worth it, I love it so much!!!!!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,"Smells nice, but didn't love","So I normally use Herbivore Rose Hibiscus, which I love, and I honestly don't know why I decided to try this one instead, other than I am a product junkie, but I will be going back to Herbivore. No complaints, necessarily; it smells amazing, I love the citrus scent, but I don't feel like it really does anything for me, where I feel like the Herbivore adds another layer of moisture. Not only that, but I worry about the citrus reacting badly with other products I use, and I feel like the Herbivore is a more gentle product. I am giving it 4 stars because it smells good, and didn't break me out, but I will not be repurchasing."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,,refreshing!! ,Love this!! Not a lot of mist does perform well on my skin! This one is actually refreshing and hydrating but not too strong. I know this is more of a toner but I use it as a setting spray as weeeellll! Makes my skin super nice and glooooowwwwyyy
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Uplifting and refreshing,"Love my toner Mist and my sensitive skin drinks it up.  It's part of my daily skin care routine. I often use it through out the day too.  It's so refreshing, and soothing on the skin it uplifts your spirits too.  Even my boys use it especially during the summer."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,The best hydrating / skin refreshing toner,This is the best hydrating toner I’ve ever had. I love the citrus scent and the all natural ingredients makes me comfortable using this daily. It’s a true mist when you spray it. I spray directly on my face and neck area. My skin has been hydrated to the point where I’ve notice I haven’t used a moisturizer like I usually do. I looked this up on EWG too and it has great ratings. I highly recommend and will forever use this product.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Edible Beauty N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,"Toning mists are my favorite and this one is a nice addition to my collection. I brought it on a flight recently and it was so nice to have as a skin refresher while traveling. Moisturizers and oils seem to penetrate better when I use this toner immediately before applying. Nice smell, too!"

EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Edible Beauty N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,"Love, love, love this product! Incredible citrus scent. Super refreshing. I've been keeping this in my fridge and spritzing throughout the day as a little pick me up. Doesn't necessarily have to be used as a toner."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Edible Beauty N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,This is definitely in my top best timers I’ve tried! This toner smells so sweet and citrusy. It’s so refreshing on the skin and feels so clean. I love love love it! 10/10

Seriously every time I use my Mom always asks what the delicious scent is. This is definitely great for those of us who love a nice facial spray. I usually use this right after cleansing or throughout the day for some extra hydration.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Smells & Feels Refreshing,"This toner feels and smells refreshing.  It’s super light weight, so I feel oily skin and combo skin types would enjoy this the most.  I love using it in the morning before my serum!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Not buying again,"Other than smelling great. I didn’t see anything difference that other reviewers claim to see, on to the next search."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Edible Beauty N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,"Toning is my favorite step in my skincare routine, and this toner is amazing! I love how refreshing the citrus scent is- especially in the morning! The ingredients are clean enough to use daily, and it leaves my skin feeling fresh and hydrated. Love love love!!

*disclaimer: I received this product from Edible Beauty via the #PreenMeVIP program in exchange for an honest review."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Edible Beauty N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,Love the scent! Didn’t cause breakouts on my very sensitive skin.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Hydrating    Easy Application,"This is a wonderful product, smells great and moisturizes/calm skin very well. I did not notice a huge brightening effect but for me that wasn't a huge deal as the product has many other positives. Also, I love how the spray is much more of an even mist which makes the product extremely easy to apply!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Difficult to please with toner!,"I am really particular about my toners. I make my own toner and I love using it so for me to back another toner takes a lot. This toner is really good! It’s light and airy but I can feel it sink into my face after cleaning with the cleanser and leaving a canvas ready for serum or the day lotion and maybe some foundation! 
It smells amazing too!!!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Really refreshing toner,"I love how refreshing this toner is. It's super hydrating, plus I love the citrus smell. Love that it's green, clean, chemical free and vegan as well!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Best spritzer ever,"This brand has become part of my daily routine.  I've gotten the cleanser, both oils and several of the serums.  This toner has the best spritzer ever.  It is so fine, it would be great for setting makeup if you get too powdery.  It smells amazing.  I have a vitamin C balm that I need to work in with a facial spray and this one is beautiful.  I love Edible Beauty.  Clean, great packaging and smells like what I believe heaven would smell like."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,,smelly,i bought it cause the bottle was very sleek looking but oh my i poured the toner away as the smell was too unbearable for me. it makes my skin sticky too.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Edible Beauty N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,Love this toner the spray is just incredible. It creates such a beautiful refreshing fine mist. It hydrates the skin and is perfect underneath the no. 3 goddess serum or simply keeping on hand to hydrate throughout the day. Love all this range.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Sheer Citrus Heaven in a Mist,"Citrus Rhapsody toner is a beautiful product from Edible Beauty. It's pure luxury botanical ingredients really do work. I feel safe using this everyday as the ethos of Edible Beauty is to provide skin care you literally can eat. After using this lovely toner the pores of my skin feel tighter, and my skin feels hydrated, revitalised and soothed. The citrus scent is wonderfully energising and I use Citrus Rhapsody as a face mist to lift my spirits throughout the day also. The atomiser design is sheer perfection. It sprays the finest light mist. I love everything about it and am sure you will to."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,,I love this toner! ,"I love this toner. I ran out and used Mario badescu and my skin suffered... I went back to this toner and in a couple of days, my face was back to normal. Can’t rave enough about all Edible Beauty products. I’ve tried tatcha too and nothing compares "
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Edible Beauty N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,"LOVE this product! The smell is a sweet citrus! It's actually pretty strong, but I don't mind because it seriously wakes my senses in the morning in a great way. It is refreshing and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and nurtured!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Edible Beauty N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,Obsessed with the full line. This toner smells so and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I use it mostly as a toner but you can also use it to set your makeup.
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,USA,Citrus heaven!,"First of all this smells like citrus heaven. I love toners, and have even made my own. This one is great, and I honestly think it's because of the smell that I am so in love with it. Four stars only because of the price. I love the ingredients an what this brand stands for, but it is quite pricy."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,,a disappointment ,"Regrettably, this product makes my skin sticky (even if I stayed in air con room) and a tad too oily for my comfort. hence, not something I would repurchase again. The scent is nice and calming though. "
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,,Not so great,"Don't really feel a difference after applying this.
The only benefit is that the scent is quite refreshing and helped me to relax a second from work.

It doesn't help the makeup to stay longer neither doesn't it help to matte the face so I wouldn't recommend on this."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,,So so,"Bought this bc there was a sale to try, it smells really good and the packaging is very nice. however i dont really see much difference when i use it? Also my skin feels sticky after spraying it on. I usually use it before using my makeup. would not repurchase as its kinda pricy and doesnt do much! ): but it rlly smells good i would say"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,,Highly Recommended,"I love everything about this product! Unlike other toners, it's natural, smells really good, and comes in a spray bottle (so it doubles as a mist). I really think it did wonders to my skin. My pores have minimized and my skin's really smooth."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,,Not too bad,"I bought this because of the natural ingredients used and because my usual toner had run out and I was waiting for it to be back in stock.  Since using it for about 2 weeks, I'm quite satisfied with it so far. It has a very refreshing smell and smells very much like lime and lemongrass. I feel quite awake after spritzing it on. I would say so far so good, though I'll need to try it for much longer to look at the long term effects."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,,Relaxing and Refreshing toner,"Love this so much, the scent is something you would have chance upon in a spa...some sort of a lemongrass with lavender mix.

Very relaxing when spritz onto face and love the super fine mist! Definitely a good try of the brand as I was very excited to try when i first saw this brand."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,,Nice Smell,"I like the way the toner smell but at times, it does make my face warm and red which i am not sure why so. I continue to use it anyway as it is not every day that the redness happens. The packaging is pretty and sleek. Not sure if i will re-purchase though. Will continue and update if there is any"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,,Refreshingly Delicious,This refreshing sprintz works great for my combination skin. Its got a fruity zesty smell which instantly revives the skin and is quickly absorbed. This can be used as soon as the skin is cleansed or after applying the makeup which gives the face a instant dewy finish
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,,Refreshing scent!,"Love this refreshing scent of grapefruit n citrus. The only drawback is that it slightly burns my face n is a little sticky when it settles. wish the mist was also more refined and sprays more evenly, but other than that, it's pretty good!"
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,,Worth it,"I love the spray packaging of this toner. The toner itself is quite thick but it absorbs really quickly. It says it can be applied at any time of day, but personally I think it's too heavy to be used as a facial mist and I will only use it at night. Strictly personal preference. 


The smell is very citrus-y and natural, but I wouldn't say refreshing. I like the smell of it, but my mum hates it. Anyway, for the price, I think this is worth the investment."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,,Comfortable!,"This toner indeed has a citrusy and herbal smell that is natural. It comes in a spray bottle so instead of just working as a toner, I like it as a perk-me-up spray. It isn't oily at all and feels quite refreshing. Overall, I think I'd buy it again because it feels comfortable and the ingredients are skin friendly. "
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,,Like it ,"First time to try this brand. First of all, like the packaging, a sturdy glass bottle feels luxury. The product smells very nice, ctriusy and minty, very refreshing. I use it in the morning after my cleaning routine before skincare and make up, just to help my skin wake up properly. "
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,,taste like lime and lemongrass ,"Firstly, I like the thick bottle as it looks solid and claimed to be able to prevent light to pass through to protect the content. Tingling feeling on face after spray. The toner consistency is more on a thick side (which is good cause it remind me of fruit juice). No breakouts after use. I store it in the fridge so that it gives a super cooling and refreshing lift after a hard day at work. One plus to the spray head as it is able to control the area and amount spray (neat and no wastage!) when you pressed."
EDIBLE BEAUTY-N°2 Citrus Rhapsody Radiance Tonique,,Fuss free spray toner,"I love it's packaging and how it comes In spray form in a glass bottle. It feels refreshing upon spraying it after face cleansing. It comes with a citrus smell that's soothing. Overall, it's a affordable price point toner that helps prep my skin for the next step!"
EVE LOM-Rescue Peel Pads,Singapore,love,"I love this peel pads! Super effective but very gentle! I just love using it at night before my skin care. My skin is very clean now, stubborn black dots around my nose are almost gone. "
EVE LOM-Rescue Peel Pads,Singapore,love it,"This is a great exfoliant! My skin loves this absolutely. I’ve used this for a week now, once a day and loving my baby soft skin now. It looks way clearer and feels good! Highly recommend. The price is steep hence I recommend using once a day which I think is sufficient as twice might be too strong/abrasive and expensive of course. It gives a mild tingling sensation on use which subsides. I have sensitive skin but this works well. No breakouts"
EVE LOM-Rescue Peel Pads,Singapore,improved skin texture,"after using this product for 2 weeks, my skin looks much more even in tone. doesn't dry me out at all as well although it exfoliates. (I have dry/combination skin) my pore scars from using blackhead removal strips have lightened considerably, and so have my other blemish scars. the slight bumpy texture of my pores being clogged around my t-zone (which have never gone away) are now actually gone. really excited for the end result after using the whole tub."
EVE LOM-Rescue Toner,Singapore,Skin did not react well to this ,This gave me small bumps on my forehead after I used it for a few consecutive days. I'm still trying to see how I can incorporate this into my routine given its price. Probably have to use it sparingly and not every day. I'm quite sad that this product hasn't worked well for me as it seems to have done wonders for others. 
EVE LOM-Rescue Toner,Singapore,Rescue indeed!,"Have been using this for 2 weeks already and it really brightens up my dull skin. Although it’s a little pricey, but I’d say it’s well worth it. It works for me!"
PIXI-Collagen Tonic,Singapore,Nice for absolute impurity,This toner is nice for subsequent cleansing before my skincare routine. Suitable for daily use without irritation. Would recommend if you don’t need a toner with special treatment. The price is very reasonable too.
PIXI-Collagen Tonic,Malaysia,its 👌🏻 ,"It doesn’t do much on my face, no difference even finished the bottles. But it also didn’t make my face break out. I think it okay? I guess. But definitely not gonna repeat.."
PIXI-Collagen Tonic,Malaysia,lovveee,try to opt for another tonic from pixi and this one is my lesst favorite. it does not do the job. i will stick to glow tonic because not only it helps glowing my skin but it also act as anti aging
PIXI-Collagen Tonic,Singapore,Great Toner!,"Pixi does really great toners that are value for money so I wouldn’t look far knowing they provide a variety of toners to suit different skin and needs if I’m on a budget. Although I must say their toners might not be the strongest out there in terms of their ingredient content eg. Retinol, Glycolic Acid so if you’re looking for a toner with those ingredients in higher content then look elsewhere. "
PIXI-Collagen Tonic,Malaysia,mild and soft on skin,"Love this toner, feel soft and mild on skin. I have dry skin. Dehydrated my skin and a good prep before my make-up regime. The size good for my purse "
PIXI-Collagen Tonic,Singapore,Ok,"This is pretty decent. Not saying it is the best that I've used, but as long as it's hydrating enough for my skin. I will consider it as acceptable."
PIXI-Collagen Tonic,Malaysia,Not a favourite toner from Pixi,"The toner caused slight burning sensation and the scent is unpleasant. Not sure if it is effective as per the claim. My favourite toner from Pixi is the rose tonic - skin looks radiant after few weeks of using. I find the glow tonic too strong for my skin - after using for about a month there was more pigmentation probably due to increased skin sensitivity to UV. However, I noticed that all Pixi toners caused my skin to be oilier compared to when I'm not using any toner."
PIXI-Collagen Tonic,Singapore,Not suitable for my skin,"I have sensitive combination skin. After using it for about 1-2 weeks, my skin became very drying and itchy. I also noticed a few pimples developed. I have stopped using the product. "
PIXI-Collagen Tonic,Malaysia,nothing ,Well this tonic doesn’t gimme any obvious result. It doesn’t hydrate my skin also and i feel a bit burning sensation when using it. It smells like rose water and 100ml prolly can be used up to 3 months.
PIXI-Collagen Tonic,Malaysia,BEST TWIN!,"great smell! not much different than the Pixi Glow  Tonic (still can get great results!) like always , i apply it before sleep and my skin feel as smooth as silky in the next morning! and i use it as a base for makeup, just great! -xoxo"
PIXI-Collagen Tonic,Australia,it’s alright ,I use this as my morning toner as part of my morning skin/make up routine. Smells nice and feels good on my skin however I’m unsure if it’s doing anything. I use it all the way down to décolletage too. I probably won’t repurchase. Not my fave pixi tonic. 
PIXI-Collagen Tonic,Malaysia,pixi tonic,"this is so far an okay product for me. i used the glow tonic before but i couldn't see any fascinating results from it so i dont expect much from this too. but as long as this toner doesn't cause any irritation to my face, i am okay with it. i can feel my skin firmer a lil after using it. not regretting buying it. "
PIXI-Collagen Tonic,Australia,nice product,I am obsessed with the PIXI Collagen serum and so was excited when the PIXI Collagen Tonic came out. It has a pleasant smell and doesnt feel drying when using every night
PIXI-Vitamin C Tonic Holiday Edition Brightening Toner (Limited Edition),Malaysia,Good daily toner,Good for daily uses and easy to apply as other toners. So far it is okay to my skin but have not notice any changes in term of brightening function. Use it in the morning and night also.
PIXI-Vitamin C Tonic Holiday Edition Brightening Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,great!,love trying brightening toners!
PIXI-Vitamin C Tonic Holiday Edition Brightening Toner (Limited Edition),Malaysia,love it,I actualllllllly lovedddddddd this. I think it was really good. My skin didn’t react negatively to instead it made my skin glow. Worth it. Surely will want to get this again. It works well for me
PIXI-Vitamin C Tonic Holiday Edition Brightening Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,Brightening Toner,"I first tried the Glow Tonic version and I feel alright, the smell will take a bit of getting used to. I’m trying this brightening version, yet to try but hopefully it will be better than the Glow Tonic one "
PIXI-Vitamin C Tonic Holiday Edition Brightening Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,Great,Awesome product! I used it daily after cleansing my face. Finally found my best toner! Will buy again once im running out of it! Really in love with it! Thank you!
PIXI-Vitamin C Tonic Holiday Edition Brightening Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,PIXI vitamin C brightening toner,This is my 2nd buy. I can see changes to my skin after I finished my 1st bottle. My skin looks brighter. 
PIXI-Vitamin C Tonic Holiday Edition Brightening Toner (Limited Edition),Malaysia,not as great as its cousin,"This product is nothing much to shout about. I had high hopes since I am a fan of the Pixi Glow tonic. I thought the added Vitamin C is going to make this product even better. However upon completing the whole bottle, I do not see any significant changes to my skin. "
PIXI-Vitamin C Tonic Holiday Edition Brightening Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,Brightening Vitamin c tonic,Love the afterglow of the vitamin c brightening tonic! Lightweight and brightening effect is visible after use. Great size to bring around too… Smell is light 
PIXI-Vitamin C Tonic Holiday Edition Brightening Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,good good ,"Vitamin C toner (morning) + Glow tonic (night) = best combo. My face become super glow.. especially the forehead. Loll .. I like the smell too (saw many ppl mentioned too fragrance).. but for me is ok la 
"
PIXI-Vitamin C Tonic Holiday Edition Brightening Toner (Limited Edition),Singapore,Works well,"Works well as per product 
Need longer to see results "
PIXI-Vitamin C Tonic Holiday Edition Brightening Toner (Limited Edition),Malaysia,Smells like non-sugar Mirinda,It does not irritate my skin and smells like mirinda that reminds me on my fun childhood time. It whiten my skin in just one night and doesn't dry em out. Great!
PIXI-Vitamin C Tonic Holiday Edition Brightening Toner (Limited Edition),Malaysia,Good Product,"Love this toner! Purchased the Glow Tonic before but this one is better. Help with my dull skin. I normally prefer no smell for toner, but the light citrus smell does not bother me. Just done purchasing the bigger bottle!"

After consuming this lotion about for a week i can see my face seems brighter day by  day. I can see visible changes in a week. Please try this. This really works. Im gonna purchase more lotion in future. Definitely gonna recommend this to my friends 
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,"Great product, great cleaning",I got this for the first time in a sample box and I loved so much that I keep buying it now everytime I run out. My face feels really good after washing my face. I use it mostly before going to bed and I love the scent that leaves in my face.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Singapore,Cleanser,"This cleanser is for all skin types & doesn’t foam excessively so should be suitable for those on the sensitive side. It’s full of natural, certified organic ingredients which add to the effectiveness"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Hubby loved this face wash,"I got the 6oz. bottle for my hubbs to try out. He loved it so much, when he ran out, he asked me to get him some more!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,disappointed in product and brand,Meh!! Save your money. I need to stop buying stuff off here. These reviews sucker you in. So disappointed in the product and brand.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Simply amazing!,"Simply amazing. I used to use all those gentle cleansers people rave about, but this is absolutely different level. It’s gentle, but cleanses very nicely, so there are no traces of the makeup removing oil. It doesn’t dry your skin, but still perfectly does it’s job."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,Great product. Really feel like it gets all the dirt off your face at the end of the day. Leaves your face feeling smooth and refreshed.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,This product turned my boyfriend into a believer,"I’ve been trying to get my boyfriend to properly care for his skin since forever but he was a strict, “the bar of soap that washes my body washes my face” kind of guy... well no more!

I bought him this cleanser and the face moisturizer as a gift and he absolutely fell in love with it and uses them both daily.  He works landscaping and construction so this really helps get in his pores and facial hair and removes all the excess sweat dead skin and grime from work and smells incredible.  He tried to pretend he didn’t love it as much as he does until it started to run out and asked for more.

The smell is great and it works incredibly we even fight over it while on vacation!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Husband added to his daily routine,"My husband is one of those easy care guys. He does the basic: soap, shampoo, deodorant.
Then because is shaves his head (no hair left), I encouraged him to add sunscreen everyday in the morning, on face, neck and head. He  has very light skin. When I bought this cleanser for him, I didn't think he would go for it, but as he started using it, he never went back. Now this. little lives in the shower and it has been replaced over and over again for new ones once it runs out. The smell is light and not noticeable much on the skin. I recommend it!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Female Jack Black Fan!,Love! My boyfriend used this and now I’m obsessed with Jack black products. If I didn’t wear make up this is the cleanser I use. It feels gentle yet still cleansing enough your face feels clean after. RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE. ❤️
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Decent plain/clean face wash for most skin types,"My husband and I both use this as a morning facewash in the shower. We are both prone to different types of acne. He has oily skin and really likes it. I have combo skin prone to dryness, I found it a bit too drying when I wash thoroughly with it. So I started using a half pump and gently washing for 30-60 sec, does the job nicely and the scent is mild and pleasant. already bought a second bottle!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"i purchased this for my eczema prone skin and found it to be a bit drying so my husband uses it daily on his face and head (he's a fella with no hair lol) and feels clean and refreshed after use! when i use it, i definitely feel less oily and that my skin is free of any dirt or grime"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,Great for sensitive skin,"I love this stuff. I’ve tried countless products after having a facial which caused dermatitis on my face which then it started to scar, my skin has always been super sensitive and I never had acne before that facial. This is gentle enough to clean everything off my face and it’s soft, it’s really helped breakouts and formation of blackheads around my face. 
I have no problem with the smell, it’s fairly light. 
The face buff is amazing paired with this, especially in the morning. Not only for guys, that’s forsure."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,"Okay, but nothing special. Not worth $35","First time purchaser of this, I used it for a week and its just a basic face wash. I don't feel anything special about this deserves a $35 price point but its a big bottle and a little goes a long way so I'll continue to use it. Not sure if I'll buy it again. I've never had major breakouts so I cant attest to how this works for break outs. For exfoliants I use a basic st. ives scrub. I think the combo of these two work well for now. Doesn't have a potent scent which I do like."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,Absolutely love this cleanser. Both the boyfriend and I use this day and night. Smells good and it lasts long because a little goes a long way.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,The top/cap does not close so the product leaks. End up having to turn upside down so it does not leak out.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"It's a gentle daily cleanser that works well, but the smell is a bit off putting."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,My husband uses this product every day and has been loving how moisturizer me his skin feels.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Husband approved,My husband likes this product. His face does look more clear.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Love,I have been using this after the butter cleanser from Drunk Elephant along with The Oridnary Niacinamide and Zinc serum for about 4 months now and my skin has never been better! Ever since I hit my 30's I have been getting cystic acne on my chin and for almost 2 months now I have had zero cystic breakouts! I did recently change from the butter cleanser to The Ordinary's squalane cleanser for a makeup remover but I will never ever stop buying this!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Great for sensitive skin (and not just for men!),"Both me and my husband use this everyday. I have super sensitive skin, and most cleansers are too harsh for me. This removes all my make up and leaves my skin feeling fresh without any stinging or redness. A little goes a long way and so a bottle lasts for ages."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"I've used this when I'm in a pinch and don't have my regular face wash. It doesn't feel drying or like it's stripping your face of everything. My husband loves this stuff and is on his 4th bottle. No break outs or redness with use. Fair warning though, neither of us break out with niacinamide, however if you are sensitive, do not purchase. Niacinamide does to work for everyone. Some do break out from it."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,Holy grail!,"My husband loves this and he has been washing his face with a bar soap all this while. I cringed and died a little inside when I found out so I bought him this out of a whim and he's on his second bottle now. Great ingredient list, nourishing and non-drying. My husband has normal skin and not sensitive."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"Bought this for my fiancé, he absolutely loves it. Have since purchased other items from the product range and he swears by them. They smell good too."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,Canada,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,My brother always ask me to restock this for him whenever there's a VIB Rouge sale. He swears this is the best cleanser he has used which helped with his acne and clearer skin. He no longer have breakouts since using this. He noticed a difference within weeks and have been using this day and night for 2 years now.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Breakout,"As other users have mentioned, it worked for few weeks and caused me an extreme breakout due to over drying. But I think it works good as a cleanser if you keep up with moisturizer and other skin care products."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,amazing for both men and women!,"This is amazing. I’m sad jack blacks products are more geared towards men because they’re amazing. I got a whole set of products for my man, including this cleanser and I have to say, it’s incredible. This is better than any cleaner I own! I just started using it one off day and it keeps my nice and clear! I love it! We will both be using this cleanser from now on."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Best Ever,Got this as a sample and had to buy the 16oz. This is now my ultimate cleanser. Use it as a morning cleanse and as a second cleanse after my oil cleanser in the evening. Definitely does the job and keeps my acne prone skin calm!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,strong yet gentle and feels so good,"Initially I wasn't so sure about shelling out $40 for a cleanser but the amount of product you get will probably last all year if you're only cleansing your face twice a day. I only use half a pump as well, not to be conservative but a full pump is too much for my face. I love the good ingredients in this product plus being free of sulfates, parabens, unnecessary fragrances, dyes, etc. The cleanser isn't super foamy or stripping but has a nice creamy/milky consistency when a bit of water is added and is massaged onto the face. In the morning my face feels clean and ready for the day after washing with this and applying the Jack Black Double Duty spf 20 moisturizer (which also works well for me underneath my makeup). In the evening after using a makeup wipe this cleanser gently cleans off my remaining makeup and my skin doesn't feel like it's stripped of oils and dried out. The smell isn't bad either, fairly herbal due to the ingredients (looking at you sage and rosemaries) but not overwhelming and I enjoy it. I always look forward to washing my face with this product. All in all I will continue to use this product because of the amount you get for the price plus the way it performs, and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to try a new cleanser. Oh my only beef with it is the pump head popped off when I recieved it but it still works so it wasn't a big deal. I would have been choked if the pump was totally broken though, maybe they could up their game in how they ship this product so the pump doesn't break via shipping."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Staple,"I bought my bf this cleanser, their moisturizer and scrub for xmas once and he has consistently repurchased all three products. Jack Black is a great brand. He has sensitive fair skin (a natural blonde) and has had no issues with most of their products."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"I bought this product for my husband when he was having some sporadic breakouts. After a few uses, his face cleared up nicely."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,"Best cleanser, no matter your gender!","I went into sephora to talk to someone about getting a cleanser that worked to remove the light daily makeup I wear for work. I was told that there weren't any cleansers did the job perfectly, I'd just have to accept a double cleanse routine of some sort. Well lady you were WRONG!!! I got a sample of this cleanser and two others to try out, gave this one a go when I got home and there was nothing left on my skin when I went in afterwards with a micellar water. No mascara, no mineral foundation. Wasn't super foamy and didn't leave my skin feeling really stripped afterwards which was nice (wasn't exactly hydrating but better than a lot of foaming cleansers I've tried). I'd guess this wouldn't take off everything if you wear lots of makeup, but this absolutely exceeded my expectations."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Love,LOVE this product and I stand by it! Will never use any other cleanser! Didn’t even make me break out or have an allergic reaction like most cleansers do. Love the fresh smell and how clean my face feels afterwards.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,My husband loves this product particularly in the winter when his skin is drier. My only complaint is that this is the second Jack Black product sent mail order that has had a broken or missing part to the pump.  Would highly recommend that they package the pump separately in a box separate from the product with a lid on the bottle that can be replaced with the pump upon delivery.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,this stuff is terrible,"so I've been using this stuff for a few weeks now, I can't stand the smell, it's terrible and smells like floor cleaner.  I am not convinced that it's helping clean my face. Very disappointing considering how expensive it is and now I don't know what do with it."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. He was breaking out a bit just from not washing his face, but ever since he started using this, his face is clear! I also use it when I'm at his place. It's not drying and doesn't leave your face feeling tight, but also doesn't make it feel oily. Perfect balance!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Great face wash,"My husband loves this face wash! When I ran out of my other face wash, I started using it too! No residue or dry feeling left on skin. I’d definitely recommend this."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Good but smell eh,Bought for my boyfriend. He likes it except for the smell. Also he managed to break off the seal on the inside so now has to lean it upside down so it doesn't leak out!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,"Not drying, but would still recommend moisturizing","Doesn't FEEL like it cleans very well, however when I layered different kinds of makeup onto my hand (primer, color correct, concealer, lip liner, and lipstick) it took it all off with mild rubbing. After four days of use it hasn't really dried my skin out, however it doesn't leave it feeling very moisturized either. Has a slight menthol smell."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,This is the only cleanser my husband uses! I was buying the small bottle all the time. I am happy it comes in a bigger size now!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Best Cleanser of All Time!!!,I have oily skin along with severe acne and post acne marks and have been using this cleanser for 3 months. Im not exaggerating when I say this product has helped my skin tremendously! my skin texture improved so much that people where asking what products I have been using. I haven't had a major break out since using this besides the occasional pimple. Trust me you will not regret buying this cleanser.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Effective but drying,"Bought this for my fiancee, and he found it effective for acne and redness, but that it was very drying. If you moisturize, this would probably be a 4-star review."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"I bought this for my boyfriend last year and he uses it daily and has great skin. It lasts a super long time too I only just now had to buy another one. I got the larger size. I really like that this product doesn't use parabens, phthalates or sulfates too."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,A great face cleanser.,"I was on the hunt for a great face cleanser for my husband, prior to this he switched from Clinique to Lab Series and he just wasn't a fan, therefore he wasn't really using the product. So after much research and reading countless rave reviews on this product, I was so relieved and impressed when I got him to switch and he also really enjoys using this cleanser. So much so that I got curious and tried it myself. It's a great, simple cleanser that does the job. I can see why my husband likes it. He's struggled with sensitive skin and breaks out of any excess oil on this skin, but then using some of the products either dried out his skin and stripped off any moisture from his face, I mean, the struggle was real. So this product along with it's moisturizer, have become his holy grail of facial routine. Simple, to the point and gets the job done."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,"Bought 4 boyfriend, now use for myself",I bought this and the jack black exfoliating for my boyfriend and he LOVES it! We ended up buying a huge bottle and I’ve been using it too. It has a refreshing scent and provides a deep clean without stripping my skin.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,I buy this cleanser for my preteen boys.  The smell is great and not overpowering.  Keeps their faces clean and breakout free.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Dries out,"I bought the pump version of this in-store and after reading all these glowing reviews online, I decided to buy it (I'm female, by the way). However, this is more for oily skin, and mine is very much combination skin. I only use this 2-3 times a week when I'm having an oily day, because otherwise, it dries out my skin. Wish the product description said what skin type this best suited. Additionally, my skin doesn't look any fresher/smoother than before."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Good,Got this as a gift! Seems like the recipient likes it!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Good cleanser,"My husband really likes it, he has pretty normal skin and this cleans well without making his skin dry. I tried it and it's a little drying for my skin (female, sensitive combo skin)."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"This cleanser replaced my old clean and clear cleanser that i have been using for years. I started using the glycolic first but didnt want to use it everyday and switched over to this one. It doesnt irritate my skin , it has a light scent but not to overpowering. I use it twice a day and the 6 oz bottle has lasted me for a couple of months and it is still halfway. A little bit goes a long way with both products. These cleansers are more expensive than what i was use to but theyre worth it."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Oil has to overcompensate for dryness,Purchased for my hubby that has combination skin. Also is prone to break out from the gel in his hair. This worked great in the beginning but after a couple weeks it started to dry out his face way too much. He also mentioned its really dry after washing but after a few hours his skin is so oily trying to fix the dry problem.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Not just for men’s skin!,"I had samples of these that I got for my boyfriend, but since I ran out of the face wash I used, I decided to try this out. It’s amazing! It left my face so clean- but not that strange, squeaky clean; just fresh. And my skin was so clear after. I don’t have acne-prone skin, but I do get the occasion breakout  that leaves a dark spot. This stuff evened my skin tone and all but eliminated my breakouts. 
I’m planning on buying this for myself. Definitely worth the money!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,I got this for my fiancé and I actually started using it myself. It doesn't irritate and it cleans out your pores well
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,I bought this for my boyfriend to help with his minor acne and it works awesome!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Good cleanser for a good price,"This is a good, basic cleanser if that's the only thing you're looking for. Its primary purpose is to clean the skin and this gets the job done."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,My boyfriend likes it,My BF has tried a lot of products to help with acne and combination skin. It has been a huge pain in the butt for him. This products seems to help with these issues better than anything else he has tried.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"My boyfriend has always used bar soap and exfoliants on his face daily. I talked him into going to Sephora with me to look for a cleanser for him. The lady working there recommended this facial wash and the Face Buff to use a few times a week. He bought the cleanser and she gave him a sample of the Face Buff because he was not wanting to buy both and spend that much (such a guy!). He started using the cleanser right away and thought it was so so, This week he started to occasionally use the Face Buff sample and he loves the combination together and is ready to buy it."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Wow.,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 years, up until now, I have not seen his skin look better. He says he loves the texture and how clean, smooth, and gentle his face feels afterwards. He will be repurchasing.

I'd also like to add that I love the fact that it's a natural product."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Refreshing!!,"One of the best cleanser I have used. My skin is naturally very oily, but after a few days the chemical have been more balance and I don't get too oily that much. It has a minty feel after using it. My skin isn't overly dry after uses. and it's smooth. Works well for me. Thank you."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,AMAZING,I have used so so so many face cleaners this is by FAR the best ever. The feeling is unreal your skin feels CLEAN but not dry at all. This is a must try you will fall in love.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,My husband loves it!,"My husband works outdoors mostly and on project sites (he is in city-outdoor plumbing). Therefore his skin deals with the unfortunate weather, sun, dirt, etc exposure. He loves this cleanser and says it makes his face feel clean after a day on the project site. He also says his skin has been much smoother and he just really enjoys it. Nice to see he can enjoy being pampered!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Love it!,This face wash really helps both my husbands and my face.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,BF Loves,My boyfriend loves this. Got him the big bottle. Says his face felt like it was kissed by the ocean. Leaves his skin clean and not dried out. I tried it and followed with the double duty moisturizer it's darn good.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,B liked it,I bought this along with the First Class Travel kit or whatever for B's Christmas present. He said his face feels so much cleaner and doesn't need a lot of product to cleanse. Win for him.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Balanced out my crazy skin,"I get dry patches around my chin in the winter and then break out from having to hydrate it so much. I bought the travel size of this and alternated uses with my FAB Cleanser. It was amazing how quickly this balanced out my weird combination problem areas. My little bumps went away, the dryness got better, and it didn't irritate my sensitive skin. Repurchased twice and I highly recommend to anyone with any skin type. Ps. works amazing with a konjac sponge to lather up; it also makes you use less."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Amazing for make up removal,I originally purchased this product for my boyfriend and used it one night when I ran out of my usual face wash. This produce is amazing. It removed all of my eye make-up (including mascara) much better than my much more expensive face wash. It also has lovely fresh tingly feel. I love this product and will not be going back to my other face wash. It is also free of parabens and does not test on animals.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,Bought this for my 15 year old son and one for my husband. They both are very happy with it . It helps keep their skin clear . They said it also doesn't make their skin feel dry nor tight .
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,I bought this for my boyfriend because he said he felt like his regular face wash dried his face out. I used it myself and it felt really great. My skin felt really clean and not dried out at all.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Complicated at first,"I bought this for my boyfriend, who has adverse reactions to products rich in sodium lauryl sulfate, like Clearasil.

My first impressions where that it was foamy with a pleasant smell, but he absolutely hated it. For the first week or so, he complained about it breaking him out. Granted, he wasn't moisturizing afterwards..

After the first week and a bit of Jack Black moisturizer, he now seems to love this product, and has had a reduction in both acne and ingrown hairs. His skin also looks less oily, but he can't tell the difference."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Great product,I can stop looking. Great product at a reasonable price point. What more can you ask for?
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,It's good,I like this face wash well enough. It doesn't remove makeup but it's for men so it's not supposed to. I love it after my workout. It leaves my face squeaky clean and the smell is so mild. I wish it lathered up a bit more.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Boyfriend loved it,"my very picky boyfriend loved (not the word he'd use) it. He said it doesn't have a harsh scent and it leaves his face feeling clean. If he doesn't hate it, it's a good thing...."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Excellent,"Bought this with the Jack Black scrub for my 15 year old son. He went from acne to clear skin in a week and his skin has looked beautiful and clear ever since - highly recommend this! We tried a lot of other ""acne"" products - this is for every type of skin but it really worked for him when nothing else did! Love it!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,Not surprised. The foam is just like water.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,Enjoy using this product. Originally bought for my husband but I use it too.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,You'll Be Surprised,"My boyfriend picked up a bottle of this after one of his gym buddies raved about it. After the first use, my boyfriend said it was nothing special. A week later, he was singing this face wash's praises. He said it helped tremendously with his razor burn and ingrown hairs. The benefit I myself noticed was that he no longer has a slight sheen from his oily complexion a few hours after washing his face; his skin now stays matte and fresh-looking throughout the day. However, that's not where the greatness of this product ends. No, sir! Night after night of seeing a brand new product on my bathroom shelf that I had not tried finally got to me, and I gave in to the curiosity that product junkies find all too familiar. Lemme tell you, ladies, you will LOVE this face wash. It took off my makeup in one wash. ONE. It even removed my water-resistant mascara. It isn't hydrating, at least not for me, but it also isn't drying; I do use a toner and moisturizer after washing, though. As my purchase history will prove, I've bought a ridiculous number of face washes through the years, but I'd never found one like this. Seriously, if Jack Black repackaged this in something girly, women would buy this up by the truckload. More women need to know how wonderful this ""man wash"" is!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,My husband loves this stuff. It doesn't dry his skin out and helps control oil production.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Husband loves it,"Bought the 16oz for the hubby and he really likes it. He said that it smells really nice and he's really picky. In his own words, ""two thumbs and two toes up!"""
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Love this Stuff!,Used a few samples and they are awesome! My face feels so clean and pores are much cleaner and smaller even after just a few uses! Would recommend for men and women :) I am ordering a full size now.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser is fantastic,Jack Black's Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser is a great product for before the shave and after. It leaves your face feeling clean and new. I suggest pairing this cleaner with Jack Black's Face Buff scrub and Beard Lube for shaving.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Good,My husband loves it! It keeps his oily skin with large pores clean!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Blackhead Eraser!,"GREAT face wash. Gets almost completely rid of my teenage son's blackheads, which were pretty bad. I never found a product that actually accomplished this before --- and I've tried a ton of products. Amazing stuff!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Great,My husband just started using this and now swears by it. He will never use anything else ever again. He is diabetic and has very dry skin. It's helps to keep him moisturized.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,My boyfriend loves it,I ve bought several different facial cleanser for my boyfriend and this one is his favorite. And he's using his second one now. It's super oil controlling but won't dry his face at all. Try it guys!!!!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Not Just for Men!,"Yes, this is marketed for men, but boy is it a great cleanser. This is my go-to cleanser. Removes every trace of makeup, even stubborn eye makeup, and it works fabulously with my Clarisonic. I have sensitive skin and this actually helps with my redness and doesn't dry out my face. The scent is refreshing too. Love it, and will repurchase."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,I am a girl but...,I love the Jack Black product line. This Cleanser really makes your face feel clean and gets ALL your make up off. Even stubborn eye make up! It doesn't dry out your skin while controlling dirt and oil. I love this stuff and buy it for all the guys in my life (who all adore it as well!).
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"I bought this for my boyfriend who kept sneaking my face wash. He normally describes everything as ""good"", so I was shocked when he said ""I really like it!"" That's how I know this is a great product. I might start sneaking his face wash!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,A little harsh for sensitive skin,"Only used a sample size so maybe my skin needed to adjust a bit longer, but each time I washed I had quite a bit of redness and irritation on my cheeks. Applied a cooling lotion afterwards and skin was very clean and soft. Might not be the best product for someone with sensitive skin though."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Squeaky clean,"I like that this product is fragrance-free and focuses on being natural. At first I thought the consistency was a little bit too liquidy and would prefer something thicker. But once I started using it, I became a big fan. I love how it feels. Lathers up and gets nice and foamy. My face feels squeaky clean, but not dry or tight. Also not too moisturized; there's no film residue. It really seems to have found the right balance."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Great facial cleanser,"You really only need a small amount of this per wash which makes this a great value on top of it being a great facial cleanser.

+ cleanses well, does not feel like a light-weight cleanser
+ great clean scent (refreshing and invigorating)
+ non-irritating and does not leave skin dry

Am a big fan of this product and the Anthony Logistics Glycolic Facial Cleanser."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,No difference,"This product does leave my face smooth, but it didnt' really help my skin. I prefer the buffer version over this because this one didn't do anything and my face did not feel as clean as when i used the buff version."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,The Best!!,"I had no idea this was for men. I ordered it as a sample because I needed a good cleanser. Used it last night and I will be purchasing. The scent is awakening and calming at the same time. My face has never felt that clean. My pores were breathing on their own. My face doesn't feel that good after a mask, peel, or exfoliator. Everyone should try this."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Would buy again,"Clean, refreshing- a little goes a long way. Does not dry out my skin. Would definitely buy again."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Total Transformation,"My husband has FINALLY decided to stop using bar soap and aftershave as his skin routine and start taking care of his skin. Hellsville must have frozen over. So of course I rushed him to my Sephora and turned ""my people"" loose on him to pick the proper products for what he needs: JB Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser, JB Protein Booster Eye Rescue, JB Protein Booster Skin Serum, and JB Double Duty Face moisturizer. And $200 later, he has a new skin regimen! And has been using them all religiously to exact package directions.
It's been almost a month now and his skin has transformed itself. Wrinkles have filled. Dark spots have faded. Skin is tighter and smooth. His skin looks younger, fresher and.....dare I say.....dewey. He looks fab!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Good stuff !!!,I buy this for my husband an he is really liking it so far. We will continue to buy.
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Good for A man's Skin,"This product cleanses without drying. Doesn't leave a residue, either. Good stuff."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Works Well!,My boyfriend uses this and his skin has cleared up so much! It wont clean out all the blackheads and clear his skin completely but it has gotten much much better! I occasionally use it as well just because it feels good to switch between face washes!
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Amazing,"I've been using Jack Black products for a month now and everyone is complementing my skin! Coworkers, friends, family, even my friend who works for La Mer complimented my skin. Highly recommend it for even girls!"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,JACK BLACK Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser - 177ml,"I love this cleanser. It is non drying and removes the most stubborn eye make up. The scent is pleasant and well I know it is geared towards men, it really works with my sensitive skin."
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,fiance's favorite,"Well not from personal experience (because I am a girl) but i can tell you that its the only face wash my fiance will use. Every time i go to Sephora, he makes sure he has some ;-)"
JACK BLACK-Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser,USA,Great Face Cleanser,this is the best clkeaser - it makes your skoin feell so fresh and clean and alive!!
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,Toner,Felt a tingling sensation so not very suitable for my sensitive skin. Price is a little on the high side too.
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Malaysia,very powerful,"I would say powerful as this is not suitable for acne prone skin, for the first time, it felt very harsh on my skin and painful in certain areas.Maybe its just not for me. But nontheless its still a good toner, just be careful when choosing a toner that won’t irritate your skin!"
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,It’s okay,"Part of the PSA product line I bought. Again, like the other PSA products I bought, this is a very average toner. Did not see much of a difference and will not repurchase. "
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,average chemical exfoliant,Gentle enough for my skin but i dont feel any changes with this toner. It needs to be shaken before use and i found it quite annoying. The bottle itself cannot be a guarantee that $50+ will give you something.
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,brightening toner,"It’s expensive for a small toner like this. But I got no regrets purchasing. Yes, it stung for the first few times when I started using. My skin seems brighter. Now it’s part of my must-have in my usual skincare routine. "
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,Beauty Junkie,"Skin showed a little radiant after using this!

PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,Made my skin glowy,"Really effective and gives skin a nice glow. However, for people with sensitive skin (like me) it’s best to limit use to once a day at night or every two nights as using the toner twice a day can be a bit too harsh for skin. "
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,Extremely underwhelming ,"I wanted to like this but didn't and couldn't for what little it did for my skin after using it for a significant period of time. And now, I'm just struggling to go through the bottle because I paid a good penny for it. There are much cheaper toners in the market which do more for less.."
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,effective but too strong,"I bought this for those days when i have stubborn blemishes and not exactly for daily use. But everytime i use this, i feel that my skin is becoming more and more sensitive. I thing this is too strong for me. I might use it more during hot summer days when my skin becomes too oily. "
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,love it!,"Got this toner during Sephora sale. it is very hygienic as it comes w a stopper. So, everytime you use it, you need to pop the stopper. I am using this w Allies of skin product and so far, my skin has been loving it. Already repurchase my 2nd bottle! "
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,Good stuff at a good price,Toner works well and I think my skin is clearer. But I have been switching up my skincare routine a bit so it may also be due to that. Not too expensive for a 100ml.

"
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Malaysia,toner,"Love it. But I use only sparingly in AM routine, for my pM routine uses retinoid every other night. It does have tingling / burning sensation. One cotton could be two drops only able to use a long way."

PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,Makes my skin clear and glowy,"This is super gentle, doesn't irritate my skin or leave any tingling sensation.

My complexion became clearer and definitely reduces the healing tome post acne. "
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,made my skin dry,"The Scent is kind of strong and it felt kinda prickly on my skin, it made the sides of my cheeks a lil dry :-( probably isnt suitable for sensitive skin

"
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Malaysia,Great toner,"This toner is great! I use it twice a day. It removes the makeup remains that my cleanser don't remove. It also gives my face a subtle glow that is noticeable the next morning as well. The smell is quite strong, but you'll get used to it.
"
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,Great Ingredients,"I have repurchased my second bottle. Love the combination of Mandelic + Lactic acid, which does not sting the skin. Helps to reduce blemishes and gives skin a healthy glow.  "
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Malaysia,Nothing special,Was super excited to try this one out based on the reviews. Sadly for me it did nothing of what was stated other than being hydrating & refreshing. 3.5 stars for that & the nice packaging. Wouldn’t repurchase
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Malaysia,good,"this toner soo good but its so small for me hehe maybe i use with a lot of amounts on one use , but overall it make ur acne and pore shrink, and give u a little bit of glowy."
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,Must try!,I used this every night since I got it and I felt my skin is softer and a bit glowing the next day. It is really a good product to try! used it just like a treatment lotion. 
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,Clean & Glowing,This toner is great! I use it daily at night and I notice that it removes the makeup residue that my makeup remover & cleanser don't remove. It also gives my face a subtle glow that is noticeable the next morning as well. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I don't like the smell. 
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Malaysia,not that bad,"I really love this toner. I usually do not like 
drying or alcohol-like toners. But this toner is on the more hydrating side. I use it every night when I clean my face especially around my nose, where I have some drying problem, larger pores and blackhead problems. I am not sure if this is alone by itself effective for the pores and blackheads. then this one is a mild one that doesn’t cause any drying for me. just a for me its a bit pricey for small bottle."
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Malaysia,OK,"It does make my skin feel tight as a toner would. The after effect redness is what I do not like about it. Although it didn't persist nor did it hurt my skin to an unbearable extent, I find it annoying. Perhaps this is how it goes? 🤷‍♀️ But I must say, for those with sensitive skin; do not use this product"
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,the bomb,it does what it says.. I have acne in my chin area and this is so effective in clearing it up faster. it's very hydrating and brightened up my complexion after a week of consistent use.
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,very very nice ingredients to try,"I got this because it has so much nice ingredients in a toner! Mandelic acid is one of the in thing these days, it is an AHA that is much gentler than Glycolic acid so i really wanted to give this a try (skin got v stripped and sensitive after using too much and too often of the pixi glycolic acid toner). Love love love it. 6% is kind of a lot for me so had to ease into it, the first two applications felt tingly, but after that my skin got kindda used to it! But it is very expensive, a very small bottle (100ml) and I am hesitant to get a second. "
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Singapore,PSA Review ,"Amazing product! Can see the glow after 3 uses. Burns slightly more than Pixi Glow, use with caution. Will recommend to use this with the PSA Hydration Serum - great combo! "
PURPOSEFUL SKINCARE BY ALLIES (PSA)-Heroine Mandelic & Licorice Superfood Glow Toner,Malaysia,really heroin,"This is like heroin to my skin. My skin previously breakout. During MCO at home, i skip my night routine and day routine and lead to breakout and small bump all over my chin and cheek. I tried this toner and all range of PSA to calm down the acne and this really help. The toner bring me glow and not sticky at all. "
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Smells like Chanel No. 5,"Have just started to use it today so I have no idea what kind of result I'm going to get. However, I'm confused why many people complained about the smell, it actually reminds me of Chanel No. 5 the moment I sprayed it on my face. Also, I notice that the texture is really thin and water-like. It dries up within seconds after you pat your face, so it is not that moisturizing type of mist. Left no sticky or oily residue at all."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Malaysia,Easy to use,"it my first time using this brand. i have an oily skin, it makes my skin feel hydrated and refresh in every single use. would definitely purchased again. "
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Like blooming jasmine vines,"Not sure why others seem to be getting ones from a bad batch or old product maybe, but to me it smells like fresh jasmine just like the actual jasmine vines I was smelling the other day at the nursery. Light and clean feeling, doesn't feel drying. Only been using it for a few days but so far my skin is liking it."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,Pleasantly surprised,Love this!  Feels so nice spraying on my face and I don’t think the pores on my nose have ever been so clean.  Definitely going to purchase again.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Singapore,best toner,Previously I used Lush's Tea Tree toner daily to treat my comb skin.. I decided to give this a try and it was THE BOMB!!!! It's even better than pixi toner (which was my first toner during my teens) it's worth splurging!!!!
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Meh,"Decent toner for people with oily/acne prone skin, but it does smell like actual dog pee. Not like jasmine or green tea. Maybe it’s the witch hazel? It’s pretty meh compared to what I was expecting."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,worst smell!,literally one of the worst products i’ve ever tried. it stunk so bad! it smelled like straight up cow manure. i was so excited to try this but was so disappointed. had to return it immediately!
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Love the scent! It’s light and refreshing it doesn’t smell strong.  When you spray it on your face feels super fresh.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Just repurchased!,This toner is amazing! Keep my oily face in check without drying me out. It works really well with all my other skincare and a huge plus is that it comes in a spray bottle so its quick and easy to apply.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,"combo oily skin with occasional breakouts, Herbivore line is great for my skin when I'm having acne issues. it smells great and doesn't leave my skin feels dried out."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Holy grail,"I don’t know how many bottles of this I’ve used in the past 3 years. It makes my skin glow in a very natural way, and keeps my skin clear of acne. I used to have bad acne, and I was struggling to find a good alcohol-free toner for my skin type, and I never went back after discovering this gem. Must try to oily, acne prone skin. I hope they never change the formula for this product. A holy grail in my skincare routine for sure!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,"This was my introduction to the Herbivore brand and I was so impressed that I ended up getting their cleanser, multiple serums, and moisturizers on top of this toner. The jasmine Green tea scent is wonderful and refreshing and makes my face feel great!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Fresh Face,"What a great product. It keeps your face fresh clean, tight and smells awesome."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,GREAT for acne prone skin - Smell isn’t THAT bad.,I purchased this toner to combat my mask acne skin without having to use a spot treatment. This toner definitely deserves an A++ for results I absolutely love it! There is a smell at first which goes away after 2-3 minutes after application. Smell is  comparable to a rose/flower water spray it doesn’t smell terrible. Also toner is sticky (just like every other toner) for the first 5 - 10 minutes once it’s a absorbed into the skin sticky feeling goes away. I also love that this toner is a spray application as the toner is dispensed evenly on the skin vs having to apply a thick layer and rub in with your hand or a cotton pad. 10/10
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,Best Toner - Have been using for years!,EXCELLENT product. Have been using it for years. I spritz after washing my face and then apply serums. It's the best toner I've ever found that doesn't dry out my skin or have astringent properties.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Malaysia,Not for me,"I have combo to oily skin. I do have dry patches on my skin however after using this product for over a month. I find it makes my skin very dry. I think the scent is too overpowering. But the packaging and the bottle is big and nice. Definitely, will not be re-purchase this. "
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,First time I bought this I enjoyed it. Smelled great and worked. I just got a new one and it smells like pee. It already makes me not want to use it.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,"A product, F scent.","Like the product a lot but smells terrible such that I won’t ever repurchase. I’ve seen others compare the smell to manure, bandaids and urine, while oddly enough to me it smells like diaper cream, but regardless very unpleasant to apply to my face. Going back to Farmacy clean sweep."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,Amazing for combo skin!!,"I love this toner. It makes my skin feel clean and hydrated and I love that it’s alcohol-free. I really feel like it leaves my skin less oily throughout the day, and the spray bottle reduces waste of cotton pads! It’s pricey, but I think it’s worth it. My new go-to"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Singapore,hydrating,The product is so-so. Doesn’t really do much to my face. Not much difference. On the slightly expensive side. Was hoping that it will help control the oil on my nose 
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Definitely not jasmine!,"Literally smells like I spraying cow patties on my face. Why!!????????? Wanted to like this product so much, but can’t handle waking up and cleansing my face just to spray cow dung all over it afterwards. I do not understand how some are saying they love the scent. Heck no!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Do not buy without smelling first,I've bought two bottles of this toner. The first had a lovely light green tea scent. The second smells like a cow pasture. I can't recommend a product that is so inconsistently produced.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,My face feels sticky after using this product. Will be returning. Not convinced it’s doing anything to my skin but have only used 3x Bc of its stickiness.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Absolutely love this product!! Toner is gentle on the skin and it smells amazing! Within a few days of using it I noticed a brighter complexion!
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,don’t expect this to solve oily skin,This product feels nice to use but definitely doesn’t do much for oil control. You’re better off buying serums and moisturizers that manage oil. Looks pretty on my skin care shelf I guess...
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Love Everything But The Price,"When I decided I needed a new toner I did a lot of research. I wanted alcohol free , and one free of a lot of other harmful ingredients, too. I wanted one that would help control oil and refine pores. I finally landed on this. It met all my criteria, plus it smelled wonderful.  But it was THIRTY NINE DOLLARS!! But I had to try it! And I did, and now I'm hooked.  *sigh* It's worth it. Really, it is. My skin has really improved because of it. But I really, REALLY wish they would come down on the price!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,Not Great (if you suffer from acne/black heads),"This product is ""meh"". If you have blackheads and/or acne, I would suggest buying a toner that has more power and punch. It didn't leave my skin feeling clean or balanced afterwards. I've been using it for 2+ months and I'm not convinced it's done anything."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,I don’t personally like the smell of it. It doesn’t make my face less oily look either..
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Game changer and smells delicious,"Love the soothing scent and am really blown away by how well it works. I was away from home for two weeks without it and my skin turned to trash, even while using other quality products. I glow and blemishes disappear when I use this."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Clean pores and reduces acne,"I started using this product around 4-6 weeks ago and I have certainly noticed an improvement.  I have oily skin with sensitive skin on the neck and would still regularly get bouts of acne on my neck, even in my late thirties!  I started using this product twice daily after cleansing before my serums and moisturizer and have noticed big improvements.  My pores appear smaller and cleaner on the face.  I have not had any breakouts on my neck since I started using.  Even the gal who did my facial yesterday noticed my skin looks better :)  I will be replenishing immediately when it is gone.  I have had no issues with redness or irritation, and I think it feels very soothing on the skin.  Smells good, a mix of tea and herbal scent.  I have made no other changes to my routine since starting to use this product."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,"smells great, don't help with oil control","I actually really like this product. It smells SO GOOD. It's definitely hydrating and I use it throughout the day. However, I wouldn't call it oil-controlling. My skin can great pretty oily throughout there day, and this helps a little bit, but it isn't amazing. But it's better than everything else I've tried. I'm knocking it down to three stars because it's s too expensive."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,Does not work,I did not like this product. The only thing nice about it is the packaging and the fact that it comes in a glass bottle. It doesn’t actually do anything for the skin. It smells bad too. I have combination skin with scarring and minimal acne and this did absolutely nothing. I cut it out of my skincare routine and trying something better.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Buy this immediately. I didn't realize how necessary this is in my life until I traveled for a few days and took a small sample size of another toner and was miserable without Herbivore's. I love how this feels on my skin and the scent is bright and clean and helps me wake up in the mornings. Since using this I have also gotten multiple compliments on my skin looking really good.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Refreshing. Feels clean and bright without drying me out or leaving residue. Love it!!
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,"Great toner! Not sure if it does much other than add some extra hydration, but I like the green tea smell and the spray bottle."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,"This is one of a handful of products I keep using up and repurchasing. I don’t like that I like it, because it doesn’t feel as “luxurious” as other products I guess, but it works for my skin. I use it in the AM, and I notice that when I use it consistently, my skin stays clearer. It doesn’t dry out my skin (but doesn’t seem particularly hydrating either), and seems to sit well under makeup. I did notice that it smelled really medicinal/herbal when I first started using it, which turned me off of it, but honestly I don’t even notice the scent now."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Must buy!,This is my absolute favorite spray toner! Full disclosure I use glow recipe's toner before I spray this on and it's been magically transformative for my skin!
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,Love this toner!,"My skin is super sensitive so finding beauty products that don’t cause a rash or acne breakout can be difficult, but this toner has been great! My skin feels refreshed after use, it sprays on evenly and smells so good!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,"Really balancing toner! I don’t have particularly oily skin however I *can* get oily occasionally. Since using this I literally have noticed a very comfortable amount of oil on my skin. It also feels refreshing and soothing, and the natural scent is pleasant. Spray bottle application makes it so easy. I like bringing it to the gym but it is a glass bottle so keep that in mind. Overall so thankful the associate recommended this bc it’s not something I’d usually pic for myself as I have drier skin."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,Smells divine,I love this! Smells divine and the fact that it’s a spray bottle is A+
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Helped My Skin,"This is one of the first skin care products I purchased when I started to have acne issues on my chin. It has a light scent, nothing too heavy. If you don't like scent at all or are sensitive then I would skip. I love the ingredients and the fact that it's a clean product. It has helped reduce redness on my cheeks. I've tried other toners but this one has worked well with my combo skin."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Singapore,Okay but expensive,"It is okay for my skin, no particular effect. I like the glass bottle and green color though, doesn't look expensive as its price but looks cute ^^ I won't buy this again, will opt for sth else at same price like Fresh.."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Scent is too strong and not great can’t get past that to decide if the product would be otherwise ok
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,te,Seriously my favorite. It’s light and refreshing plus has a soothing scent. Would highly recommend to anyone who needs something that won’t weigh to heavily. It’s great for just a spritz mid day also.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,miracle product!,"This is like a miracle product for me! It really controls oil & helps with breakouts, all without irritation. I’ve tried so many products for sensitive oily/acne prone skin & they either break me out, burn, or make my skin itch. This does none of that AND is actually effective for my purposes. So happy to have found this!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,good for oily acne prone skin,"This burns my skin if I spray it directly on and it dries out my eye area, so I spray it on cotton pads and use it like a regular toner, not putting it anywhere near my eye area, and it works perfectly that way! Helps with my acne and doesn’t increase breakouts or cause irritation. I have oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin. The smell is pretty gross but it dissipates quickly."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,NEW FAVOURITE,I love this toner so much. I have sensitive dry combination skins and this product is perfect. It’s not too drying like most toners but also not to thick where it makes my face greasy.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Always go back to it,I have very sensitive skin and this toner is perfect. Has a bit of a smell at first but goes away after a week. I’ve tried many since I got this the first time but always go back to it. I do also like how you do not need to use cotton balls with it and how easy it is to get your chest and back.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,It's growing on me,"Works great! 4 stars for the smell. It's growing on me more each day. Very unique product.  It reminds me of something you'd find in an apothecary. At first I didn't like the jasmine water/jasmine tea smell but I DO like Jasmine and drink Jasmine green tea! It lightly, but literally smells like smashed jasmine flowers in water. The smell goes away very quickly, once sprayed on your face.  It works nicely as a toner and any acne I had, has abated since starting this, less then 2 weeks ago. I didn't notice any reduction in skin irritation or redness but it is very balancing and is not at all drying! The sprayer and packaging is simple but nice quality - and wanted a spray toner delivery system. If you like Jasmine flowers, then give it a try - works well."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Refreshing scent and feel on the face. The tea tree oil def calms my skin from irritation and helps balance my skin ph balance
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,"Excellent product with great ingredients. Green tea is full of antioxidants, and this is clean. I really loved using this. Only con, I went through the whole bottle pretty quick and it’s expensive."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,"I've had bad experiences in the past with witch hazel based products, but not this one! While it is the second ingredient it has listed so it probably has a high concentration, the other ingredients soothe it down into something refreshing and comfortable. I have combination leaning towards oily skin that is acne prone, and I do think it has helped reduce both oil and acne without drying out my drier areas. Will repurchase."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Must have for acne,"I rarely leave reviews on stuff but I just needed to tell everyone how amazing this product is. I’ve been breaking out for weeks now, and nothing’s helped. I pulled the trigger on this item, thinking it was a glorified face mist. Boy was I wrong. This stuff cleared up my skin in a matter of days, even those super deep pimples. If you’re on the fence, just buy it."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,It Always Proves Me Wrong (In The Best Way),"This product is pricey, so there have been several times I've tried to convince myself it's not worth the price. ""It's just flowery water,"" I tell myself. So, I'll stop using it for a month and...BAM. I start breaking out again. Then I think to myself, ""It can't be the Jasmine toner..."" but sure enough, every time I integrate it back into my routine my skin clears up. This isn't just a luxury product it's ESSENTIAL to keeping my skin breakout free (as much as I hate to admit it.) Definitely give it a try!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,BEST,"I struggle with dry skin and hormonal acne but this has helped me control the breakouts without drying out the skin. The smell is refreshing and subtle, i love it. Highly recommend it."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,"This toner is the only one I've found to not burn or dry out my skin. It's light and effective, and smells great. I'm on my third bottle of this, and I've recommended it to my friends."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Great for oily skin!,"I love this toner! I have super oily skin and this has helped keep my skin in check all day. I'm glowy not greasy! The jasmine smells strong when first applied, but you get use to it. I spritz my face twice during my routine, both morning and night, and this has lasted me a little over 3 months. I highly recommend!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,"Too strong of a scent, but very acneprone friendly","I hate anything Jasmine because I don't like the taste nor the smell. This one is no different. It's a STRONG jasmine scent; however, this CALMED DOWN MY ACNE PRONE SKIN!  I wish they'd tone down on the scent, but i enjoyed this mist more than I should've. I got desensitized to the scent once I finished the bottle. Would I purchase again? If I had no other choices, yes."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Great Summer Toner for Combo Skin,This is a great summer toner. It controls oil perfectly and leaves my skin smooth. Wouldn't use in winter though.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Refreshing and delightful.,Love this toner. It smells great and I feel instantly refreshed when I spritz it on! Works well with my other products. Combination skin.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Phenomenal,"This is an absolutely amazing toner, I’m in love. The smell of Jasmine and my face glows after use. I spray my face neck and décolletage and leave it on for a minute and then spray some on a cotton pad to rub it all in and remove any excess dirt and residue. My skin glows and is so incredibly healthy, this product really is amazing. Love Herbivore"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,"The scent took a while to get used to (very “grassy”) but now I like it a lot. My main issue is that the bottle seems to go REALLY fast. Otherwise, I like how this feels and treats my skin!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,SMELLS AMAZING - Helps me relax & feel pampered,"I am not kidding when I say spraying this on my face each day is the best part of my day. Tbh my skin is pretty low maintenance as is so I haven’t noticed anything with the toning. However, the smell and the light spritz alone just automatically relaxes me."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Not worth the $,"Personally, this felt like expensive water with fragrance. It didn't do anything special for my skin. It was refreshing in the morning but that's about all it did."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,"I usually love herbivore products, but the jasmine scent is really aggressive in this. i unfortunately can’t stand smelling it, so i can’t comment on what it does for my skin."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,Great for Acne-Prone Skin!,"I swear by this product! I have combination + acne prone skin, I use this in conjunction with an apple cider vinegar toner and first aid beauty’s ultra oat and cannabis sativa seed oil and it works wonders. It reduces inflammation and redness of my skin, locks in moisture, is cooling, and whenever acne pops up, it disappears within 48 hours. I personally like the floral tea like smell, the spritzer/mister works great and is also convenient; minor side notes but I love the minimalist packaging, and I appreciate the bottle being glass as it can be recycled. For those with acne prone skin, I highly recommend!!!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,"Not bad, kinda leaves my skin sticky if I spray it. Also kinda smells funny. It works better if applied with a cotton pad, and smells less too."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Singapore,Virgin try,"It is my first time using this product. It comes in a glass bottle, thankfully it was not broken during delivery. Item also came on time despite the high influx of orders during the circuit breaker period. Thank you Sephora! "
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,"Light face toner, love it","I have Combo/oily Asian skin. I use this toner immediately after washing my face and before applying my serums, oils, and moisturizer. It is a perfectly light toner spray. Very convenient how it sprays onto the face and will dry up on its own after a few seconds, creating a wonderful base before the rest of my daytime or nighttime skin care routine. I have had no reaction to this product and will continue using it. Definitely recommended."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Literally obsessed,"I swear, everyone needs to buy the drunk elephant cleanser, then follow with this toner and omg... perfection. My skin looks and feels clean, the overall color is very even, I feel moisturized, and my blemishes have been minimal."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Better of the Two Herbivore Toners,"I’ve repurchased this product more times than I’d care to admit - I use this in the AM right after cleansing; it calms redness, smells AMAZING, and preps my skin for serum. I use it every single day, and one bottle usually lasts me 8-9 months. Since Herbivore reformulated their Rose Hibiscus mist I find that the Jasmine mist is more hydrating and effective. If you’re between both I would definitely recommend this product over Rose Hibiscus, it’s worth the slightly higher price tag for a better quality formulation."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,miracle toner,"This toner is amazing! I have combination skin and I have tried many things to calm it down. So, after doing a little research, I found this! After a few day my skin was less acne prone and much less oily! It is my holy grail toner!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Singapore,Good for my combi skin,Fan of herbivore botanicals. This toner helps with oil control on t zone and helps remove any dirt at night after removing makeup and cleansing. Would definitely recommend. Repurchased after finished the first bottle
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Strong Odor,"This gentle toner works for my combination/sensitive skin as it doesn't dry out my skin too much. However, the smell is really strong, so I'm not able to just mist it on my face as the directions state. I have to use a cotton pad, because the smell is too much if it lands in your nostrils (think wood-sy funky smell). It works, but I probably wouldn't re-purchase this."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Effective and Gentle Toner,"Love this toner! I have combination, acne prone skin that tends to be on the red side. This toner is super gentle and has helped a lot with my redness. It doesn't have a drying effect like a lot of other toners do, and I love how easy it is to apply (I just spray it directly on my skin)."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,LOVE IT,"I love this toner, doesn’t leave my skin dry after. I use it after I cleanse my skin, also when I’m too lazy to do my whole routine I spray this and go on with my day. Definitely would recommend to anyone."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Can’t Do Without It,"I decided to purchase the mini set of Herbivore products, which this was a part of. I didn’t think it would do much but it has really helped my skin! Within a few days of not using it, I could see the difference in my skin tone. My skin is so even with it! Without it, my skin looked so dull. I immediately purchased the full size. My favorite!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,YES!,"This toner has been amazing for my skin! I use it twice a day and since starting to use this product my breakouts have ceased to exist! It has a nice and light smell, as well. Will definitely be repurchasing to keep as part of my daily skin care routine."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,Not worth it,"It's refreshing, as other people have been saying. However, it didn't do much more than that for me."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,"I feel ridiculous for loving this product. It really doesn’t do anything besides add a little spritz of refreshing hydration. However, the smell is amazing and the overall product feels so luxurious to use. Even though I love it, I probably won’t repurchase this, as Thayers toner creates actual results for me at a fraction of the price."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Bought it because of an amazing smell. It is refreshing but not more than this.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Love this!,I have been using this toner for months and I feel like it has really helped me with my acne and controlling oil! This is super nice to apply right before blending foundation and concealer when I let it dry too much. I even have the mini size to carry in my purse I love it so much!
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,,one of my favs ,"I love how natural this toner is, it has a grassy, jasmine fragrance but it doesn’t smell fake. It helps control oil but is still gentle enough not to strip the skin too much which I love. I like spraying it into a cotton pad/ holding it close to my palm and spraying it directly into my hand to minimize wastage."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,"This is the fanciest thing I own. It’s lovely, and I repurchased it because I’m a sucker, but it’s basically extremely expensive face spritz. It’s refreshing and smells like heaven but the ingredients list is nothing to really write home about and it makes your face a tiny bit sticky! If you could buy jasmine flower water easily this would be a no brainer to make at home. If you’re not coming into money I would skip it!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,no for me,This is a mist. It’s not a toner. Yes it refreshes your face. Otherwise it’s useless. It smells nice though. Overall. Not worth it.. especially if you have acne prone skin. Pick something else.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,I wanted to like this product,"I'm disappointed that this toner doesn't mix well with my skin. I enjoyed this toner and repurchased this 3x but it causes my skin to get cystic acne. I have combination skin with occasional cystic acne. I didn't know what product was contributing to my cystic acne so as you would, I took things out of my routine to see if my skin would react differently to the toner. No changes.I then alternated product I knew didn't irritate my skin or cause cystic acne. I then found that this was the product that didn't work well for my skin. This was causing my cysts. I was so disappointed! I wanted to like this product so bad but it wasn't benefiting my skin. Bummer! I enjoyed how this toner made my skin so soft, plump, and a spa like experience. The texture of the product was lightweight and hydrating. The best thing's has to be the smell of the product! It's a spa like experience, lightweight, soft, calming and definitely jasmine."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,AMAZINGGG FOR LITTLE STUBBORN BUMPS,"if you suffer with little stubborn bumps that don’t go away when you’ve tried everything, YOU NEED THIS. i suffered with these little bumps forever and tried so many products but nothing ever worked. I pray this on my face before moisturizer and this magic took it all away. This is legit magic in a bottle. Helps acne and smooth sensitive skin too!"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,I was really hoping this product would work for me since it has all clean ingredients but it actually made my eczema worse. Every time I would use it I would end up with dry patches around my nostrils and on the creases of my eyes and ears. Beware if you have sensitive skin!
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,expensive,"The only reason it doesn’t get 5 stars is the price. Refreshing, light and I even enjoyed the scent but over $50 for basically green tea scented witch hazel is a miss from me. Although Herbivore is one of my favourite brands I can’t say I wouldn’t buy again though."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Perfection,Best balancing toner for dry/oily skin!  Use before bed and before moisturizer in the AM!
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,In love with the smell,I love how it smells like real jasmine! As soon as I spray my face I feel so fresh and ready to go! I have very oily skin so this helps cut back and paired with the fenty primer I think its really working! Would definitely buy again!
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,my go-to morning toner,"So after using 2 bottles of this already! I finally can say, this is the best toner I have ever used. 
This toner has a very gentle smell to it, for me I enjoy it, kinda smells like rice grains. I use this in the morning right after washing my face. I have dry to normal skin. So I tend to spray this on when my skin is still wet. I don’t use a cotton pad, I spray it directly on and pat it in after. 
After 2 bottles, I notice my skin is not as red, dry and flaky! 
This has so many amazing ingredients that will do wonders to the skin. 
I would recommend to those who have acne, hormonal acne, or a toner to use in general."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,"Nice, but pricey.","I purchased the Balance and Clarify set which contained a 2 oz container of this toner. I typically spritz 2 pumps into my palms and pat into my skin after washing my face with warm water in the mornings. I found this very enjoyable to use overall, but I didn't notice any sort of results. It restored some moisture after washing but that was about it. It does have a distinct jasmine/floral scent, so I'd avoid if you are sensitive to those fragrances. I did really like the glass packaging though. While I enjoyed using it, I don't think it's worth the price.  I recommend it if you are looking to splurge"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,,not bad,"doesnt have a sticky feel, only need 2-3 sprays to cover the whole face. rather pricey for its size but as least it claims to be natural so i wouldnt mind paying more"
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,"I had read great reviews about this toner and was so excited to get in the mail. Honestly, my first impression was kinda disappointing, but only because of the smell. BUT it’s not a bad smell. It smells just like green tea. I don’t know what I was expecting because duh ofcourse it’s going to smell like green tea. So I kept using it for about a week just to see if it did anything. And I’m glad I did because I started to notice that my skin felt so balanced, clean & comfortable right before applying my serum & moisturizer. I only need to spray 3 to 4 times and never have to wipe any excess in with a cotton pad. The spray component looks like a regular pump spray action but is surprisingly very fine and soft like a micro mist. The glass bottle is so pretty I like to leave it out on the counter. Overall, I’m so impressed with this product. I have combo skin, but would recommend this for all skin types too."
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Canada,Causes itchiness,"Beautiful packaging and it smells great, it helps with oil control but makes my face feel really dry after putting it on. Like I feel like I need to rush to get a moisturizer on because it's so uncomfortably dry, and makes my face itchy. I wanted to love it but my face says no :("
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,The smell isn’t my favorite and takes some getting use to. I got this as a gift and use here and there. Definitely refreshing and soothing; I use this before I put on any primer and makeup. I don’t think it’s worth the price.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,HERBIVORE BOTANICALS Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,Absolutely love this brand and especially this product! Buying it all the time!
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,Only for skin with existing acne,This toner smells great but made me break out with tiny pimples... I think this toner is ONLY for people with acne... If you have clear skin it just dries your skin out which then makes your face produce more oil which leads to said breakouts.
HERBIVORE BOTANICALS-Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner,USA,"Terrible smell, okay product","I've tried many things from the Herbivore line so far and this is my least favorite so far. I am not really sensitive to smells but boy this stuff smells truly awful. I really don't understand the reviews saying that it smells ""good"" and that makes me wonder if some batches of the product are turning bad. I have to cover up the scent by putting on some Mario Badescu rose toner right after. As far as balancing/toning benefits, I haven't noticed anything worth writing home about. The 3 stars are for the clean ingredients and packaging."
DERMALOGICA-Antioxidant Hydramist,Canada,DERMALOGICA Antioxidant Hydramist,Love it. Refreshing and moisturizing. I use it every morning and evening.
DERMALOGICA-Antioxidant Hydramist,Canada,DERMALOGICA Antioxidant Hydramist,Love. Love. Love this toning mist. I hate having to use cotton pads with toners. No time for that. This toner allows you to quickly mist and move on with the rest of my routine. Will buy again. A+++
DERMALOGICA-Antioxidant Hydramist,Canada,DERMALOGICA Antioxidant Hydramist,One of my favourite dermalogica products. Have repurchased multiple times even at its ridiculous price.
DERMALOGICA-Antioxidant Hydramist,Canada,Amazing toner,"I trained with Dermalogica and love a lot of their products, this being the best toner I've used so far! Toners are so important if you are double cleansing your face, I would also highly recommend the Dermalogica Multi-Active toner if you are new to toners or Dermalogica products."
DERMALOGICA-Antioxidant Hydramist,USA,Favourite Toner,"Smells amazing, super light and makes your face feel hydrated. I love how you don’t need to rub at all because you just need a few spritzes, no tugging from cotton balls."
DERMALOGICA-Antioxidant Hydramist,USA,DERMALOGICA Antioxidant Hydramist,"I don't think it does what it claims (about fine lines or aging) but it definitely smells amazing (cloves!) and is a nice refreshing spray to use throughout the day that doesn't mess up makeup. A hefty price tag for that, though, so docked a star!"
ORIGINS-Checks & Balances Frothy Face Wash Duo,Singapore,ms,"Good value for the duo pack. Clean wash without over dry, and the foam is a lot compare to other cleanser. I will rotate this with milder cleanser, else maybe a little drying."
ORIGINS-Checks & Balances Frothy Face Wash Duo,Singapore,Frothy Frothy,"Favourite facial wash. One for one is a very good deal, bought 4 tubes. Just before the sales bought one.. haha now having 5 tubes yet opened. Feel fresh & clean after wash. A day twice will be sufficient. "
ORIGINS-Checks & Balances Frothy Face Wash Duo,Singapore,Great cleanser!,"Been using this for years now and it helps to clean my skin really well at the end of the day! Usually gently massage, but be sure not to leave it too long as it can be a little drying. Works great on my combination skin. "
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Malaysia,the ordinary ,"I really like this the ordinary  Glycolic Acid , love and suitable for my skin. Always  repeat and continue for my skin routine , 1 week 3time fir night  and I can see the process 👍"
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Philippines,Good find,The glycolic acid of The Ordinary is amazing. it is worth the price. I have been using this for a while and my skin has been clearing up. i will definitely buy again.
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Australia,the ordinary,Exited to use this one and expect to be good as its hype❤️ I hope this work like other The Ordinary products works❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Canada,All I need,My skin has never been “nice”. I’ve always had quick oil producing skin with bumpy dry texture. Skin using this and not wearing makeup my skin is soft and smooth and beautiful. This is all I use and sometimes some other ordinary products.
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Malaysia,love,so glad Sephora brought the ordinary line in - absolute staple in routine - works brilliantly - just wish they'd restock quicker - constantly out of stock 
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Canada,holy grail,"I have dry skin and it makes my face peel so I use it for back acne instead. It's amazing. My back acne problem has been bothering me for years, even salicylic acid doesn't work. I use the toner after shower every day and there's no new acne ever since. Scars are still here but they are fading. Will continue using it and 100% recommended."
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,USA,Works great,It is a multi use. Great product for underarm instead for deodorant
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Singapore,The Ordinary - Glycolic Acid 7%,"Good product, been using it for two weeks now and see a slight change in my underarms and face. My face is more glowy than usual after using this product. "
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Singapore,multipurpose product,"This is a product I always have on rotation and have repurchased multiple times. I use it primarily for my body skin as I have a lot of old scars (primarily of the hyperpigmentation kind) on my bum, back and legs from years of a combination of eczema, mosquito bites, body acne, ingrown hair etc and I apply it on my body like I would a toner, at least 4-5 times a week. After a year and a half of this, it’s made a huge improvement. My scars used to be so dark and obvious, and now they’ve faded to light shadows. It’s not fully gone but I’m confident with more time, it will be. It’s also great as a deodorant! However, it does not work so great for my face, I suspect it’s too strong."
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Canada,WORKS!,I used this for my face and underarms. I love it. It really does the job for me. I have combo skin for reference.
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Canada,"Love, just a little too intense with my Retin-A.","I love this acid, and it worked very well for my dry, acne-prone skin. I was much happier with my second repurchase, where The Ordinary added a lid that could be used for dispensing, as opposed to the flat cap (I struggled much more with application prior to this). Now that I have been on weekly Retin-A treatments, I have had to stop using this and other actives, as they intensify the peeling and even cause breakouts. This has nothing to do with the product itself, but the intensity of the Retin-A combined with other actives on my skin. I’m hoping to gradually be able to use one active a week once my skin calms down, but will likely opt for The Ordinary’s lactic acid as it’s slightly more hydrating. But I did use this very often prior to prescription, and it was my preferred acid treatment."
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Australia,glycolic acid solution,"I bought this to use on the KP bumps I have on my arms and so far it seems to be helping. They haven’t completely disappeared but they are less noticeable and I think with a consistent routine they’ll go away. 

I think the percentage of glycolic acid would be too harsh for most faces though. "
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Malaysia,The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,"I am loving this product so much. Had some blemishes and dark spots from a bad waxing session for like 2 months. I see a big difference in those dark spots after start using the toning solution, it has faded away slowly and is unnoticeable now.
Using it once a day in the evening routine. "
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Malaysia,twice a week,using this on my snowflake scalp. after wash a hair straight away apply this on my scalp. so far no more flaky scalp and the bottle is big. i hope this one tahan a years cz there’s no stock around at sephora lol
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Malaysia,My Current Obsession,I heard many good review about this glycolic acid toning solution. I have tried it especially to my face. It really work wonder to remove all impurities and dirt. And sometimes I use it to wipe my armpit and around decollete area to remove rough texture and brown spots.
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Singapore,For sensitive and uneven tone ,"Really this toner too worth for money.
My skin too soft and moist . This toner very thick type and easy to observe . No need to worried about this toner . just try and feel it "
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Singapore,Love it!,I think this works great! I saw some change within the first few minutes of application. Can wait to continue using it and see the difference. Thank you
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Canada,great as part of skin cycling routine,it's a bit strong so a little goes a long way with this product. it definitely worked wonders with clearing my skin
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,USA,The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,I used it only once but i can already see result. I'm going to continue using and see if it actually works in long term.
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,USA,No difference,Ive been using this for a while started out slowly 1 time per week and now 2 x per week but I don't see a good or bad change on my skin.
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,New Zealand,Love this toner,"Love using this toner nightly, quite strong so if your skin's not used to this strength acid I would recommend getting something slightly more gentle.  "
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Australia,Game Changer,"I use this all over. Hair/scalp, face and body. Works amazingly well for me. It’s really strong though so be careful especially if you have sensitive skin. I only use it once a week on my face but the difference it makes is incredible."
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Singapore,Multipurpose,bought multi times because i go through it very fast! super effective in clearing the skin but do not use it daily as it can be drying. i use this in my exfoliation night (skin cycling ftw). used it on my underarm as well! 
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,USA,Love hate relationship tbh,"I typically have pretty sensitive skin, but no product has EVER given me a chemical burn! Not the products fault, just my own. Used on underarms to help with smell and it burned my skin so bad :( AMAZING for my hair care routine!! Always helps so much with dandruff and for my wash days in general!"
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,USA,effective to reduce odor,it helps to reduce odor but I cannot see it lightening armpits. I did not use it regularly though minus one star because they increased the price from 7 to 10
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Australia,Would recommend ,"Absolutely love it so much! My skin is very sensitive to products but this worked perfectly fine on my skin! It does its job very well, so I would definitely recommend for anyone! "
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Malaysia,Good for exfoliation,"I think this is a decent product for body exfoliation, not for face. I feel this product is a bit harsh if use on the face. Great for your hair scalp too!"
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Singapore,it’s okay?,"Still getting pimples on my face but good for underarms, dead skin does come off after multiple usage. Not religious on the application but can see the potential "
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Canada,Too strong for face,"I didn't like this product for my skin. Way too strong for me. I believe it damaged my moisture barrier. I think if you are interested in this product, you should do a patch test (which I didn't do). It might be useful for other functions, like for dandruff, but I didn't try it for that. I thought it would be a good facial exfoliant, but its a no for me."
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,USA,Part of My Nighttime Routine,"It’s an excellent product that works well for me to remove all of the dirt, oil and sweat off of my face after a long day."
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Canada,Too Strong,unfortunately this product was too strong for my sensitive skin. I did not like how my skin felt the next day after using this. After watching some tik toks I found that using it on my scalp before washing my hair worked well for my oily hair! Weird life hack but at least I can use the rest of the bottle somehow.
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,USA,TikTok Beauty Hack for deodorant replacement works,"Only purchased this product b/c I saw the tiktok beauty hack of people using it b/c it supposedly worked for dark armpits and replaced deodorant. While I can't attest of the lightening of the under arms, I can attest that it actually completely deodorizes. I live in a super hot state where it's typically 90 degrees all day and having been using this for weeks now. I have not had to use deodorant since I started using this and I don't have any smell at all. I use once a day after my shower and do not have to reapply until the next shower. I'm literally amazed! You will however still sweat if you're running around outside or working out. I have not had any irritation or bad smell. I am loving this!"
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,USA,It's sticky,"I usually love The Ordinary products, and although this toner is not bad, it does leave my face very sticky, which I find unpleasant.  It never dries down to the point that it isn't sticky, so I only use it at bedtime, since I wouldn't be able to tolerate it any other time of the day."
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Singapore,good but strong,Cheap and affordable for its price point but might be abit too strong for those with sensitive skin i think. Should do patch test first before using! Always sold out in stores so better to get it online too
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Singapore,ok,"Not sure if it actually works for lightening of skin…I used it w cotton pad on my underarms, my knee and my back..bacne got better but for my underarms and knee haven’t rly seen a diff in it getting lighter."
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Singapore,multipurpose,"can be used for face, underarms and many skin areas with hyperpigmentation. would recommend to buy from sephora since there are too many fakes on other platforms "
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Brunei,glycolic acid,"i really love this item, i feel so fresh in the morning cos i use it daily before bed time. its really nice "
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Canada,Fades dark marks and hyperpigmentation quickly!,"This is my holy grail, after trying so many products for my skin and expecting to see results for my dark marks and hyperpigmentations.

THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Australia,acne,"helps a lot with acne i heard so i’m going to try it and see if it actually does anything, apparently it’s really versatile so we will see high hopes since i really want my dark spots and acne gone "
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,USA,miracle worker for body,"it is a little strong to use on the face, but it works wonders on the body, helps with texture, ingrown hairs, strawberry legs, and post acne dark spots. it doesn't dry your skin which is nice, but still use lotion just in case. overall absolutely love and will definitely be buying when it runs out"
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Singapore,really effective ,i use this everyday and night heard about this product from tiktok that it removes body odour it really works it also helps with exfoliating 👍🏼 $19 for 240ml is really worth it as well with great results from it 👏🏼
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,USA,Goodbye stinky armpits,"Saw the hype in Tiktok about how great this is for body odour and let me tell you this did not disappoint. I went the whole day running errands, cleaning and gym and I have no body odour whatsoever. Not to mention this does wonders for dark spots and dark underarms. Will definitely be buying again. I love this stuff"
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Australia,Ms,This is my staple skin care product. I can use it on my face scalp and body. It does wonders. Shouldn’t overdo it. Ideally 2-3 times a week and don’t forget SPF

THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Malaysia,Clean and Smooth,"This product can irritate your face pretty bad. However, it does makes your skin smooth and clean. Less whitehead and no bumpy texture. In one week you can already see the difference. Not recommended for people who have active acne as this could hurts the skin. "
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Malaysia,Great product,"Instead of using this at the face, I used it on my hair scalp as a first care before shampoo. I leave it on awhile then wash it off, followed by shampoo and conditioner. It help to remove my dandruff problem away and hair get compliments for looking healthy eversince ."
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Australia,love this so much!,"absolutely love this, so smooth on your skin and not sticky. definitely buy this. it's the best purchase I've ever made. 10/10 and fast shipping, all over great app!"
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Australia,The Ordinary Toner,"Hands down the best toner on the market. Whilst it’s an acid toner it’s gentle and sets your skin up for your serums and moisturising routine. Perfect in the night after cleansing. 
No wonder The Ordinary has become so popular with products like this one available. "

THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Malaysia,the best so far,"Been using this for a few weeks and it's been amazing on the skin. Might feel a bit tingling on the 1st application, but it subsides eventually. I use it only once or twice weekly"
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Malaysia,Liked it ,"I only managed to use the Glycolic 7% Toning Solution twice over two weeks, I was able to see improvements in my skin. It may not be as noticeable to someone else, but I can see the difference in my skin’s texture, which I was actually quite excited about. Each morning after using the toner the night before, the small bumps on my skin looked smaller, and my skin looked more radiant."
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Singapore,Magical,I heard so much things about the ordinary! Aside from its affordable it REALLY WORKS!

THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,USA,Deodorant replacement,I’ve been using this under my armpits for a month and there’s no odor. It does take a while for your body’s ph to balance and get used to not wearing deodorant but do it start using this twice a day and it lightens your armpits too.
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,USA,Very effective,I’ve been using it as a scalp exfoliate and it works great! I get buildup and flakes but this does the trick and keeps my scalp squeaky clean. Haven’t tried it anywhere else yet but I plan to use it on my body to help with ingrown hairs.
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Canada,The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,"I find this product if I use it everyday, my skin gets very dry. I think it is ok for my skin, but I won't buy it again."

THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Canada,Trying as a recommended product for skin cycling,Good value.  Skin feels tingly after use. Testing out skin cycling and this was recommended for dry skin.
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Malaysia,okay,I have been using BHA 2% for quite long so using this toner I don’t see much difference. I use it sometimes in the morning before makeup layer. But yah I don’t think I will buy again.
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Malaysia,ms,"Saw this product on tiktok and decided to buy one for myself to try. And omg my face feels good, I generally have hormonal acne, dry skin, freckles, and large pores. I was afraid that this would cause a breakout because I’m very sensitive to products, however no breakouts in over two weeks! My skin is much softer, more supple and my pores are looking btr than ever 🤎"
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Singapore,Multipurpose and effective!,I love how this toner can be used both on my face after cleansing as well as on my underarms! For the price paid it's so worth cos it's such a big bottle :) 
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,USA,USE ON YOUR SCALP,"I read that using this on your scalp would help with flakes and it DOES! I spray this on scalp and leave it on for 30 minutes before rinsing. Right now I use it about twice a week. Once a week, I use Fable and Maine’s scalp treatment oil after and it’s a god send. If you have dry scalp or just want some good exfoliation you should try this"
THE ORDINARY-Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Canada,Best friend of my skin,I’m in love with this product. It helps my face be clean and fresh. I’m using it on PM time every day.

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,New Zealand,Glow Peel Pads,"these peel wipes are for the streets.
they are tiny and dry out quickly. 
they don't work particularly well in smoothing or exfoliating the skin out unless you scrub them hard against your face, which you shouldn't have to do. 
they also smell disgusting.
i repurchased them a couple times in case i got a dud pack, but nah they just suck"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Australia,absolutely amazing,"such a great product especially for the bargain price!!! Sephora collection never misses! left my skin feeling super hydrated, glowy, but not oily which is great for summer. Definitely gives the glossy skin trend everyone is after ❤️"

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Australia,Glow Peel Pads,So nifty and compact- good for on the go. Found good to take on overnight trips just to freshen the face but seem to really just be glorified baby wipes. Probably won’t buy again.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,New Zealand,lovely peel pads,"I have enjoyed this product very much. It’s soothing, feels great on your skin, and is a very handy when I’m in hospital- mum used these to wipe my face but give me a bit of a face massage which was absolute bliss "

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Australia,These are expired and not taken down,"I liked the product but the ones I received in recent orders were expired. I contacted customer service the first time and they asked me to send it back. I ordered another one a few days later assuming they would’ve removed the expired batch after being notified but nope, still selling expired products knowingly, after two claims from me alone. Customer service is horrible too. They expect you to keep an eye on your return parcel tracking and email them when it arrives at the warehouse like you are suppose to do their job. Don’t even bother. "

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Australia,LOVE ,I love these bad boys better than any high end glycolic pads / toners it works wonders . iv also tried the salicylic but no where near as good but that’s only for my skin 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Australia,Nothing special ,Didn’t feel much effect after the usage. Can be used just like a tonic couple of times per week. Was expecting more to be honest. Will no buy it again.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,USA,Sephora Collection Glow Peel Pads - 60 Pieces,"Love this product!  Makes my skin feel soft and more even. Used to use a similar product, but that had an ingredient that caused irritation and this doesn’t. Not sure why so many problem have issues with the instructions -they’re on the side. Massage your skin morning and night. Do not rinse."

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Australia,just bought it so I didn’t have to pay for shipping ,it’s not really all that. I really don’t notice the difference but sometimes when I was lazy to wash my face id use this after a makeup wipe so remove all the makeup so it did the job I guess but not worth it in my opinion 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Australia,ms,Good exfoliator with glycolic acid. Skin felt fresh and exfoliated. Really good for its price. I have a combination oily skin and uses it 2-3 times a week

doesnt sting for my skin. doesnt break me out "

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Canada,a near dupe for FAB,"these are so great! my holy grail pads are the FAB radiance pads and these are good (I wouldn't say they're AS good, but they come close). will buy again as they are so much cheaper than the FAB ones."

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Australia,easy to use,Great for travel as the peel pads are intuitive and convenient to use. The formula is of a lower concentration and is a great stepping stone into chemical peels. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Singapore,Dried my skin out,Did not like this one bit. Dried my skin out terribly and the pads were very abrasive.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Singapore,Gentle Alternative,"by far the most Gentle peeling pads that ive used. Of cos comparable to other high end brand that is potent with high concentration of ingredients, this pads doesnt leave ur skin all red after using them.. yet it leave ur skin smooth and better absorbtion of other skincare after.. Great for traveling/staycay too as the size is a pocket size just nice to keep even in a handbag ..

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Canada,Patch test if you're acne-prone,Used this for the first time before my friend's wedding.

Make sure to to patch test this one to see if it's for you!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Malaysia,Pretty Decent,"So good for the price if you're looking for a more affordable alternative. Quite gentle if you have a sensitive skin, definitely not irritating or tingly feeling. "

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,USA,breakout city,I haven’t had breakouts since high school (I’m 34) and just ran out of my glycolic toner so I thought I’d try these. My entire chin area has been breaking out horribly! I would not recommend these at all!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Malaysia,Convenient but not convinced ,"It's packaged nicely and the concept is good. One star. But I'm not sure if it does anything for me. The pads stayed moist for at least a few months. That's another one star. But I'm not convinced it does what it says. So, not something i will repurchase. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,New Zealand,Good but be careful,I was using this 2-3 times a week and noticed my skin getting drier so I switched to using once a week and my skin is much better now. Do not use this with other exfoliation products during the same week because your skin will get irratated and dry. Give lots of hydration to your skin. Otherwise its a good AHA product and very affordable . 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Australia,Not sure,I finished a pack and I honestly don't know if there were any results.  I have oily and acne-prone skin.  I can say that using these disks the sending on the skin they leave is pleasant but nothing more.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,New Zealand,Can’t notice much difference ,It’s a nice product for my sensitive skin but it doesn’t do much apart from acting as a good toner. Its not as concentrated for me to use as an exfoliator but I’m happy to continue using it as a toner. Probably won’t purchase it again as I like feeling like my skin is being exfoliated which this doesn’t provide. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Singapore,Affordable toner pads,i think this is a good and more gentle dupe to dr dennis gross's aha bha peel. i also love how it's small in size and affordable! do try this out if u want to refresh ur skincare routine!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,USA,DUPE Alert!,Great Dupe for the First Aid Beauty Radiance Pads. The thickness of these pads are thinner but once you get past that they work just as well and are WAYYY cheaper.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,USA,Not for acne prone skin!,"I loved these at first. But, they eventually broke me out :( They are extremely gentle but couldn't continue to use them because they gave me millia and gave me blind pimples (ingrown pimples). Wouldnt recommend for acne prone skin."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Malaysia,too harsh for my skin,Feel a bit stinging to my facial area.. Using it after washing my face.. No immediate result after using.. No more purchases for me.. Consult advices before using
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Philippines,a good buy,It's not that concentrated compared to the other glow peel pads but it's just right for a quick wipe and lazy nights.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,New Zealand,pretty good ,"Pretty good just don’t use more than 1-2 times a week or you will sensitise your skin, but over all I would repurchase and recommend to friends, and also good packaging"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Malaysia,Good physical exfoliator,"At first I was using this pre-cleanser and upon second check, found out it should be use after cleanser. Good as a physical exfoliator with the embossed side of the wipes because I am really afraid of purging from chemical exfoliators like salicylic acid. Would definitely repurchase "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Malaysia,Not much difference ,"So far, I dont feel any difference. No fragrance which is good. I will consistently using it and see if there is something good happens. I am not sure to buy it again or not in d future,. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,New Zealand,Good for Travel,"Bought these to take on a trip with me so I had some kind of acid treatments for at night. These are good, not great. Not as moist as I'd like them to be, and I'd suggest using them up quickly as once the seal is broken on the tub, they do start drying out. "

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Canada,Haven’t seen an effect,Wanted to see a difference but haven’t? I have used them a couple times and it feels like a soaked make up round? Smells nice but didn’t see any real effect. Wonder if I’m using them incorrectly?
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,USA,not for me,I wanted to like these so bad because they were highly recommended to me. They worked alright for a few days and helped keep the oily skin down but after a few uses I started breaking out. After I stopped use the breakouts went away and there were no new ones so that tells me it were the pads that made me break out. They are gentle and don’t have a bad smell but just didn’t work for my skin. I don’t have sensitive skin either.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,USA,Sephora Collection Glow Peel Pads - 60 Pieces,I’ve been using these for a month and have noticed visible improvement in skin texture. They are pretty gentle. I was using them every day for a bit without any harsh effects. Definitely going to repurchase

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,USA,seriously,I wish there was more in there to use this because it really was helpful with my skin
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Canada,Sephora Collection Glow Peel Pads - 60 Pieces,"I tried the mini size first because I was worried about my skin. I have sensitive, oily skin and have lupus, so I have to be careful about what I use, but I noticed lately that my skin has been dull, although moisturised. The ingredients in these pads are gentile, and I noticed that my skin did actually have a healthier glow after about a week of use. A great product for a great price."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Canada,Sephora Collection Glow Peel Pads - 60 Pieces,These pads changed my skin!! I used to have mini bumps on my forehead and chin and this made them almost non-existent. I would definitely recommend! I use once a day and wouldn’t go back :)
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,USA,Sephora Collection Glow Peel Pads - 60 Pieces,"If you have uneven skin complexion or just feel like your skin looks dull get the glow peel pads!!!! I tried the clarifying pads also but wasn’t as impressed as much as I was with the glow pads. Might try hydrating pads next. Also, Sephora skin care deserves more hype!!!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,USA,Cleared a breakout in just a few days!,"These pads are awesome!  My skin is normal/combination depending on the season and I’ve never had acne or bad breakouts; just one or two small pimples during my period.  I used a facial oil that made me breakout on my cheeks and forehead plus gave me tiny little bumps all over my forehead.  I don’t have sensitive skin so this was surprising and I had no idea what to do so I gave these a try.  My breakout was clear within a few days and the tiny bumps are gone.  After the breakout pimples cleared there were a couple dark spots that I was worried about but I kept using these and the dark spots are almost completely gone.  I’ve only been using them for a little less than two weeks and I’m really impressed with the results.  These worked so quickly to clear my breakout and didn’t have any negative effects on areas where my skin is a little drier; if anything my skin feels more balanced overall.  I’ve used other much more expensive peels but these seem to work a lot better.  I’ve been using them twice a day and might cut back to every other day now that my skin has cleared up, but I’m definitely going to continue buying these."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,USA,Sephora Collection Glow Peel Pads - 60 Pieces,"These pads were just what I needed to get rid of old tired skin cells and help build a healthy, glowing complexion."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,USA,buy now!!,I love these! This is my second or third time buying and I will never go without. I have oily skin and hyperpigmentation (use to struggle with acne)! These clear up my skin SO quickly. It does dry my skin out but that’s the price you pay. Just use moisturizer!
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,New Zealand,good and gentle ,I have bought this just out of curiosity and ended up buying again. It’s good and gentle on skin. It’s makes skin glowing. This is now my go to on the busy days.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Canada,Sephora Collection Glow Peel Pads - 60 Pieces,"I’ve used other, similar products on the past that have almost immediate overnight effects. These didn’t do anything noticeable. I also found them quite “dry” and didn’t have a ton of the liquid. I’d sometimes use two pads since one never felt like enough."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,USA,Great for Daily Use,"I’ve consistently used these for almost two years, and they are a great for daily use, and help keep my skin from looking dull! And they are a great price."

SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Canada,must try!,I’ve been using these pads for just over two weeks and I LOVE what they do for my complexion. I have seen noticeable fading of age spots on my skin and my skin tone is much more even. Highly recommend this product. I have somewhat sensitive skin so I use one pad each morning instead of using an and pm.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,USA,Sephora Collection Glow Peel Pads - 60 Pieces,"I didn't notice much effect from these, I would recommend the Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Peel Pads (which are more expensive but I can see differences after 2-3 uses) to notice more of a skin tone evening"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,USA,Sephora Collection Glow Peel Pads - 60 Pieces,"I don’t use these on my face—they’re too strong!—but they work WONDERS on my KP (concentrated on my upper arms and butt). Took a couple of weeks of daily use, but my 43 year old skin feels so smooth now!"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,USA,Gentle every day exfoliator,"I love these for an everyday exfoliant. They are very gentle, no burning or tingling, but you see results over continued use. I still use a stronger gel peel every week or so, but for the price, I'm sticking to these for every day."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Canada,Sephora Collection Glow Peel Pads - 60 Pieces,Very good for dark spots and acne prone skin. Wish they where in larger packaging tho.
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Canada,Sephora Collection Glow Peel Pads - 60 Pieces,I honestly feel as if I was using water when using this product - potency was very low- at least it didn’t cause my skin to break out- I had glycolic pads in the past and this one felt like concentration is 0.0001%
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Singapore,expensive ,Not sure how effective as I did not keep up with the regime. Am sure u can get a cheaper option with a bottle of liquid and some cotton pads. U probably paying for the convenience 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Singapore,cheap glow pads,first time trying these glow pads from sephora! really affordable price point. suitable for lazy days and those trying out chemical exfoliants. might not do much who are used to actives already
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,New Zealand,Okay,"Convenient little box. The pads are easy to use, nice last step of my cleaning routine, however I did not see any particular effect on my skin. At least they are not irritating."
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Singapore,Ok,I bought this for a friend. Packaging looks very convenient especially for travelling. She said it is an ok product. Maybe i will get it when can travel again. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Australia,Glow pads,As expected they are very comfortable and great to use. After application it does not irritate my skin as my skin is very sensitive. Can be used to give a fresh look to the skin and it definitely removes the dullness from face. Not very strong so suggested for sensitive skin. Don't know about skin peeling as my skin didnot peel after first use. 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Malaysia,Does not work well for me,"I've used it for 2 weeks and I don't see any big changes on my skin and the cotton pad is kinda dry (not watery) so by the time i apply for my whole skin, it would be already dried out so it would be kinda harsh for my skin"
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Singapore,love them!! ,"love these glow peel pads! instantly brightens skin after use. I didn't notice any dryness or skin irritation, quite gentle for peel pads. Will definitely purchase more. "
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,Singapore,love this product!,Highly recommend this peel pad! Have tried other brands glycolic acid but too strong for my skin! Sephora brand items are actually pretty good! Super convenient as you can pick up one pad from the tub! Easy to use and good to bring especially for mini holidays! 
SEPHORA COLLECTION-Glow Peel Pads,New Zealand,good but not completely effective ,"Got rid of some acne scars but not as effective as I’d hoped for, I’m buying it again to see if it works better with some different products - will see how that goes"
JACK BLACK-Oil Control Toner,USA,"Better, affordable options on the market","Didn't like this toner. Felt like it dried my skin out more but didn't subside any acne. It's a shame because I like the face wash, moisturizer, face buff, and glycolic line smoother. I'll stick to The Ordinary face toner which I adore and is much cheaper."
JACK BLACK-Oil Control Toner,Canada,Clean and worth it!,"Not sure what’s with the negative reviews but I guess everyone’s skin is different. I’ve been using a sample size of this product and what can I say, it definitely helps. I have fairly oily skin on my forehead and have been using Jack blacks Glycolic facial wash along with their oil free moisturizer and it worked fairly well, but adding this to the mix has definitely enhanced the reduction in oil, and I’m very happy. Will be purchasing a full size bottle once I run out of the trial size."
JACK BLACK-Oil Control Toner,Canada,JACK BLACK Oil Control Toner,"Not a great toner, left my skin red and irritated after use. Fresh or Kiehl’s are a better option for combo skin"
LANEIGE-Time Freeze Skin Refiner,Malaysia,nice lift,helps lift and tighten the skin for a more youthful appearance. Also good for added hydration for skin. Not irritating for my sensitive skin and smells nice. worked well for combination to oily skin.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,Exfoliate and Glow,"This product certainly gives you that clean wipe and glow the next day. Took about a week to get used to it, initially it would feel like my skin was getting irritated but it settled in a week later. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,can really see a difference,I’ve used this for about 6 weeks now and I can confidently share that all my dark spots and acne scars is either gone or has faded significantly. I will continue using this every night!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,just okay ,"Purchased this because of sale.

OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,does the work,It’s my third time buying this. And I’ve decided to buy the jumbo size cause it really helps with my dark spots from my cystic acne that I’ve recently been having last year. 
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,Tingling and its working,Love the product. It does have tingling feel but goes away after 30sec i think. Leaves skin fresh and clean. Suit my normal to dry skin. But i bet i still need to use bha to compliment my skin concern. I might repurchase this toner when sale comes again hehe.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,Product does not worked,"Bought this toner during the sale, worth it because it's jumbo size. Loved the smell, but the product does not worked on my skin and I can't see any effect."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Philippines,I love it!,I have melasma and pimple scars. I started using this product twice a day and the melasma have significantly faded and so are my pimple scars! My skin is noticeably brighter and now has a fresh glow. I love this product and will buy it again!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,Best clarifying toner ,I’m an addiction to skincare containing acids. Came across this while shopping at Sephora n decided to give it a try. Bought d smaller bottle to try. The fragrance of this toner smells citrusy. After using for just a week only at night i noticed my skin is clearer with lesser spots n breakout. Dark spots seems to lighten or disappeared. Skin is smoother w lesser bumps n make my skin less oily. A toner that gives results in a week n it’s amazing reasonable price is a gd catch! Well done Ole Henriksen!!!👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,Hydrating but…,"At first, I really surprised with this toner because I can feel my dry skin hydrated after 1st time use and leave it overnight..I using it during the night before I went to bed (as instructed)..but after one week of usage, my skin grow more acne..I am so confused right now.."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,Extremely my Favourite!,For now this is the best Toner for my sensitive skin. First time I've tried on free gift and really like the outcome. So I purchased the Jumbo bottle at a discounted price. This toner leave my skin fresh and smell so good. Doesnt leave my skin breakouts like other toner. Really worth buying!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,The best chemical exfoliator there is! Gentle to use everyday but really does the job at keeping my pores clean and face texture even.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,worth the price,I actually bought 2 of these toner. Its very affordable for the jumbo size and during the sale. The expiry date still have a very time to go. It’s fine on my skin. No allergic reaction. I have sensitive skin and may have allergic to certain products. No stingy feeling and no redness. Quick absrobtion too.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,Upgraded to jumbo!,I tried this in the set and loves the clean feel after. Overall my skin looks brighter but my dark spots remained. The jumbo size is great value especially when bought it during Ole promo.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,Toner,I buy it with sale price. worth it. i'm using for 2 weeks and i can see the differences.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,Okey so far ,"my friends were raving about this so decided to try. I love it, don't really think it works drastically but let's see. so far okay doesn't cause any breakouts and I have sensitive skin. I have dry and combi skin for reference. a nice to have but not a must have for me. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Love this toner so much. Leaves skin feeling refreshed and glowy
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,50-50,"It gives you the glow, yes! However, it did slightly irritated my combination skin( was trying it 2 times a week). Perhaps, it’s alil too strong for my skin. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,Value!,This is great value for money. It is a good daily exfoliant and it agrees with most skin types. I would recommend getting it now while there are further discounts!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,so good for oily skin,"helps to reduce the look of dark spots and acne scarring considerably, stings Abit but works wonders. have been using this toner for about 2 years and never disappointed, bought during the sale so extra value "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,It’s a yes,"At first I was unsure.   I thought it made me break out but it didn’t.  It did the opposite.  It helped the breakouts that were active, it’s helping with prior scarring, it’s a dream to use.   I enjoy the light scent and I find myself using it every morning and evening.   It makes for a quick cleanse in the morning to get rid of oil and a nice toner at night.   I buy the jumbo size and would absolutely repurchase as needed.   I don’t know the brand but this product in particular is great."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,great product ,I started using this brand and product for the first time. Toner smells fruity and pleasant. It’s not sticky and feels great on my combination and oily skin. Will recommend trying this product.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Singapore,Great stuff for men!,"Got this for my bf and he loves it! It's his second bottle! I found it a little too strong for my skin, but it seems to work great on his thicker(?) skin? Legit noticed his face getting glowier and less porous-y. "
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Breakouts,It made me break out the first few days I started using it. It did lighten up some of my dark spots but either way created new break outs. I’m going to continue using it a little longer and hopefully it’s just my skin reacting to a new product.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,ACNE (read if you have acne-prone skin),"I bought this after hearing many good reviews from people with acne and acne scarring. I thought it would be great just like the other Olehenrisken products I have tried before (Truth Serum and Pore Balance Facial Sauna Scrub). As someone who have tried different toners containing glycolic acid, I expected this to perform just like these and even better. However, sadly, I was completely wrong! This toner broke me out like crazy. I have been using it for the past couple of weeks and have been getting pimples filled with pus since then. I initially thought that my skin was reacting to the weather changes, simply because I have not added anything new to my skincare routine except for this toner, and as far as I “knew,” one cannot really breakout from a glycolic acid toner. I continued to use this and the breakouts kept getting worse everyday. A few days ago, I randomly thought about whether or not one can breakout from clarifying toners, in general. I went ahead and did some research, and surprise, this could actually happen! I then went to the Olehenriksen website to check out reviews about this particular toner and see if it had caused others to breakout just to find that there were several other reviewers who experienced the same issue. I immediately stopped using this, and thank god, I am no longer getting new breakouts and my existing breakouts are starting to heal. It is kind of sad because this did in fact lighten some of the discoloration on my face, but what is the point if it is gonna give me acne. 

For reference, I have added photos of how my skin looked like around three days ago!"
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,Testing,First time trying this product after reading some good reviews about it. I have some dark spots and pigmentation on my cheeks. Decided to try this since it is on 20% off. And it is a big bottle too.
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,gorgeous!,ole henriksen is da bomb! love their product..pricey but really high quality..and worth it! this the toner need to be used at night as its contained AHA..great smell and quite strong on first few times..after that its great!
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,Ole Henriksen Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,My go to! Always can depend on this toner to help clear up any acne & get rid of scars
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,BEST TONER EVER!!!,"This toner quickly removed brown spots from sun damage and acne scars. I had been using an expensive brand from my dermatologist with minimal results. Out of frustration, I tried this one in a kit I purchased through this website. Within 3 days I could barely believe what Iwas seeing in the mirror. The brown spots were almost gone. Sooooo happy with this product."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,USA,A MUST HAVE!!!,"This is phenomenal product! If you’re considering a toner this is a MUST. Slight lemon/citrus scent, but is mild. I have very dark acne scaring and this completely erased my acne scaring within a 1-2 months. I have been using daily for 3 months now. LOVE LOVE LOVE this. On my second bottle."
OLE HENRIKSEN-Jumbo Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner,Malaysia,Dark Spot Toner 295ml,"First-time user. Saw a few good reviews about the product, hence bought it to give it a try. So far so good, no breakout or negative reactions. Will continue to use it for better result. Price is reasonable for a jumbo size."
FOR BELOVED ONE-Advanced Hyaluronic Acid GHK-Cu Moisturizing Toner,Singapore,Favourite!,"This is my favourite toner, it feels hydrating and cooling when used. My skin feels instantly hydrated after using it as i tend to have tightness after using facial wash. It absorbs instantly so i dont need to wait too long for my next skincare step."
FOR BELOVED ONE-Advanced Hyaluronic Acid GHK-Cu Moisturizing Toner,,Works as a regular toner,"I have combination skin and this works just as a regular toner for me however I did try using it in a foreign country during winter to test its ""moisturizing"" efficacy and my skin did not dry out at all - not sure if it had to do with this toner or just a combination of all my other products as well. Effect might be more obvious for dry skin people."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Essence,USA,Augustinus Bader The Essence,Saw all the AB hype and decided to give the brand a try. Have been using this along with the moisturizer and face wash for months now and honestly have noticed no difference. Will be switching back to my old products after I get every penny out of this stuff but not worth the price in my opinion.
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Essence,USA,Augustinus Bader The Essence,"Love this bottle of magic. A little goes a long way and it does wonders for the skin…it preps it for the next step of this product like which is “The Rich Cream.”  Before using this product; my face had a lot of texture, but after using it; I can say that it visibly shrinks pores and helps with texture while taking care of my sensitive skin."
AUGUSTINUS BADER-The Essence,USA,LOVE!,Can’t live without this!! This whole line has drastically changed my skin.
ESTÉE LAUDER-Soft Clean Silky Hydrating Skincare Lotion,Singapore,estee lauder ,This is the first time trying for this product and fall in love with the beautiful smell . It is not sticky not oily to the face . I will definitely buy again when there is a sale . 
SULWHASOO-Snowise Brightening Water Toner,Singapore,nice,"this toner feels like a gel and it’s tricky to use a cotton pad with this, as the consistency seems a bit too thick for a toner. You might really need to use your palms when applying this, but I prefer to still use a cotton pad because I want my toner to take off excess makeups that didn’t rinse away after washing. Fortunately, the formula spreads very easily and it feels very soothing."
SULWHASOO-Snowise Brightening Water Toner,Singapore,Light and Refreshing ,The toner made my skin feels soft and radiant after applying. It has a mild fragrance and doesn't feel sticky and it absorbed pretty fast into the skin. Overall I quite like it👍
SULWHASOO-Snowise Brightening Water Toner,Singapore,really good! ,"I like the consistency of this product. It absorbs well into the skin, but is abit sticky. There’s also a herbal-ish scent but i personally don’t mind it. I find that my skin is supple and glowy the next day when i use it. Will repurchase :) "
SULWHASOO-Snowise Brightening Water Toner,Singapore,Worth it ! ,"My husband loves it. Brigther skin and Clearer in less than a month. Worth the price. I will definitely try other products in this line. Sulwhasoo is always a great brand. 
"
LANEIGE-Essential Balancing Skin Refiner Light,Singapore,light and refreshing,doesnt leave a sticky feeling and really like how light it is! tried other toners but will always include this in my skincare routines. got it during sephora’s sale so it’s worth it
LANEIGE-Essential Balancing Skin Refiner Light,Singapore,good,"It was a good deal, good product, value for
money. Lovely and useful packaging, really nice item in general. No regrets over it!!! You should totally get this highly recommended "
LANEIGE-Essential Balancing Skin Refiner Light,Singapore,Awesome 🤩 ,"Great product.
Almost a month using it.
It is my first time applying this toner,see different in 2-3wks, so moist and feel so fresh and no irritation or feel dry.
Most of my skin care now is Laneige,
it’s is so good and it’s not that expensive."
LANEIGE-Essential Balancing Skin Refiner Light,Singapore,Worth every penny!,This is my favourite! Has been using this toner for the past few years. Tried other brands of toners too but this is my staple skincare. Texture is light hence good for laying w other serums or creams even during daytime.
LANEIGE-Essential Balancing Skin Refiner Light,Malaysia,It was okay ,I’m not sure how to describe after using this toner because I only feel the same? But I do experienced it differently when I apply it with Emulsion. So I don’t know the difference is because of the combo products that I used or only the toner itself! I rate 3.5 stars because I think I love the smell of it :) 
LANEIGE-Essential Balancing Skin Refiner Light,Philippines,Favorite Toner for my Oily Skin,"My most favorite toner from Laneige! I've been using the Laneige Essential Power Skin Refiner Light for years. And now I can't find it elsewhere. And I found this. I think they rebranded? And now it's called Essential Balancing? Nevertheless, this one is best for oily skin. I also tried the other one - Essential Power Skin Refiner Moisture and while it's good, it's thicker. I guess that one is for dry skin. But this one is far best for me. Makes my skin hydrated and it clears off other impurities after I wash my face. I keep re-purchasing this."
LANEIGE-Essential Balancing Skin Refiner Light,Malaysia,rebecca ,I’ve used many toners before this and by far this is the best one that suits to my combination skin.  Leaves the skin light and fresh. I am hooked ever since. 
LANEIGE-Essential Balancing Skin Refiner Light,Malaysia,Good toner ,Very light toner and suitable for my skin. Feel so refreshing and light after using it. No sticky feeling on my face. Will definitely buy it again in future.
