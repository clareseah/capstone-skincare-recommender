Skincare By Age: 20s, 30s, 40s, 50+, Under 20","A purifying, soothing and reparative toner that makes pores look smaller and skin look brighter.","This toner acts as a pivot between what you remove from the skin surface when you cleanse and what you replenish it with afterwards. The Face Vinegar contains Actibiome, a novel prebiotic that works to calm stressed skin and prevent it from further irritations alongside postbiotics that allow the skin’s beneficial bacteria to flourish. The second active is Hibiscus Vinegar. Extracted from the Hibiscus flower that’s native to Central America, it is rich in acetic acid, with astringent properties, to gently dislodge dirt and unhealthy bacteria. Another important ingredient is tannins, which has been found to regulate sebum. It is also full of antioxidants that help stop free radicals from attacking and degrading skin cells. Oxidative stress is reduced so the skin can remain protected from external ageing factors. The gentle exfoliating action of AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) stimulates cell renewal for a smoother, refined finish.
